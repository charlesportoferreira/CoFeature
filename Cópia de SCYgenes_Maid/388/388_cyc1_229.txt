yeast iso cytochrome c. genetic analysis of structural requirements.. . we describe the use of classical and molecular genetic techniques to investigate the folding, stability, and enzymatic requirements of iso cytochrome c from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. interpretation of the defects associated with an extensive series of altered forms of iso cytochrome c was facilitated by the recently resolved three dimensional structure of iso cytochrome c [() j. mol. biol. , ], and by comparison with the phylogenetic series of eukaryotic cytochromes c. residue replacements that abolish iso cytochrome c function appear to do so by affecting either heme attachment or protein stability; no replacements that abolish electron transfer function without affecting protein structure were uncovered. most nonfunctional forms retained at least partial covalent attachment to the heme moiety; heme attachment was abolished only by replacements of cys and cys, which are required for thioether linkage, and his, a heme ligand. replacements were uncovered that retain function at varying levels, including replacements at evolutionarily conserved positions, some of which were structurally and functionally indistinguishable from wild type iso cytochrome c.
