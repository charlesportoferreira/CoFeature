internal deletions in the yeast transcriptional activator hap have opposite effects at two sequence elements.. . in this report we study the effects of internal deletions of the yeast transcriptional activator hap (cyp) on activity at two dissimilar dna binding sites, upstream activation sequence (uas) of cyc (iso cytochrome c) and cyc (iso cytochrome c). these deletions remove up to amino acids of the residue protein and bring the carboxyl terminal acidic activation domain closer to the amino terminal dna binding domain. surprisingly, the deletions have opposite effects at the two sites; activity at uas increases with deletion size, while activity at cyc decreases. the mutant with the largest deletion, mini hap, has no measurable activity at cyc but binds normally to the site in vitro. in contrast, a protein with the dna binding domain of hap fused to the acidic activation domain of gal is active at both uas and cyc. these findings are discussed in the context of two models that suggest how the dna sequence can alter the activity of the bound hap. in a separate experiment, we generate a mutation in the dna binding domain of hap that requires the addition of zinc for binding to either uas or cyc in vitro. this finding shows that a zinc finger anchors dna binding to both types of hap sites.
