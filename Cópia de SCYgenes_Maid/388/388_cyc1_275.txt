a mutation allowing an mrna secondary structure diminishes translation of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c.. . the cyc o mutation in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a his leu replacement of the normal ala gly sequence at amino acid positions and , which lie within a dispensable region of iso cytochrome c; this mutation can accommodate the formation of a hairpin structure at the corresponding site in the mrna. the amount of the altered protein was diminished to % of the wild type level, whereas the amount of the mrna remained normal. however, in contrast to the normal cyc+ mrna that is associated mainly with four to seven ribosomes, the bulk of the cyc o mrna is associated with one to four ribosomes. these results suggest that the stable secondary structure within the translated region of the cyc mrna diminishes translation by inhibiting elongation.
