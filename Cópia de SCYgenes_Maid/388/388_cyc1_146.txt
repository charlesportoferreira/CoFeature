the structure and function of omega loop a replacements in cytochrome c.. . the structural and functional consequences of replacing omega loop a (residues ) in yeast iso cytochrome c with the corresponding loop of rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c have been examined. the three dimensional structure of this loop replacement mutant repa cytochrome c, and a second mutant repa(val ) cytochrome c in which residue was back substituted to valine, were determined using x ray diffraction techniques. a change in the molecular packing is evident in the repa mutant protein, which has a phenylalanine at position , a residue considerably larger than the valine found in wild type yeast iso cytochrome c. the side chain of phe is redirected toward the molecular surface, altering the packing of this region of omega loop a with the hydrophobic core of the protein. in the repa(val ) structure, omega loop a contains a valine at position , which restores the original wild type packing arrangement of the hydrophobic core. also, as a result of omega loop a replacement, residue is changed from a histidine to asparagine, which results in displacements of the main chain atoms near residue to which residue is hydrogen bonded. in vivo studies of the growth rate of the mutant strains on nonfermentable media indicate that the repa(val ) cytochrome c behaves much like the wild type yeast iso protein, whereas the stability and function of the repa cytochrome c showed a temperature dependence. the midpoint reduction potential measured by cyclic voltammetry of the repa mutant is mv at degrees c. this is mv less than the wild type and repa(val ) proteins ( mv) and may result from disruption of the hydrophobic packing in the heme pocket and increased mobility of omega loop a in repa cytochrome c. the temperature dependence of the reduction potential is also greatly enhanced in the repa protein.
