nmr study of the structural characteristics of variants of yeast iso cytochrome c in which unvaried aromatic residues have been substituted.. . the structures of variants of yeast iso cytochrome c, in which the previously unchanged tyr and tyr + trp have been replaced by phe, have been characterised by nmr. the nmr data indicated that the structures of the variant cytochromes c are very similar to the wild type protein. in particular, the heme environment and interactions of the heme macrocycle were shown to be preserved. the observation of chemical shift differences have allowed for the assessment of conformational changes. the substitution of trp by phe may have caused a small conformational change, a manifestation of which is the observed chemical shift differences at his, val and tyr. the structural basis for the reduction in redox potential accompanying the amino acid substitutions is discussed and the proposal made that the changes in potential are a direct consequence of the side chain properties and do not result primarily from conformational changes.
