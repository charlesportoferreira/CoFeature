a yeast protein with homology to the beta subunit of g proteins is involved in control of heme regulated and catabolite repressed genes.. . the product of the saccharomyces cerevisiae aer gene is responsible for maintaining repression of at least two distinct regulatory pathways. heme activation/repression and catabolite repression. mutations in the gene caused an eightfold increase in the expression of the heme activated cyc gene in the absence of heme, a substantial increase in the expression of the heme repressed anb gene in the presence of heme, and a fold increase in the expression of the catabolite repressed gal gene in the presence of glucose. lesser or no increases in the expression of these genes were observed under derepressed or activation conditions. the aer mutations also caused a large increase in cyc gene expression under all conditions; this gene is subject to heme activation/repression, as well as catabolite repression. the aer gene was cloned and the sequence determined. the large open reading frame contiguous with the transcript from the complementing region encoded a amino acid polypeptide chain with extensive homology to the beta subunit of g proteins. the sequence revealed that aer is the tup gene. a deletion mutation was constructed and the null phenotype was the same as the original mutants. the aer null mutant was shown to have increased aerobic and anaerobic levels of rna encoding the rox repressor, normally expressed only aerobically and responsible for the aerobic repression of anb expression. the increase in both rox and anb rnas aerobically in this mutant suggests that the repressor is nonfunctional in the mutant.
