replacement of cysteine of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c with threonine. improved stability of the mutant protein.. . site directed mutagenesis has been used to change the codon for cysteine of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c to a threonine codon. the resulting protein is active in vivo, is methylated as in the wild type protein and has optical properties indistinguishable from those of the wild type protein. the threonine iso cytochrome c demonstrated fully reversible electrochemical behaviour and a mid point reduction potential of mv versus nhe. in addition, this mutant does not demonstrate a tendency to autoreduce or to dimerize as does the wild type protein. these properties of the threonine mutant establish that it will provide a useful background in which to make subsequent mutations for mechanistic and physical studies of yeast iso cytochrome c.
