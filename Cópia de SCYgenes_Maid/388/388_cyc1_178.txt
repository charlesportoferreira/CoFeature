genetic analysis of yeast iso cytochrome c structural requirements. suppression of gly replacements by an asn ile replacement.. . gly (vertebrate numbering system) is an evolutionarily invariant amino acid located in an electron dense region of cytochrome c. serine, cysteine, and aspartic acid replacements of gly abolished yeast iso cytochrome c function, presumably by destabilizing the mature forms of the altered proteins (). here we report that genetic reversion analysis of these mutants has uncovered a single base pair substitution, encoding an asn ile replacement, that suppresses all three position defects, as well as a gly....gly ser....ser double replacement. in each case the suppressor restored at least partial function to the altered iso cytochromes c, with the sera....ile protein being nearly indistinguishable from the normal protein. the suppressor also affected otherwise normal iso cytochrome c, enhancing the in vivo amount of the protein by about %. while this work was in progress, das et al. (, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa , ) uncovered ile as a suppressor of single gly and his replacements in iso cytochrome c. the ability of ile to suppress amino acid replacements at three different sites, and its effect in isolation from the primary mutations, defines ile as a global suppressor of specific iso cytochrome c structural defects. these data suggest that position plays a critical role in the folding and/or stability of iso cytochrome c.
