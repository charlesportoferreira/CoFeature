use of yeast transformation by oligonucleotides to study dna lesion bypass in vivo.. . we have studied mutagenic specificities of dna lesions in vivo in yeast cyc oligonucleotide transformation assay. we introduced two lesions into oligonucleotides. one was a nucleoside analog, , dihydro h,h pyrimido[, c][,]oxazin one ' deoxyriboside (dp), which is highly mutagenic to bacteria. it is supposed to be a miscoding, but otherwise good template for dna polymerases. the other lesion was the tt pyrimidine( )pyrimidone photoproduct, one of the typical uv lesions, which blocks dna replication. these oligonucleotides were used to transform yeast cyc mutants with ochre nonsense mutation to cyc+. as expected from its templating properties in vitro, the transforming activity of dp containing oligonucleotides was similar to those of unmodified oligonucleotides. results indicated that dp may direct incorporation of guanine and adenine at a ratio of . or more in vivo. an oligonucleotide containing the photoproduct showed the transforming activity of as low as % of that of the corresponding unmodified oligonucleotide. this bypass absolutely required rev gene. the sequence analysis of the transformants has shown that the lesion was read as tt and tc at a ratio of ., indicating its high mutagenic potential.
