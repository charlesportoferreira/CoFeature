redundant ' end forming signals for the yeast cyc mrna.. . the cyc mutation is a bp deletion in the ' untranslated region of the cyc gene, which encodes iso cytochrome c in saccharomyces cerevisiae. this deletion caused a % reduction in the levels of the cyc mrna and protein because of the absence of the normal ' end forming signal. although the ' end forming signal was not defined by previous analyses, we report that concomitant alteration by base pair substitution of three ' end forming signals within and adjacent to the bp region produced the same phenotype as the cyc mutation. furthermore, these signals appear to be related to the previously identified ' end forming signal tatata. a computer analysis revealed that tatata and related sequences were present in the majority of ' untranslated regions of yeast genes. although tatata may be the strongest and most frequently used signal in yeast genes, the cyc+ gene concomitantly employed the weaker signals tt tata, tatgtt, and tattta, resulting in a strong signal.
