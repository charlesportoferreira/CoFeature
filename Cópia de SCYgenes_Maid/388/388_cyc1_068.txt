nmr analysis of cyp(hap) dna binding domain cyc upstream activation sequence interactions. recognition of a cgg trinucleotide and of an additional thymine bp downstream by the zinc cluster and the n terminal extremity of the protein.. . the dna binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator cyp(hap) contains a zinc cluster structure. the structures of the dna binding domain dna complexes of two other zinc cluster proteins (gal and ppr) have been studied by x ray crystallography. their binding domains present, besides the zinc cluster, a short linker peptide and a dimerization element. they recognize, as homodimers, two rotationally symmetric cgg trinucleotides, the linker peptide and the dimerization element playing a crucial role in binding specificity. surprisingly, cyp recognizes degenerate forms of a direct repeat, cggnnntancggnnnta, and the role of its linker is under discussion. to better understand the binding specificity of cyp, we have studied, by nmr, the interaction between the cyp( ) peptide and two dna fragments derived from the cyc upstream activation sequence b. our data indicate that cyp( ) interacts with a cgg and with a thymine bp downstream. the cgg trinucleotide is recognized by the zinc cluster in the major groove, as for gal and ppr, and the thymine is bound in the minor groove by the n terminal region, which possesses a basic stretch of arginyl and lysyl residues. this suggests that the cyp( ) n terminal region could play a role in the affinity and/or specificity of the interaction with its dna targets, in contrast to gal and ppr.
