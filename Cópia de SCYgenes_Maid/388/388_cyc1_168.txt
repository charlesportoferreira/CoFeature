temperature sensitive variants of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c produced by random mutagenesis of codons to .. . in vitro random mutagenesis within the cyc gene from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to produce a library of mutants encompassing codons to of iso cytochrome c. this region consists of an evolutionarily conserved structure within an evolutionarily diverse sequence. the library, on a low copy number yeast shuttle phagemid, was introduced into a yeast strain lacking cytochrome c. the ability of transformants harboring a functional cytochrome c to grow on the non fermentable carbon source glycerol at degrees c and degrees c was used to determine the phenotype of nearly transformants. approximately % of the missense mutants present in the library give rise to the wild type phenotype, % result in the temperature sensitive (cycts) phenotype, and % give rise to the non functional (cyc ) phenotype. phagemids from cycts and cyc transformants were subjected to dna sequence analysis. all the mutations occur within the targeted region. one third of the mutants from cyc transformants and all the mutants from cycts transformants are missense mutants. the remaining mutants from cyc transformants are nonsense or frame shift mutants. missense mutations within the codons for gly, tyr, thr, asn or ile alone are sufficient to produce temperature sensitive behavior both in vivo and in the variant proteins. the deduced amino acid substitutions correlate remarkably well with side chain dynamics, secondary structure and tertiary structure of the wild type protein.
