analysis of the structure and stability of omega loop a replacements in yeast iso cytochrome c.. . omega (omega) loop a, residues in wild type yeast iso cytochrome c, has been deleted and replaced with loop sequences from three other cytochromes c and one from esterase. yeast expressing a partial loop deletion do not contain perceptible amounts of holoprotein as measured by low temperature spectroscopy and cannot grow on nonfermentable media. strains expressing loop replacement mutations accumulate holoprotein in vivo, but the protein function varies depending on the sequence and length of the replacement loop; in vivo expression levels do not correlate with their thermal denaturation temperatures. in vitro spectroscopic studies of the loop replacement proteins indicate that all fold into a native like cytochrome c conformation, but are less stable than the wild type protein. decreases in thermal stability are caused by perturbation of loop c backbone in one case and a slight reorganization of the protein hydrophobic core in another case, rather than rearrangement of the loop a backbone. a single site mutation in one of the replacement mutants designed to relieve inefficient hydrophobic core packing caused by the new loop recovers some, but not all, of the lost stability.
