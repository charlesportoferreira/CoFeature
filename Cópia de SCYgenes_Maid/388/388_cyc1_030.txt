the coiled coil dimerization element of the yeast transcriptional activator hap, a gal family member, is dispensable for dna binding but differentially affects transcriptional activation.. . the heme activator protein hap is a member of the yeast gal family, which consists of transcription factors with a conserved zn()cys() cluster that recognizes a cgg triplet. many members of the gal family contain a coiled coil dimerization element and bind symmetrically to dna as homodimers. however, hap possesses two unique properties. first, hap binds asymmetrically to a direct repeat of two cgg triplets. second, hap binds to two classes of dna elements, uas/cyc and uas/cyc, and permits differential transcriptional activation at these sites. here we determined the residues of the hap dimerization domain critical for dna binding and differential transcriptional activation. we found that the hap dimerization domain is composed of functionally redundant elements that can substitute each other in dna binding and transcriptional activation. remarkably, deletion of the coiled coil dimerization element did not severely diminish dna binding and transcriptional activation at uas/cyc but completely abolished transcriptional activation at uas/cyc. furthermore, ala substitutions in the dimerization element selectively diminished transcriptional activation at uas/cyc. these results strongly suggest that the coiled coil dimerization element is responsible for differential transcriptional activation at uas/cyc and uas/cyc and for making contacts with a putative coactivator or part of the transcription machinery.
