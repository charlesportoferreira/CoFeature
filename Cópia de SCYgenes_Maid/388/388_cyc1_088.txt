degradation of cyc mrna in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae does not require translation.. . several studies have indicated that degradation of certain mrnas is tightly coupled to their translation, whereas, in contrast, other observations suggested that translation can be inhibited without changing the stability of the mrna. we have addressed this question with the use of altered cyc alleles, which encode iso cytochrome c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the cyc mrna, which lacks all in frame and out of frame aug triplets, was as stable as the normal mrna. this finding established that translation is not required for the degradation of cyc mrnas. furthermore, poly(g) tracks were introduced within the cyc mrna translated regions to block exonuclease degradation. the recovery of ' fragments revealed that the translatable and the aug deficient mrnas are both degraded ' &gt;'. also, the increased stability of cyc mrnas in xrn delta strains lacking xrnp, the major ' &gt;' exonuclease, established that the normal and aug deficient mrnas are degraded by the same pathway. in addition, deadenylylation, which activates the action of xrnp, occurred at equivalent rates in both normal and aug deficient mrnas. we conclude that translation is not required for the normal degradation of cyc mrnas, and that translatable and untranslated mrnas are degraded by the same pathway.
