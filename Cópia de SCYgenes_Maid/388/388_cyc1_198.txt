differential stability of two apo isocytochromes c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two forms of cytochrome c, iso cytochrome c and iso cytochrome c, encoded by the genes cyc and cyc, respectively. the amino acid sequences of these two isozymes are approximately % identical. cyc mutants lack both holocytochromes c, because of a deficiency of cytochrome c heme lyase, the enzyme catalyzing covalent attachment of the heme group to apocytochrome c. a deficiency of heme lyase also prevents import into mitochondria. surprisingly, apo iso cytochrome c is absent in cyc strains, although apo iso cytochrome c is present at approximately the same level at which holo iso cytochrome c is found in cyc+ strains. the lack of apo iso cytochrome c is not due to a deficiency of either transcription or translation, but to rapid degradation of the protein. apocytochromes c encoded by composite cytochrome c genes composed of the central portion of iso cytochrome c flanked by amino and carboxyl regions of iso cytochrome c exhibit increased stability compared with apo iso cytochrome c. a region encompassing no more than four amino acid differences between iso and iso cytochromes c is sufficient to partially stabilize the protein. in contrast to what is observed in vivo with the apo forms, the holo forms of the composite isocytochromes c are even less stable to thermal denaturation than iso cytochrome c or iso cytochrome c. either a small region of the sequence of apo iso cytochrome c is involved in degradation of the protein, or the corresponding region in apo iso cytochrome c is preventing degradation. the differential stability of the two isocytochromes c may be part of a regulatory process that increases the proportion of iso cytochrome c under certain physiological conditions.
