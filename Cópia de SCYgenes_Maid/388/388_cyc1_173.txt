further investigations regarding the role of trimethyllysine for cytochrome c uptake into mitochondria.. . . a mutant of the iso cytochrome c gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae has been constructed which contains an arg codon, replacing the normal trimethylated lys at position . . this mutated gene was cloned into a pgem vector and used for the in vitro translation of yeast iso cytochrome c. . utilizing an in vitro mitochondria binding assay, it was found that the mutant cytochrome c could transverse the yeast mitochondrial membrane, however the amount of protein incorporated was fold less that of the trimethylated wild type. . omission of the protein methyltransferase from assays containing the wild type cytochrome c caused only a slight reduction (%) in the amount of protein incorporated. . these results suggest while the lysine residue of apocytochrome c is important for mitochondria uptake, the methylation of this residue seems to play a relatively minor role.
