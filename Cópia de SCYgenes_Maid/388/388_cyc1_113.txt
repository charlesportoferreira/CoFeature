regulation of cytochrome c expression in the aerobic respiratory yeast kluyveromyces lactis.. . transcriptional regulation of the klcyc gene from the aerobic respiratory yeast kluyveromyces lactis has been studied. the klcyc gene produces two transcripts of different sizes, in contrast with the single transcripts found for cyc and cyc from saccharomyces cerevisiae, and for the cyc gene from schwanniomyces occidentalis. both klcyc transcripts respond in the same way to the regulatory signals studied here. the transcription of klcyc is regulated by oxygen and this control is mediated by heme. the klcyc gene is also subject to catabolite repression. heterologous expression in s. cerevisiae mutants reveals that the factors hap and hap take part in the regulatory mechanism.
