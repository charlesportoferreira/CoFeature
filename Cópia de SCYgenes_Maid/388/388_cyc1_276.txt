differential regulation of the duplicated isocytochrome c genes in yeast.. . the two unlinked genes cyc and cyc encode iso cytochrome c and iso cytochrome c, respectively, in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. an examination of the steady state level of cyc and cyc mrnas in normal and mutant strains grown under different conditions, along with previous results of apoprotein levels, demonstrate that cyc and cyc have similar and different modes of regulation. both cyc and cyc mrnas are diminished after anaerobic growth. in contrast, cyc mrna but not cyc mrna is decreased by heme deficiency in hem mutants. although both cyc and cyc mrnas are substantially lowered after growth in glucose medium, there is a difference in the kinetics of glucose derepression. cyc mrna levels rise in the early logarithmic phase of growth before complete exhaustion of glucose, whereas cyc mrna levels rise in the late logarithmic phase when the level of cyc mrna has plateaued. for a brief period before cessation of growth, the level of cyc mrna attains a level corresponding to the high derepressed level of cyc mrna. the high amount of cyc mrna is surprising because iso cytochrome c constitutes only % of the total cytochrome c complement in derepressed cells. we suggest that iso cytochrome c has the potential to comprise a major proportion of cytochrome c under certain physiologic conditions that have not been experimentally defined. the cyc mutant, which lacks the ability to attach heme groups to apocytochromes c, contains both cyc and cyc mrnas in normal amounts. yet, cyc mutants contain only apoiso cytochrome c and not apoiso cytochrome c. the lack of accumulation of apoiso cytochrome c in cyc mutants, which contain cyc mrna, suggests that apoiso cytochrome c is extensively regulated by a post transcriptional process.
