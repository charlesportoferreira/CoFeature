physical analysis of the cor region. a cluster of six genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . six genes, cyc, utr, utr, osm, trnagly, and rad, have been localized within an kilobase region on chromosome x of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the physical structures and the transcripts of these genes were identified by analyzing a normal strain and six deletion mutants by genomic blotting, transcriptional analysis, and gene disruption procedures. the well studied cyc gene encodes iso cytochrome c; the trnagly gene encodes a trna; deletion of osm and rad causes sensitivity to hypertonic medium and uv irradiation, respectively. there were no observable phenotypes in strains having deletions of the utr, utr, and trnagly gene. the high density of transcripts, with little or almost no intragenic regions, indicates that the chromosomal organization of s. cerevisiae resembles the chromosomal organization of procaryotes rather than higher eucaryotes.
