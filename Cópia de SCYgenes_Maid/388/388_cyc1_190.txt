extragenic suppressors of a translation initiation defect in the cyc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cycl allele contains a point mutation that generates an aberrant aug codon upstream of the normal cyc translation initiation codon. mutants containing this allele express only about % of normal iso cytochrome c, presumably due to translation initiation at the upstream aug, termination at a uaa sequence six codons downstream, and failure to reinitiate at the normal aug codon two nucleotides later. both intragenic and extragenic revertants of cycl , expressing elevated levels of iso cytochrome c, have been isolated simply by selecting for growth on lactate medium. here we describe an improved method for isolating and readily distinguishing cis from trans acting suppressors of the upstream aug. eight different genes, designated sua sua, are represented in our current collection of extragenic suppressors; all are recessive and enhance iso cytochrome c levels to % of normal. none of the sua genes is allelic to sui or sui, which encode eif alpha and eif beta, respectively, or to sui. many of the suppressors exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, including slow growth, cold ( degrees c) and heat ( degrees c) sensitivity. these phenotypes have been exploited to clone the sua, sua and sua genes, which are presently being characterized. the structure of cyc and the number of sua genes already uncovered suggest that the sua genes are likely to encode factors affecting several different cellular processes, including translation initiation, mrna stability and possibly transcription start site selection.
