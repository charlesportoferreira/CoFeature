three dimensional solution structure of the cyanide adduct of a metala variant of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c. identification of ligand residue interactions in the distal heme cavity.. . the h nmr spectrum of the the cyanide adduct of a triply mutated saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c (hisgln/metala/cysser) in the oxidized form has been assigned through d noe and d cosy, tocsy, noesy, and noe noesy experiments; protons out of a total of have been assigned. the solution structure, the first of a paramagnetic heme protein, was determined using meaningful noe constraints out of a total of measured noes. the rmsd values at the stage of restrained energy minimization of structures obtained from distance geometry calculations are . +/ . and . +/ . a for the backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. the quality, in terms of rmsd, of the present structure is the same as that obtained for the solution structure of the diamagnetic horse heart ferrocytochrome c [qi, p. x., et al. () biochemistry , ]. the secondary structure elements and the overall folding in the variant are observed to be the same as those of the wild type protein for which the x ray structure is available. however, the replacement of the methionine axial ligand with an alanine residue creates a ligand binding &quot;distal cavity&quot;. the properties of the distal cavity seen in this solution structure are compared to those of other heme proteins.
