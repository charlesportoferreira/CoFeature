mutations of iso cytochrome c at positions and . separate effects on physical and functional properties.. . residues at positions (lysine or arginine) and (glutamate or aspartate) of eukaryotic cytochromes c have been conserved during evolution; cys, however, is found only in yeast cytochrome c. the positively charged residue at position and the negatively charged residue at position are close together in those cytochromes c for which three dimensional structures are available. we have replaced the amino acids at these two positions by cysteine in saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c; in an earlier study, cys was replaced by threonine without negatively influencing the physical or enzymic properties of the protein. the mutated proteins [rc, ct]cytochrome c (iso cytochrome c containing arg &gt;cys and cys &gt;thr mutations), [dc, ct]cytochrome c (iso cytochrome c containing asp &gt;cys and cys &gt;thr mutations) and [rc, dc, ct]cytochrome c (iso cytochrome c containing arg &gt;cys, asp &gt;cys, and cys &gt;thr mutations) are functional in vivo. free sulfhydryl titration shows that the doubly mutated forms each contain one sulfhydryl group while the triple mutant contains two sulfhydryl groups. the stability of mutant [rc, ct]cytochrome c resembles that of [ct] cytochrome c, whereas the stability of [dc, ct]cytochrome c resembles the stability of [rc, dc, ct]cytochrome c. the activity of cytochrome c oxidase using cytochrome c was monitored polarographically. compared to the wild type or [ct]cytochrome c, which shows two kinetic phases with cytochrome c oxidase, [dc, ct]cytochrome c has much the same profile; [rc, ct]cytochrome c and [rc, dc, ct]cytochrome c exhibit one kinetic phase with decreased activity. electron transfer activity of the mutant cytochromes c is inhibited by hg+. the inhibition is highest for the triple mutant, less for [rc, ct]cytochrome c, even less for [dc, ct]cytochrome c and insignificant for the wild type. it would appear as though the stability of the triple mutant follows the changes that result from the asp &gt;cys mutation while the activity changes follow those of the arg &gt;cys mutation.
