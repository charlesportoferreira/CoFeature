mbr and mbr, two related yeast genes that can suppress the growth defect of hap, hap and hap mutants.. . two new yeast genes, named mbr and mbr, were isolated as multicopy suppressors of the growth defect of a strain lacking the hap transcriptional activator. both genes when overexpressed can also suppress the growth defect of hap and hap null mutants. however, overexpression of mbr cannot substitute for the hap// complex in activation of the cyc gene. nucleotide sequencing of mbr and mbr revealed that these two genes encode serine rich, hydrophilic proteins with regions of significant homology. the functional importance of one of these conserved regions was shown by mutagenesis. disruption of mbr leads to a partial growth defect on glycerol medium. disruption of mbr has no major effect but the double disruptant shows a synthetic phenotype suggesting that the mbr and mbr gene products participate in common function.
