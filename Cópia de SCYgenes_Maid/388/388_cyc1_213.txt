a polypeptide chain refolding event occurs in the gly variant of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . the replacement of phe in yeast iso cytochrome c by a glycine residue substantially alters both the tertiary structure and electron transfer properties of this protein. the largest structural change involves a polypeptide chain refolding of residues through . refolding places glycines , and immediately adjacent to the plane of the heme group in a spatial positioning comparable to that of the phenyl ring of phe in the wild type protein. despite this perturbation in structure, solvent accessibility computations show that heme solvent exposure has not increased in the gly variant protein. however, refolding does result in the introduction of a number of polar groups into the hydrophobic heme pocket. this appears to be responsible for the decreased reduction potential of the heme in this protein. the present study, along with that of the ser variant protein (louie et al., b), clearly establishes the link between dielectric constant within the heme crevice and reduction potential. the further anomalously low electron transfer activity of the gly variant protein would appear to arise from two factors. first, the polypeptide chain medium now adjacent to the heme is unable to facilitate electron transfer in a manner similar to that of the aromatic side chain of phe. second, polypeptide chain refolding significantly alters the surface contour of the gly protein rendering it less suitable to interact with the corresponding complementary surfaces of redox partners. our data support the conclusion that phe plays a number of roles in the electron transfer process mediated by yeast iso cytochrome c. these include the maintenance of the heme environment, provision of an optimal medium along the path of electron transfer and formation of interactions at the contact interface in complexes with redox partners.
