mutations that alter transcriptional activation but not dna binding in the zinc finger of yeast activator hapi.. . transcription of eukaryotic genes requires an interaction between transcription factors that bind to the tata box region, and transcriptional activators that bind to upstream activating sequences (uass) or enhancers. several yeast upstream transcriptional activators, such as gcn, gal and hap, seem to contain separate domains for binding to dna and activating transcription. the expression of the cytochrome genes cyc and cyc is controlled by hap, which binds to dissimilar dna sequences in uas of cyc and the uas of cyc. hap has a zinc finger dna binding domain between amino acid residues and , and a highly acidic c terminal activation domain between residues , and , (ref. ). a mutant allele of the hap gene, hap , leads to a change in ser to arg , immediately adjacent to the zinc finger in the dna binding domain. the hap mutation specifically abolishes the ability of the protein to bind to uas, but greatly increases the ability of the protein to activate transcription of cyc. we now report that this increase in activation is mediated solely by the cyc uas and the hap protein, and also, that it is not caused by an altered binding affinity of the protein for the cyc uas. furthermore, even by substituting other amino acids at position and over expressing the resulting derivatives in vivo we were unable to increase activity at the uas of cyc to the level obtained with hap . this rules out the possibility that the hap mutation increases transcriptional activation by abolishing competition by uas and uas like sites for the protein. we thus conclude that hap is a better activator of transcription than the wild type protein when bound to the uas of cyc. moreover, our findings indicate that in addition to the acidic activation domain, the zinc finger dna binding domain participates directly in the activation of transcription.
