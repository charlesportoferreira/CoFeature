regulation of interprotein electron transfer by residue of yeast cytochrome c.. . yeast iso cytochrome c (cc) mutants have been constructed with phe, tyr, gly, ser, leu, and ile at position , each with thr substituted for cys at position . their long range electron transfer with zinc substituted cytochrome c peroxidase (znccp) has been studied by two kinetic techniques. the charge separated complex, [(znccp)+,feiicc] converts to [znccp,feiiicc] by a single, intracomplex electron transfer step that is not governed by &quot;gating&quot; through possible rapid dissociation of the complex or isomerization (for example, heme ligand) by feiicc subsequent to its formation from feiiicc. in every variant with an aliphatic residue at position of cc, the rate of this electron transfer process is approximately () slower at approximately degrees c than for the two variants with aromatic residues.
