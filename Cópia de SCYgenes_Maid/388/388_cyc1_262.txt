mutational alterations induced in yeast by ionizing radiation.. . the cycl ochre (uaa) mutant and the cycl amber (uag) mutant of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were reverted with x rays and alpha particles. the amino acid sequence changes of iso cytochromes c from of the intragenic revertants were determined by amino acid analysis and peptide mapping, aided by partial amino acid sequencing of revertants. in addition, the dna segments encompassing unusual mutations with complex changes were cloned and sequenced. this study and previous studies of other revertants of cycl and cycl revealed that ionizing radiation primarily induces single base pair substitutions; of the revertants arose by transversions and transitions without any apparent preference. however, the a x t t x a substitution at the first base pair for the cycl uag codon, leading to the normal protein, was not detected, nor was it found previously in revertants of cycl obtained spontaneously or induced with various other mutagens; apparently, there is a prohibition of certain base pair substitutions at certain sites in dna. in addition, of the revertants arose by multiple changes within a short region of base pairs. these consisted of the deletion of base pairs, the substitution of base pairs, and different kinds of substitutions of two base pairs. compared to other mutagens previously tested with the cycl system, ionizing radiation produces the most random types of base pair substitutions.
