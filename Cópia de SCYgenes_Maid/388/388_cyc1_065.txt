some dna targets of the yeast cyp transcriptional activator are functionally asymmetric evidence of two half sites with different affinities.. . cyp protein is a yeast transcriptional regulator which contains a zinc cluster in its dna binding domain. it was recently shown by selecting random cyp binding sites that cyp protein recognizes with a higher affinity targets containing the cggnnntancgg consensus sequence. notably, this ideal sequence is however not found in wild type cyp target sites. in order to investigate how cyp protein actually binds to its targets, mutations were introduced in three of them (uas a/cyc, uas a/cyb, uas/cyc) and the consequences towards the binding of purified cyp ( ) peptide were analyzed. our data support the following conclusions. (a) when the sequence element contains two cggs and no ta, both cggs are essential for binding. (b) if the sequence element contains only the right cgg and the ta, both are sufficient but indispensable for the binding of cyp. (c) when two cgcs and the ta are present, the right cgc, and not the left one, is essential for the binding of cyp. (d) cyp ( ) peptide is usually a monomer in solution but binds dna as a dimer. finally, we found evidence for the presence of two half sites with different measured affinities in the asymmetric sequences of some cyp targets.
