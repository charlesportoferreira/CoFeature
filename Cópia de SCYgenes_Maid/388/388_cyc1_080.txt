proton nmr assignments and magnetic axes orientations for wild type yeast iso ferricytochrome c free in solution and bound to cytochrome c peroxidase.. . extensive proton hyperfine shifted resonance assignments have been made for wild type yeast iso ferricytochrome c when it is free in solution and when it is noncovalently complexed to resting state cytochrome c peroxidase. complete heme proton resonance assignments were made for free iso ferricytochrome c, while for ccp complexed iso ferricytochrome c, % of heme proton assignments were made. additional proton resonance assignments were made for hyperfine shifted protons of amino acids near the heme. these assignments allowed identification of the most extensive set of complex induced proton shifts yet reported for ccp/cytochrome c complexes. several purely dipolar shifted resonances from heme vicinity amino acid protons were also assigned in both free and complexed iso ferricyt c. both sets of resonance assignments allowed assessment of the origin of proton complex induced shifts. using the assigned dipolar shifted proton resonances as a basis, the orientations of the principal axis systems of the paramagnetic susceptibility tensors for free and cytochrome c peroxidase bound iso ferricytochrome c were elucidated. the results indicated that the iso ferricytochrome c magnetic axis system orientation shifts significantly upon complex formation. the direction of the complex induced shifts for heme proton resonances is largely accounted for by the magnetic anisotropy changes. however, analysis of heme complex induced shifts also reveals local changes in magnetic environment for two heme substituents, presumably through a specific structure change.
