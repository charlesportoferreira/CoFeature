differential mismatch repair can explain the disproportionalities between physical distances and recombination frequencies of cyc mutations in yeast.. . recombination rates have been examined in two point crosses of various defined cyc mutations that cause the loss or nonfunction of iso cytochrome c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. recombinants arising by three different means were investigated, including x ray induced mitotic recombination, spontaneous mitotic recombination, and meiotic recombination. heteroallelic diploid strains were derived by crossing cyc mutants containing a series of alterations at or near the same site to cyc mutants containing alterations at various distances. marked disproportionalities between physical distances and recombination frequencies were observed with certain cyc mutations, indicating that certain mismatched bases can significantly affect recombination. the marker effects were more pronounced when the two mutational sites of the heteroalleles were within about base pairs, but separated by at least base pairs. two alleles, cyc and cyc , which arose by g.c c.g transversions at nucleotide positions and , respectively, gave rise to especially high rates of recombination. other mutations having different substitutions at the same nucleotide positions were not associated with abnormally high recombination frequencies. we suggest that these marker effects are due to the lack of repair of either g/g or c/c mismatched base pairs, while the other mismatched base pair of the heteroallele undergoes substantial repair. furthermore, we suggest that diminished recombination frequencies are due to the concomitant repair of both mismatches within the same dna tract.
