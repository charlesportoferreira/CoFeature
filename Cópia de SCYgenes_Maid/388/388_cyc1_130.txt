cloning and characterisation of the cytochrome c gene of aspergillus nidulans.. . the cytochrome c gene (cyca) of the filamentous fungus aspergillus nidulans has been isolated and sequenced. the gene is present in a single copy per haploid genome and encodes a polypeptide of amino acid residues. the nucleotide sequence of the a. nidulans cyca gene shows % identity to the dna sequence of the neurospora crassa cytochrome c gene, and approximately % identity to the sequence of the saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c gene (cyc). the s. cerevisiae cyc gene was used as a heterologous probe to isolate the homologous gene in a. nidulans. the a. nidulans cytochrome c sequence contains two small introns. one of these is highly conserved in terms of position, but the other has not been reported in any of the cytochrome c genes so far sequenced. expression of the cyca gene is not affected by glucose repression, but has been shown to be induced approximately tenfold in the presence of oxygen and three to fourfold under heat shock conditions.
