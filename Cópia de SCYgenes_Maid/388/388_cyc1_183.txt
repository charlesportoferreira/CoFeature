direct electrochemistry of proteins. investigations of yeast cytochrome c mutants and their complexes with cytochrome b.. . direct electrochemistry of site specific mutants of yeast iso cytochrome c (cyt c) and their complexes with bovine cytochrome b (cyt b) has been investigated at edge plane pyrolytic graphite (epg) and bis( pyridyl) disulphide modified gold electrodes. structure/function relationships have been investigated with the particular aim of clarifying the factors controlling the interactions of proteins at electrode/electrolyte interfaces and the determinants for direct electrochemistry in ternary protein/protein/electrode adducts, e.g. cyt c/cyt b/epg. investigations of the cyt c mutants alone revealed a variety of electrochemical responses. all the mutants show similar voltammetric reversibility at modified gold electrodes, whereas at epg electrodes the reversibility follows the order. asnile cysthr greater than cysthr greater than asnala cysthr. mid point potentials follow the order. argile (+ +/ mv vs. standard calomel electrode) greater than cysthr (+ +/ mv) greater than lysgln (+ +/ mv) approximately lysasp (+ +/ mv) greater than asnala cysthr (+ +/ mv) greater than asnile cysthr ( +/ mv). the structural basis for these differences is briefly discussed. when these mutants are bound to cyt b, the differences in electrochemical response are greatly enhanced in the ternary cyt c/cyt b/epg adducts. a minimal analysis of these differences supports a model of multiple overlapping binding and recognition domains on cyt c which may be finely tuned to allow ternary complex formation so that a single site variation could modify or abolish direct electrochemistry in the ternary adduct.
