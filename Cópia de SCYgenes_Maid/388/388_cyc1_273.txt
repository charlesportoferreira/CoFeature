crystallization and preliminary diffraction data for iso cytochrome c from yeast.. . deep red crystals of the electron transfer protein, iso cytochrome c from yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), have been obtained from a % saturated solution of (nh)so containing mg protein/ml, . m sodium phosphate and adjusted to ph .. the space group is p()() (or p()()) with a = b = . a, c = . a and z = . crystals are stable for at least ten days in the x ray beam and diffract to better than . a resolution. comparable and morphologically similar crystal forms of three iso cytochrome c mutants at phe, a pivotal residue in the electron transport chain, have also been obtained.
