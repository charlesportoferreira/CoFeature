kinetics of the intracellular availability of heme after supplementing a heme deficient yeast mutant with aminolevulinate.. . the aminolevulinic acid synthetase deficient yeast mutant ole (bard, m., woods, r.a. &amp; haslam, j.m. () biochem. biophys. res. commun. , ), pregrown in a aminolevulinic acid containing medium, can grow on glucose or galactose medium in the absence of heme for about generations. when supplemented with aminolevulinate before their th cell division, the cells can be induced to full respiratory competence. from the measurement of heme dependent parameters (e.g. respiration, transcription of iso cytochrome c mrna and the post translational proteolytic processing of the heme free intermediate precursor of cytochrome c to its heme containing mature form) it can be judged that heme is available in the cell about one hour after the addition of aminolevulinate. the onset of respiration, however, does not occur to an appreciable extent before the rd hour of induction. the heme analogue deuteroporphyrin ix prevents respiratory adaptation but yet effects the transcription of heme controlled genes.
