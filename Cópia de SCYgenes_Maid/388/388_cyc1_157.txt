hap positive control mutants specific for one of two binding sites.. . the expression of the yeast cyc and cyc genes is controlled by the hap activator. a gal like zinc finger (residues ) specifies binding to the dissimilar sites uas (of cyc) and cyc, and an acidic domain (residues ) is essential for activation of transcription. to analyze how hap binds to uas and cyc, we performed saturation mutagenesis of the dna binding domain and recovered mutants with altered activity. class mutants had a reduced activity at both uas and cyc, and class mutants selectively eliminated activity at cyc. surprisingly, several mutants of both classes exhibited wild type dna binding, indicating that they were specifically defective in activation. these positive control (pc) mutants alter residues that bracket the zinc finger. we explain these mutants in a model involving cofactor proteins that bind uas and cyc along with hap. the existence of pc mutants that only affect activity at cyc raises the possibility that different cofactors may exist for uas and cyc.
