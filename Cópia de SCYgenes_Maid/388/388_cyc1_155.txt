the yeast sua gene encodes a homolog of human transcription factor tfiib and is required for normal start site selection in vivo.. . mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae sua gene were isolated as suppressors of an aberrant atg translation initiation codon in the leader region of the cyc gene. molecular and genetic analysis of the cloned sua gene demonstrated that sua is a single copy, essential gene encoding a basic protein (calculated mr of ,) that is homologous to human transcription factor tfiib. analysis of cyc transcripts from sua strains revealed that suppression is a consequence of diminished transcription initiation at the normal start sites in favor of initiation at downstream sites, including a major site between the aberrant and normal atg start codons. a similar effect was found at the adh locus, establishing that this effect is not cyc gene specific. thus, sua encodes a yeast tfiib homolog and functions in transcription start site selection.
