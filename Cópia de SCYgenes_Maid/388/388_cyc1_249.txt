enzymatic methylation of in vitro synthesized apocytochrome c enhances its transport into mitochondria.. . the gene for iso cytochrome c from saccharomyces cerevisiae was recloned into a psp vector containing an active bacteriophage sp promoter. the iso cytochrome c gene was cloned as an base pair xhoi hindiii fragment. when the resulting plasmid was digested at the hindiii site bases downstream from the termination codon of the gene and transcribed in vitro using sp rna polymerase, full length transcripts were produced. the sp iso cytochrome c mrna was translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, and the protein products were analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. one major band with a molecular weight of , was detected by autofluorography and coincided with the coomassie staining band of apocytochrome c from s. cerevisiae. the product was also shown to be identical with that of standard yeast apocytochrome c on an isoelectrofocusing gel. the in vitro synthesized iso apocytochrome c was enzymatically methylated by adding partially purified s adenosyl l methionine.cytochrome c lysine n methyltransferase (protein methylase iii, ec ...) from s. cerevisiae along with s adenosyl l methionine to the in vitro translation mixtures. the methylation was shown to be inhibited by the addition of the methylase inhibitor s adenosyl l homocysteine or the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin. the principal type of methylated amino acid in the protein was found to be epsilon n trimethyllysine which accounted for % of the total. finally, the methylation of in vitro synthesized iso apocytochrome c was found to increase its import into mitochondria isolated from s. cerevisiae fold over unmethylated protein, but not into rat liver mitochondria. this suggests that methylation facilitates the import of apocytochrome c into mitochondria by a specific receptor mechanism.
