rna processing generates the mature ' end of yeast cyc messenger rna in vitro.. . in whole cell extracts of saccharomyces cerevisiae, incubation of precursor mrna transcripts encoding the sequences essential in vivo for forming the ' end of the iso cytochrome c mrna (cyc) revealed an endonuclease activity with the characteristics required for producing the mature mrna ' end. the observed cleavage in vitro is (i) accurate, occurring at or near the polyadenylation site of cyc rna, (ii) to percent efficient, (iii) adenosine triphosphate dependent, (iv) specific for the ' ends of at least two yeast pre mrna's, and (v) absent with related pre mrna's carrying mutations that abolish correct ' end formation in vivo. in addition, a second activity in the extract polyadenylates the product under appropriate conditions. thus, the mature ' ends of yeast mrna's may be generated by endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation rather than by transcription termination.
