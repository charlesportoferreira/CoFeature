cytochrome c methylation.. . in this review, protein methylation is outlined in general terms, highlighting the major amino acids that are methylated and some of the proteins in which they are found. the majority of the review examines the methylation of cytochrome c at lys of lower eukaryotes as a possible model for methylation studies. early work involving the purification and characterization of the methyltransferase responsible for this methylation indicated cytochrome c was methylated posttranslationally, yet prior to import into the mitochondria. methylation in vitro occurred only at the in vivo methylation site and only on cytochrome c. later studies using in vitro translated apocytochrome c revealed that methylated, as compared with unmethylated, apocytochrome c was imported preferentially into yeast, but not rat liver, mitochondria. efforts to discover the reasons for this preference have shown that methylation of apocytochrome c dramatically lowers its isoelectric point (against a predicted increase) and decrease its stokes radius. a possible mechanism for these differences involving the disruption of hydrogen bonds is presented here with space filling models. finally, the in vivo significance of this modification is also discussed.
