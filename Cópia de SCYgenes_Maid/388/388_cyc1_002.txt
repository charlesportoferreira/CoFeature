evaluation of cooperative interactions between substructures of iso cytochrome c using double mutant cycles.. . a double mutant cycle has been used to evaluate interaction energies between the global stabilizer mutation asparagine &gt; isoleucine (ni) in iso cytochrome c and mutations producing single surface histidines at positions , , , , , , and . these histidine mutation sites are distributed through the four cooperative folding units of cytochrome c. the double mutant cycle starts with the iso cytochrome c variant actm, a variant with no surface histidines and with asparagine at position . isoleucine is added singly at position , actmi variant, as are the surface histidines, achx variants, where x indicates the histidine sequence position. the double mutant variants, achxi, provide the remaining corner of the double mutant cycle. the stabilities of all variants were determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation and interaction energies were calculated between position and each histidine site. six of the seven double mutants show additive (achi, achi, achi, achi, and achi) stability effects or weak interaction energies (achi) of the histidine mutations and the ni mutation, consistent with cooperative effects on protein folding and stability being sparsely distributed through the protein structure. the achi variant shows a strong favorable interaction energy, . +/ . kcal/mol, between the ni mutation in one substructure and the addition of his to an adjacent substructure. the data are consistent with an entropic stabilization of the intersubstructure hydrogen bond between his and glu by the ile mutation.
