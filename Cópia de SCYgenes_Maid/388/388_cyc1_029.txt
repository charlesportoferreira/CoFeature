cytochrome c methyltransferase, ctmp, of yeast.. . cytochromes c from plants and fungi, but not higher animals, contain methylated lysine residues at specific positions, including for example, the trimethylated lysine at position in iso cytochrome c of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. testing of , strains of s. cerevisiae, each overproducing a different open reading frame fused to glutathione s transferase, previously revealed that yhrw was associated with an activity that methylated horse cytochrome c. we show here that this open reading frame, denoted ctmp, is specifically responsible for trimethylating lysine of iso cytochrome c. unmethylated forms of cytochrome c but not other proteins or nucleic acids are methylated in vitro by ctmp produced in s. cerevisiae or escherichia coli. iso cytochrome c purified from a ctm delta strain is not trimethylated in vivo, whereas the kr mutant form, or the trimethylated lys form of iso cytochrome c, are not significantly methylated by ctmp in vitro. like apocytochrome c, but in contrast to holocytochrome c, ctm lp is located in the cytosol, consistent with the view that the natural substrate is apocytochrome c. the ctm delta strain lacking the methyltransferase did not exhibit any growth defect on a variety of media and growth conditions, and the unmethylated iso cytochrome c was produced at the normal level and exhibited the normal activity in vivo. ctmp and cytochrome c were coordinately regulated during anaerobic to aerobic transition, a finding consistent with the view that this methyltransferase evolved to act on cytochrome c.
