sequence and chromosomal localization of two pet genes required for cytochrome c oxidase assembly in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the nuclear genes pet and pet are required for the assembly of active cytochrome c oxidase in s. cerevisiae, yet their gene products are not subunits of the final assembled cytochrome c oxidase complex. plasmids bearing pet or pet were isolated by their ability to complement the pet or pet mutations, respectively. by restriction mapping, subcloning, and deletion analysis of yeast dna fragments that complement these mutations, the pet and pet genes were localized to smaller regions of dna, which were then sequenced from both strands. the pet open reading frame is of codons and the pet open reading frame is of codons. neither the pet nor pet dna sequences have been reported previously, and the derived amino acid sequences of the pet and pet open reading frames exhibit no significant primary amino acid sequence similarity to other protein sequences available in the nbrf data base, or from translated genbank sequences. by hybridization of pet or pet probes first to a chromosome blot and next to a library of physically mapped fragments of yeast genomic dna, the map locations of the pet and pet genes were determined. pet is located on chromosome v near the his gene and pet is located on chromosome x near the cyc gene.
