effect of ph on the iso cytochrome c denatured state. changing constraints due to heme ligation.. . the effect of ph on the denatured state ( m guanidine hydrochloride) was evaluated with fluorescence spectroscopy for four variants of iso cytochrome c, actm (no surface histidines), ach (surface histidine at position ), ach (surface histidine at position ), and achi (stabilizing i mutation added to ach). changes in the compactness and the heme ligation of the denatured state, as a function of ph, were monitored through changes in trp heme fluorescence quenching. with the actm and ach variants, no change in the fluorescence intensity occurs from ph to . however, for the ach and achi variants the fluorescence intensity drops significantly between ph and , consistent with his binding to the heme of cytochrome c. between ph and fluorescence intensity increases again, indicating that the his is displaced from the heme. the data are consistent with lysines and being the primary heme ligands at alkaline ph, under denaturing conditions. this conclusion was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis. thermodynamic analysis indicates that heme ligand affinity in the denatured state is controlled primarily by sequence position (loop size) and that when histidines are present they inhibit lysine ligation until approximately ph . . as compared to ph . with the actm variant. thus, at physiological ph, histidine ligands provide the primary constraint on the denatured state of cytochrome c. the heme trp distance in the denatured state of iso cytochrome c, derived from analysis by forster energy transfer theory, is approximately a at ph and , much shorter than the random coil prediction of a. surprisingly, the heme trp distance in the his bound conformation only drops to approximately a, consistent with an extended conformation for the short polypeptide segment separating heme and trp .
