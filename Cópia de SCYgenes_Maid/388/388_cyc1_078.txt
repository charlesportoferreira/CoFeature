a histidine variant of yeast iso cytochrome c that strongly affects the energetics of the denatured state.. . iso cytochrome c has been engineered to remove all histidine residues not involved in heme ligation in the native state to produce a variant designated tm. single histidine residues were then introduced at positions , tm + his, and , tm + his. since histidine residues not involved in native state heme ligation are known to replace the methionine heme ligand in denatured cytochrome c, these variants were expected to affect the structure of the denatured state. guanidine hydrochloride denaturations were performed to assess the stability of these proteins relative to the wild type protein. the free energy difference for heme ligation in the denatured state was assessed by ph titration. the experimentally observed mutation induced change (delta deltag(d state)) in the free energy of heme ligation for unfolded tm + his versus tm + his is . kcal/mol. the expected mutation induced change in delta deltag(d state) calculated for a random coil unfolded state is + kcal/mol. thus, unfolded tm + his has residual structure stabilizing its denatured state by . kcal/mol relative to tm + his. the results imply that the denatured state can contribute significantly to mutation induced changes in the free energy of unfolding of a protein.
