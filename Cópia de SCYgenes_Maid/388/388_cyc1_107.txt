stabilizing amino acid replacements at position in yeast iso cytochrome c. in vivo and in vitro effects.. . position of iso cytochrome c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was systematically replaced with all possible amino acids to investigate the molecular basis of the &quot;global suppressor&quot; activity for the ni mutation. isogenic strains containing the variant proteins were made with a mixed oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis technique in vivo. a relationship between thermodynamic protein stability and cellular protein levels was established by comparing direct spectroscopic measurements of cytochrome c levels in vivo with the thermodynamic parameters from guanidine hydrochloride denaturation and microcalorimetric measurements. reversible denaturation data show that, within a large group of amino acid side chains, the thermodynamic stabilization at position is related to the hydrophobicity of the side chain at that site.
