substitutions of proline in yeast iso cytochrome c. analysis of residues compatible and incompatible with folding requirements.. . fine structure genetic mapping previously revealed numerous nonfunctional cyc mutations having alterations at or near the site corresponding to amino acid position of iso cytochrome c from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna sequencing of the alterations in four of these cyc mutations indicated that the normal pro was replaced by leu . revertants containing at least partially functional iso cytochromes c were isolated, and the alterations were analyzed by dna sequencing and protein analysis. specific activities of the altered iso cytochromes c were estimated in vivo by growth of the strains in lactate medium; compared to normal iso cytochrome c with pro , the following activities were associated with the following replacements. approximately % for val , approximately % for thr , approximately % for ser , approximately % for ile , and % for leu . in order to develop an understanding of the factors that determine whether or not an altered iso cytochrome c will function, we undertook a theoretical analysis which led to the conclusion that the activity of the proteins was dependent on both short and long range interactions. short range interactions were estimated from studies on known protein structures which gave the likelihood that various amino acids would be found in a local backbone configuration similar to the native protein; long range interactions with the rest of the molecule were analyzed by considering the size of the side chain. we believe this approach can be used to analyze a wide variety of mutant proteins.
