distinct cis acting signals enhance ' endpoint formation of cyc mrna in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cyc mutant of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a bp deletion in the ' untranslated region of the cyc gene, resulting in cyc mrnas that are elongated, presumably labile, and reduced to % of the normal level. analysis with s nuclease and a novel pcr procedure revealed that the low amount of cyc mrna contained many discrete ' termini at certain sites, ranging from the wild type position to over nucleotides (nt) downstream. the cyc mrna deficiency was completely or almost completely restored in eight intragenic revertants that contained six different single and multiple base pair changes within a bp region downstream from the translation terminator codon. two of the six different reversions formed the sequence tag...tatgta, whereas the other four reversions created the sequences tatata or tacata. the positions of these revertant sequences varied, even though they caused an increased use of specific major downstream mrna ' endpoints, apparently identical to those seen in the cyc mrna. however, several revertants contained minor end points not corresponding to any of the cyc mrnas. the capacity of these three signals to form ' ends was confirmed with sequences constructed by site directed mutagenesis. we therefore suggest that the production of ' termini of yeast mrna may involve at least two functionally distinct elements working in concert. one type of element determines the sites of preferred ' mrna termini, as represented by the cyc termini. the second type of element, which includes tag...tatgta and tatata motifs, operates at a distance to enhance the use of the downstream ' preferred sites.(abstract truncated at words)
