dramatic thermostabilization of yeast iso cytochrome c by an asparagine isoleucine replacement at position .. . two saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast mutants, cyc and cyc , contain nonfunctional and presumably unstable forms of iso cytochrome c due to gly ser and his pro replacements, respectively. second site reversions that produced asn ile replacements at least partially restored function, presumably by alleviating the instability of these two altered iso cytochromes c. introduction of the ile replacement by site directed mutagenesis in an otherwise normal protein resulted in a degrees c increase in the transition temperature (tm), corresponding to over a fold increase in the free energy change (delta g degrees) for thermal unfolding.
