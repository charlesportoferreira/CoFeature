increasing the redox potential of isoform of yeast cytochrome c through the modification of select haem interactions.. . the oxidation reduction potential of eukaryotic cytochromes c varies very little from species to species. we have introduced point mutations into isoform of yeast cytochrome c (iso cytochrome c) to selectively engineer a protein with a higher redox potential. of the ten different mutant proteins generated for the present investigation yr, yk and wh were found to be non functional. three other mutant proteins, lm, lt and tk, were functional, but too unstable for biophysical studies. mutant cytochromes c ks, kt, yh and yk were purified and characterized. the yk mutant is the only one that exhibits a significant increase of + mv in redox potential compared with the wild type protein while still supporting oxidative phosphorylation in vivo. low temperature difference spectroscopy confirmed the formation of the holoprotein, while adsorption and cd spectroscopy reveal perturbations in the structure of yk iso cytochrome c.
