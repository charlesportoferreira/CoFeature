change in charge of an unvaried heme contact residue does not cause a major change of conformation in cytochrome c.. . the structure of the ala variant of yeast iso cytochrome c, in which the previously unchanged arg has been replaced, has been characterised by nmr. the nmr data indicate that the structure of the ala variant is very similar to that of the wild type protein. in particular, the heme environment and interactions of the heme macrocycle are shown to be preserved. analysis of the chemical shift perturbations to the resonances of ile is shown to be consistent with the change in charge at position . the only significant area of conformational change detected was at residues and , close to the site of modification. therefore the redox potential change accompanying the modification [, biochemistry , ] appears to be a direct consequence of the altered side chain of residue and not a result of secondary conformational changes induced by the modification.
