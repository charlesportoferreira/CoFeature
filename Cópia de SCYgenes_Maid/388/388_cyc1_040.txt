multiple copies of mrg suppress transcription of the gal promoter in a gal dependent manner in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a plasmid clone that suppresses galactose toxicity in a gal yeast strain has been isolated from a multicopy genomic dna library. molecular analysis revealed that the region responsible for the suppression of galactose toxicity corresponds to the orf yprw, which was named mrg. a cen based plasmid carrying the above orf was unable to suppress the toxicity. galactokinase activity was substantially reduced in cell extracts obtained from transformants bearing multiple copies of mrg. multiple copies of mrg were also able to suppress galactokinase expression driven by the cyc promoter but not the tef promoter. multiple copies of mrg could not suppress gal driven galactokinase expression in a gal strain. however, mrg mediated suppression of cyc driven galactokinase expression was independent of gal function. these results imply that multiple copies of mrg suppress galactokinase expression probably at the level of transcription. in agreement with this idea, multiple copies of mrg also suppress beta galactosidase expression driven by the gal promoter in a gal dependent manner. disruption of mrg leads to an increase in the cell density at stationary phase in synthetic complete medium. mrg encodes a previously uncharacterised kda protein that shows no sequence homology to any known proteins.
