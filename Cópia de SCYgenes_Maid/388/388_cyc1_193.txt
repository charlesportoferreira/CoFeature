the role of the internal hydrogen bond network in first order protein electron transfer between saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c and bovine microsomal cytochrome b.. . an internal water molecule (designated wat) is found in iso cytochrome c which is part of a redox state dependent hydrogen bond network. the position of this water molecule with respect to the polypeptide fold can be altered or even displaced by site directed mutagenesis leading to structural perturbations and associated changes in redox potential. using saturation transfer h nmr methods, this study measures changes in the electron transfer reactivity for three variants of yeast iso cytochromes c in which the position of this water molecule is altered. in particular, the reverse electron transfer rate is measured within a complex formed between either wild type or variant yeast iso cytochromes c and the tryptic fragment of bovine liver microsomal cytochrome b. for three variants of yeast iso cytochrome c the rate constants measured by saturation transfer are wild type (asn, e = mv, kex = . s ), asn ala (e = mv, kex = . s ), asn ile (e = mv, kex = . s ). the first order rates are compared with that of a fourth variant phe gly which has been measured previously (e = mv, kex = . s ). an analysis of the variation in the observed cross exchange rate using marcus theory shows that these changes can be predicted quantitatively by the shift in redox potential that accompanies mutagenesis. so, although the perturbation of the internal water molecule by mutagenesis alters both the structure and redox potential of cytochrome c, surprisingly it does not significantly influence the intrinsic electron transfer reactivity of the protein. studies of the activation parameters suggests that a variation of temperature changes both delta g* and also the prefactor. these data are discussed in terms of models involving dynamic molecular recognition between proteins.
