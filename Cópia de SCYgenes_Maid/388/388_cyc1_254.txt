a single saccharomyces cerevisiae upstream activation site (uas) has two distinct regions essential for its activity.. . several site directed mutagenesis regimens were used to generate single and multiple base substitutions in the upstream activation site uas of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cyc gene. mutations resulting in large reductions in activity of the site lie in two distinct regions. six single base changes in a region a, between and , all resulted in a fold reduction in activity. synthetic sites built up solely of multimers of the to sequence accga behaved as carbon catabolite sensitive uass. in addition, substitution mutations in a second region, at nucleotides and , virtually eliminated uas activity. these mutations abolished the binding of a heme dependent protein factor in vitro. thus, uas contains two essential regions both of which are required for its activity.
