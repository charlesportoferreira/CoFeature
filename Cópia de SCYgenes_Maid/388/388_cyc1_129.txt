electron transfer in cytochrome c depends upon the structure of the intervening medium.. . background. long distance electron transfer (et) reactions through proteins are involved in a great many biochemical processes; however, the way in which the protein structure influences the rates of these reactions is not well understood. we have therefore measured the rates of intramolecular et from the ferroheme to a bis(,' bipyridine)imidazoleruthenium(iii) acceptor at histidine or in derivatives of yeast iso cytochrome c, and studied the effect of an asparagine to isoleucine mutation at position , a residue situated between the heme and the electron acceptor. results. the fe+ &gt;ru+ rate constants demonstrate that residue affects et from the heme to his (ile &gt; asn), but not to his (ile = asn). the enhanced fe(+) ru+(his) electronic coupling for the ni/kh protein is in good agreement with sigma tunneling calculations, which predict the length of the et pathways between the heme and his. conclusion. the structure of the intervening medium between the heme and electron acceptors at the protein surface influences the donor acceptor couplings in cytochrome c.
