cis and trans acting suppressors of a translation initiation defect at the cyc locus of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cyc mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae is deficient in iso cytochrome c as a consequence of an aberrant atg codon that initiates a short open reading frame (uorf) in the cyc transcribed leader region. we have isolated and characterized functional revertants of cyc in an effort to define cis and trans acting factors that can suppress the effect of the uorf. genetic and dna sequence analyses have defined three classes of revertants. (i) those that acquired point mutations in the upstream atg (uatg), restoring iso cytochrome c to its normal level; (ii) substitution of the normal a residue at position relative to the uatg by either c or t, enhancing iso cytochrome c production from approximately % to % (c) or % (t) of normal, indicating that the nucleotide immediately preceding the initiator codon can affect the efficiency of aug start codon recognition and that purines are preferred over pyrimidines at this site; and (iii) extragenic suppressors that enhance iso cytochrome c expression to % of normal while retaining the uatg. these suppressors are represented by five different genes, designated sua sua and sua. in contrast to the previously described sua and sua suppressors, they do not compensate for the uatg by affecting cyc transcription start site selection. potential suppressor mechanisms are discussed.
