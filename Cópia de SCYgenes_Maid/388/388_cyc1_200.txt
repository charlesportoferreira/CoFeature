nucleotide sequence of the cor region. a cluster of six genes in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have determined the nucleotide (nt) sequence of the . kb cor segment that encompasses a cluster of six genes (cyc, utr, utr, osm, trna(gly) and rad) located on chromosome x of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. this sequence revealed five open reading frames and a trna gene which correspond in position, size and orientation to the transcripts previously identified by barry et al. [mol. cell. biol. () ]. the extensively studied cyc gene encodes iso cytochrome c; the utr and utr genes encode dispensible proteins whose functions are unknown; the osm gene encodes a protein required for growth on hypertonic media; the trna(gly) gene encodes a glycine trna; and the rad gene encodes a protein required for repair of uv induced damage. the osm protein contains a signal sequence for secretion and a region similar to gtp binding domains. the rad protein displays ' untranslated elements similar to those of the stress inducible gene ub. the nt sequence upstream from the trna(gly) gene contains a diverged copy of the sigma repeated element. this cluster of cor genes appears to have an ancestral relationship with the cluster of arc genes on chromosome v.
