cyp (hap) regulator of oxygen dependent gene expression in yeast. ii. missense mutation suggests alternative zn fingers as discriminating agents of gene control.. . in the accompanying paper, we present and analyse the sequence of a &quot;superactivator&quot; mutant allele of the cyp (hap) gene. this locus encodes a trans acting pleiotropic positive regulator of the transcription of both isocytochrome c structural genes. in this paper, we present the genetic localization of the mutation and the sequence of the wild type fragment that includes the mutation. the mutated phenotype that commutes the expression of the two isocytochrome structural genes (superactivation of cyp and inhibition of cyc) results from a transversion in an agt codon (serine) in the wild type to an agg codon (arginine) in the mutant. moreover, we show that the missense mutation that affects the amino acid preceding the first cysteine of the &quot;zn finger&quot; is responsible on its own account for the entire mutated phenotype. in all seven yeast regulatory proteins analysed so far, this position is occupied by a neutral amino acid (serine, alanine or glycine), thus the serine arginine replacement is a radical one. this result is consistent with the hypothesis of alternative and mutually exclusive zn fingers, formed either at low or high redox potential, recognizing the target sequences identified in the upstream regions of the cyc and cyp isocytochrome c structural genes.
