the cloning and characterization of the cdc gene family in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have cloned a gene that complements the cold sensitive growth of cdc mutant strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae at degrees c. the cdc gene was found to be identical to ycrw on chromosome iii and contains nucleotides encoding amino acids. we found a missense mutation at the first initiation codon of cdc . the disruption of the cdc gene revealed that it is not essential for growth, but the disruptant caused the same cold sensitive phenotype as cdc , suggesting that the cdc is a null mutation resulted from the mutation in the first codon. the cdc mutant arrests at start in g phase at the non permissive temperature. the cdc gene product has strong structural similarity to two other proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae encoded by ynrw and ynlw. the over expression of either ynrw or ynlw suppressed the cdc mutant and the double disruption of either cdc and ynrw or cdc and ynlw resulted in a severe slow growth phenotype. we conclude that these three genes constitute a family with redundant function. we also found that the cdc gene was a multicopy suppressor of cdc mutation, suggesting that the cdc family is involved in regulation of transcription via cdc.
