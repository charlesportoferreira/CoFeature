mutational analysis of upstream activation sequence of the cyc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. a hap hap responsive site.. . we analyzed upstream activation sequence (uas), one of two independent uas elements in the cyc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. deletions and linker scanning mutations across the base pairs previously defined as uas showed two separate functional elements required for full activity. region , from to , contains the principal activation site and responds to the trans acting regulatory loci hap and hap. a portion of region is homologous to two other hap hap responsive uass and includes the g a transition mutation up, which increases uas activity. this consensus sequence tnattggt bears striking similarity to several caat box sequences of higher cells. region , from to , substantially enhances the activity of region , yet has little activity by itself. these regions bind distinct proteins found in crudely fractionated yeast extracts.
