spectroscopic properties of a mitochondrial cytochrome c with a single thioether bond to the heme prosthetic group.. . the yeast iso cytochrome c variant cysser has been prepared in which one of the two thioether bonds by which the heme prosthetic group is normally bound to the protein has been eliminated. comparison of the properties of this variant with those of the wild type cytochrome provides insight into the role of this covalent attachment of the heme group to the apo protein toward the functional properties of the wild type cytochrome. although nmr and epr spectra indicate that the cysser variant ferricytochrome adopts the native conformation characteristic of the wild type protein with his and met coordinated to the heme iron (met epsilon ch . ppm; g(z), g(y), g(x), at ., ., approximately ., respectively), the electronic spectrum of the variant does not exhibit the nm ct band that is characteristic of native ferricytochromes c with these axial ligands. chromatographic and spectropolarimetric comparison of the variant and wild type ferricytochromes suggests that the structure of the variant is more disordered, particularly in the region of the sole tryptophanyl residue (trp). upon reduction, the electronic spectrum of the variant exhibits a symmetrically broadened alpha band that is shifted approximately nm to the ultraviolet relative to its position in the spectrum in the wild type protein. in the mcd spectrum, a band appears above nm that is more intense than the soret a term which is also shifted to lower energy.
