rlr (tho), required for expressing lacz fusions in yeast, is conserved from yeast to humans and is a suppressor of sin.. . we isolated a mutation (rlr ; required for lacz rna) in the saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc) rlr gene as a suppressor of sin, a component of the mediator subcomplex of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme and a determinant of chromatin structure. rlr encodes a deduced protein found also in fission yeast, nematode worms, and humans. the presence of these orthologs suggests that rlr family members comprise a class of putative keke motif containing proteins, characteristic of certain chaperones as well as regulators and subunits of the mammalian s proteasome. a role for rlr (tho) in transcription appears to occur at a step subsequent to transcription initiation (see also piruat, j.i. and aguilera, a., . embo j. , ); sc genes fused to the reporter gene lacz were expressed at a very low level, while the corresponding native chromosomal genes were expressed at approximately normal levels in rlr mutants. our studies show that rlr mutations cause a wide range of growth defects in addition to their novel affect on lacz.
