rna polymerase ii and tbp occupy the repressed cyc promoter.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae cyc gene expression has been studied in great detail with regard to the response to oxygen availability and carbon source. in the absence of oxygen and the presence of glucose, the cyc gene is completely repressed. chromatin structure is thought to play an important role in cyc gene regulation, as nucleosome depletion results in fold derepression. in addition, the cyc core promoter has been used extensively in hybrid constructs to study activation by heterologous transcription factors. therefore, we set out to map the chromatin structure of the cyc promoter and determine its role in cyc gene regulation. we report here that the repressed cyc promoter contains no positioned nucleosomes over the core promoter. however, we did find tfiid and rna polymerase ii bound in a complex on the repressed promoter. these results indicate that recruitment of tfiid and rna polymerase ii are not rate limiting steps in cyc activation.
