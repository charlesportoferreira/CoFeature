proton titration curve of yeast iso ferricytochrome c. electrostatic and conformational effects of point mutations.. . the proton titration curves of yeast iso ferricytochrome c and selected point mutants of this protein have been determined between ph and at and degrees c with a computer controlled titration system. initial titration of the wild type protein to acidic ph followed by subsequent titrations to alkaline and then acidic ph demonstrates hysteresis, with one more group (.) titrating between ph and than originally titrated (.) between ph and . initial titration to alkaline ph, however, resulted in observation of the same number of groups in both directions of titration (. vs .). at degrees c, . fewer groups were found to titrate over the same range of ph. titration curves obtained for six cytochrome c mutants modified at arg , phe , tyr , and tyr were analyzed by subtraction of the corresponding titration curve for the wild type protein to produce difference titration curves. in most cases, the effects of these mutations as revealed in the difference titration curves could be accounted for as either the result of introduction of an additional group titrating within this ph range, the result of a change in the pk of a titrating residue, and/or the result of a change in the pk for either the first acidic or the first alkaline protein conformational transition. in addition to demonstration of the electrostatic consequences of the mutations in cytochrome c studied here, this study establishes the general usefulness of precise proton titration curve analysis in the characterization of variant proteins produced through recombinant genetic techniques.
