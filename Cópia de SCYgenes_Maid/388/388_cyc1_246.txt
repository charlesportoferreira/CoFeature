yeast hap activator binds to two upstream activation sites of different sequence.. . we show that the hap protein binds in vitro to the upstream activation site (uas) of the yeast cyc gene. strikingly, this sequence bears no obvious similarity to the sequence bound by hap at uas of the cyc gene. the cyc and cyc sites compete for binding to hap and have comparable affinities for the protein. the gross features of the interaction of hap with the two sites are similar. multiple major and minor groove contacts, spanning bp, on one helical face, with a back side major groove contact toward one end. the precise positions of the contacts differ, however. a mutant form of hap, hap , abolishes the ability of the protein to bind to uas but not cyc dna. possible mechanisms for how a single protein recognizes two sequences are discussed.
