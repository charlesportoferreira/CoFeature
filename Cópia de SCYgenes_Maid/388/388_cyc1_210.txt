expression and activity of a gene encoding rat cytochrome c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a rat processed pseudogene, which encodes normal rat cytochrome c, has been expressed in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae. the translated region of the chromosomal cyc+ locus, which encodes yeast iso cytochrome c, was replaced by the translated region of the gene encoding rat cytochrome c (cyc rat), thus preserving the proper cyc transcription initiation and termination signals. although the levels of transcription of the normal cyc+ gene and the cyc rat gene in yeast were equivalent, rat cytochrome c was produced at approx. % of the level of iso cytochrome c. in addition, the specific activity in vivo was estimated to be approx. % that of the yeast iso cytochrome c. n terminal processing of indigenous rat cytochrome c, in which the n terminal methionine residue is cleaved and the penultimate glycine residue is acetylated, also occurred in yeast. methionine cleavage was complete, while acetylation proceeded to only % completion. lys was trimethylated to % completion in the rat cytochrome c produced in yeast. the near normal expression (%) and specific activity (%) in vivo indicates that the % difference in amino acid sequence is not critical for mitochondrial import, heme attachment and interactions with redox partners.
