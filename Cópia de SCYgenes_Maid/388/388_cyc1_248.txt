yeast hap and hap activators both bind to the cyc upstream activation site, uas, in an interdependent manner.. . transcriptional activation by the yeast cyc upstream activation site uasup requires the products of both the hap and hap regulatory genes. we show here that both hap and hap in yeast extracts bind to uasup and give rise to a single protein dna complex, termed c, in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. that both products are a part of complex c was shown by altering the mobility of the complex by fusing either hap or hap to beta galactosidase. further, methylation interference footprinting showed that sequences in uasup contacted in complex c were identical to those contacted in either fusion protein complex. binding was centered on the sequence tgattggt, also found in the uass of other genes subject to activation by the hap hap system and homologous to the ccaat box sequence found in higher cells. the binding of either hap or hap was abolished when synthesized in a strain mutant in the complementary hap gene. thus the binding of hap and hap to uasup is interdependent. the involvement of multiple gene products in binding to a single site is discussed with reference to other systems in yeast and higher cells.
