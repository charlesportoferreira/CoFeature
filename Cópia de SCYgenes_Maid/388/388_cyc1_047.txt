antibody immunodiversity. a study on the marked specificity difference between two anti yeast iso cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies whose epitopes are closely related.. . anti yeast iso cytochrome c (cyt. c) monoclonal antibodies and have closely related epitopes (antigenic determinants). however, while the specificity of is stringent, cross reacts with many evolutionarily related cytochromes c. such a marked difference in specificity of antibodies with overlapping epitopes may represent unique antibody immunodiversity. thus, we constructed fv fragment models consisting of the variable domains of the heavy and light chains of and and that of another anti iso cyt. c as a control to gain insight into the origin of this difference in specificity. our models show that and contain five and two aromatic side chains, respectively, in or near the central area of the antigen combining site. the side chains of argh (heavy chain) in and argl (light chain) in project toward the central area of the combining site in our model. antigen docking to our fv models, combined with previous immunological studies, suggests that iso cyt. c asp may interact with argh in and argl in and that both epitopes of and may include iso cyt. c leu, asp, asn, and asn. the effect of the argh to lys mutation on the antigen binding is also in accord with our model. the difference in specificity may be partly explained by a greater degree of conformational flexibility in and around the central area of the combining site in compared to due to differences in aromatic side chain packing.
