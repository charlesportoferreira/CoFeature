the klcyc gene, a downstream region for two differentially regulated transcripts.. . klcyc encodes for cytochrome c in the yeast kluyveromyces lactis and is transcribed in two mrnas with different ' processing points. this is an uncommon transcription mechanism in yeast mrnas. the ' sequence encompassing the whole region that is needed to produce both mrnas is analysed. we have determined identical processing points in k.lactis and in saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with klcyc; positions and (with respect to the taa) are the major polyadenylation points. this shows that the cis elements present in the klcyc ' untranslated region (' utr) direct a processing mechanism that has been conserved in yeast. in k. lactis there is a high predominance of the shorter transcript (. kb) only at the initial logarithmic growth phase. interestingly, this growth phase dependent regulation of ' utr processing is lost when the gene is expressed in s. cerevisiae. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
