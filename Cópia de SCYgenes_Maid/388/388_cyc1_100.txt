oxidation of yeast iso ferrocytochrome c by yeast cytochrome c peroxidase compounds i and ii. dependence upon ionic strength.. . the reduction of cytochrome c peroxidase compound i by excess yeast iso ferrocytochrome c is biphasic. two pseudo first order rate constants can be measured by stopped flow techniques. the fastest rate process is the reduction of cytochrome c peroxidase compound i to compound ii, and the slower process is the reduction of ii to the native enzyme. the yeast iso ferrocytochrome c concentration dependence of the reduction of cytochrome c peroxidase compound i to compound ii is consistent with a mechanism involving two binding sites for cytochrome c on cytochrome c peroxidase. electron transfer from cytochrome c bound at the high affinity binding site to the fe(iv) site in cytochrome c peroxidase compound i is dependent upon ionic strength, increasing from +/ to +/ s over the ionic strength range . . m. the reduction rate of the fe(iv) site in the . yeast iso ferrocytochrome c/cytochrome c peroxidase compound i complex is essentially independent of ionic strength with a value of +/ s . the fe(iv) site in cytochrome c peroxidase compound i is preferentially reduced by yeast ferrocytochrome c between . and . m ionic strength while the trp radical is preferentially reduced above . m ionic strength. the association rate constant for the binding of yeast iso ferrocytochrome c to cytochrome c peroxidase compound i can be evaluated and varies from a remarkable x () m s at . m ionic strength to . x () m s at . m ionic strength. between . and . m ionic strength, the reduction of cytochrome c peroxidase compound ii to the native enzyme is anomalous. the reaction is independent of the cytochrome c concentration and directly proportional to the initial cytochrome c peroxidase compound i concentration.
