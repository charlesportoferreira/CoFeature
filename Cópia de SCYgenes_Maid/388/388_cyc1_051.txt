control of cleavage site selection during mrna ' end formation by a yeast hnrnp.. . endonucleolytic cleavage of pre mrnas is the first step during eukaryotic mrna ' end formation. it has been proposed that cleavage factors cf ia, cf ib and cf ii are required for pre mrna ' end cleavage in yeast. cf ib is composed of a single polypeptide, nabp/hrpp, which is related to the a/b group of metazoan heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnrnps) that function as antagonistic regulators of ' splice site selection. here, we provide evidence that nabp/hrpp is not required for pre mrna ' end endonucleolytic cleavage. we show that cf ia and cf ii devoid of nabp/hrpp are sufficient to cleave a variety of rna substrates but that cleavage occurs at multiple sites. addition of nabp/hrpp prevents these alternative cleavages in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting an essential and conserved role for some hnrnps in pre mrna cleavage site selection.
