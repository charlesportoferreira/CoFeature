direct voltammetric observation of redox driven changes in axial coordination and intramolecular rearrangement of the phenylalanine histidine variant of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . direct square wave and cyclic voltammetric electrochemical examination of the yeast iso cytochrome c phehis/cysser variant revealed the intricacies of redox driven changes in axial coordination, concomitant with intramolecular rearrangement. electrochemical methods are ideally suited for such a redox study, since they provide a direct and quantitative visualization of specific dynamic events. for the iso cytochrome c phehis/cysser variant, square wave voltammetry showed that the primary species in the reduced state is the met fe+ his coordination form, while in the oxidized state the his fe+ his form predominates. the addition or removal of an electron to the appropriate form of this variant serves as a switch to a new molecular form of the cytochrome. using the x electrochemical mechanism, simulations were done for the cyclic voltammetry experiments at different scan rates. these, in turn, provided relative rate constants for the intramolecular rearrangement/ligand exchange and the equilibrium redox potentials of the participating coordination forms. kb,ac = s for met fe+ his &gt; his fe+ his and kf,bd &gt; s for his fe+ his &gt; met fe+ his; e' = mv for met fe+/+ his couple, e' = mv for his fe+/+ his couple, and e' = mv for the cross reaction couple, his fe+ his + e &gt; met fe+ his. thermodynamic parameters, including the entropy of reaction, deltas'rxn, were determined for the net reduction/rearrangement reaction, his fe+ his + e &gt; met fe+ his, and compared to those for wild type cytochrome, met fe+ his + e &gt; met fe+ his. for the phehis variant mixed redox couple, deltas'rxn = j/mol.k compared to deltas'rxn = j/mol.k for the wild type cyt c couple without rearrangement. comparison of these entropies indicates that the oxidized his fe+ his form is highly disordered. it is proposed that this high level of disorder facilitates rapid rearrangement to met fe+ his upon reduction.
