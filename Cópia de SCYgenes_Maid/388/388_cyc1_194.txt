enhanced thermodynamic stabilities of yeast iso cytochromes c with amino acid replacements at positions and .. . we have determined the structures and thermodynamic stabilities of the wild type asn and unusually thermostable mutant ile yeast iso cytochromes c (das, g., hickey, d. r. mclendon, d., mclendon, g., and sherman, f. () proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. , ). although both structures were similar, water , buried within the wild type protein, is excluded from the ile mutant, which substantially reorganizes the local hydrogen bonding. wild type cys was replaced with alanine or serine to eliminate dimerization in vitro. the cys (wild type), ala , and ser proteins were equally stable, whereas the chemically modified cys sch was less stable. the order of stability observed with replacements at positions and was as follows. ile ala greater than ala ala greater than asn ala (&quot;normal&quot;) greater than gly ala . no significant stabilization was attributed to potential energy interactions expressed as helix forming propensities of replacements at position . a high correlation between differences in free energy changes and transfer free energies suggests hydrophobic interactions are the main factor for enhancing stability in the ile mutant. additional possible contributions to the thermostability of the ile variant are energetic effects due to packing and hydrogen bonding changes surrounding position .
