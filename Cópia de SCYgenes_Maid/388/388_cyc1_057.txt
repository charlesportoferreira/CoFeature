degradation of yeast cytochromes c dependent and independent on its physiological partners.. . altered iso and iso cytochromes c, with certain amino acid replacements, occur at diminished levels due to degradation in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. a subclass of the labile isocytochromes c are significantly protected from degradation by the presence of cytochromes a.a and c, the physiological partners of cytochrome c. we have investigated the degradation that is dependent on physiological partners by examining the levels of iso cytochrome c having all or most amino acid replacements at positions , , , and , in both rho+ strains and rho strains, which lacks cytochrome a.a. in addition, we have examined some of these replacements in strains also having the ni replacement, which suppresses a variety of abnormal iso cytochromes c, including those whose degradation is either dependent or independent on the physiological partners. although some degree of preferential rho dependent reductions was observed for iso cytochromes c having replacements at each of the , , , and sites, prominent effects of rho+/rho ratios of approximately / to / were observed for iso cytochromes c having replacements mainly at the , , and sites, but not the g site. we suggest that prominent degradation dependent on physiological partners may be restricted to certain regions of the cytochrome c molecule. furthermore, we suggest that the region of the largest confirmational difference between oxidized and reduced cytochrome c appears to be particularly protected by interactions with its physiological partners. copyright academic press.
