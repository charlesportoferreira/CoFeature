rna polymerase ii subunit rpb is required for accurate start site selection.. . the diverse functions of saccharomyces cerevisiae rna polymerase ii are partitioned among its subunits, designated rpb rpb. although multiple functions have been assigned to the three largest subunits, rpb, rpb, and rpb, the functions of the remaining smaller subunits are unknown. we have determined the function of one of the smaller subunits, rpb, by demonstrating that it is necessary for accurate start site selection. transcription in the absence of rpb initiates farther upstream at new and previously minor start sites both at the cyc promoter in vitro and at the cyc, adh, his, hb , and rpb promoters in vivo. immunoprecipitation of rna polymerase ii from cells lacking the rpb gene revealed that all of the remaining subunits are assembled into the enzyme, suggesting that the start site defect is attributable solely to the absence of rpb. in support of this hypothesis, we have shown that addition of wild type recombinant rpb completely corrects for the start site defect seen in vitro. a mutated recombinant rpb protein, with an alteration in a metal binding domain required for high temperature growth and accurate start site selection in vivo, was at least fold less effective at correcting the start site defect in vitro. rpb appears to play a unique role in transcription initiation, as the defects revealed in its absence are distinct from those seen with mutants in rna polymerase subunit rpb and factor e (tfiib), two other yeast proteins also involved in start site selection.
