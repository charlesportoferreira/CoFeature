genetic analysis of the role of pol ii holoenzyme components in repression by the cyc tup corepressor in yeast.. . the cyc tup corepressor complex is targeted to promoters by pathway specific dna binding repressors, thereby inhibiting the transcription of specific classes of genes. genetic screens have identified mutations in a variety of pol ii holoenzyme components (srb, srb, srb, srb, sin, rgr, rox, and hrs) and in the n terminal tails of histones h and h that weaken repression by cyc tup. here, we analyze the effect of individual and multiple mutations in many of these components on transcriptional repression of natural promoters that are regulated by cyc tup. in all cases tested, individual mutations have a very modest effect on suc rna levels and no detectable effect on levels of anb, mfa, and rnr. furthermore, multiple mutations within the srb components, between srbs and sin, and between srbs and histone tails affect cyc tup repression to the same modest extent as the individual mutations. these results argue that the weak effects of the various mutations on repression by cyc tup are not due to redundancy among components of the pol ii machinery, and they argue against a simple redundancy between the holoenzyme and chromatin pathways. in addition, phenotypic analysis indicates that, although srbs are indistinguishable with respect to cyc tup repression, the individual srbs are functionally distinct in other respects. genetic interactions among srb mutations imply that a balance between the activities of srb + srb and srb is important for normal cell growth.
