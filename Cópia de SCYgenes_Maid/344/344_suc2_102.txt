genealogy of principal strains of the yeast genetic stock center.. . we have constructed a genealogy of strain sc, from which many of the mutant and segregant strains currently used in studies on the genetics and molecular biology of saccharomyces cerevisiae have been derived. we have determined that its six progenitor strains were em, em, nrrl yb and the three baking strains yeast foam, fld and lk. we have estimated that approximately % of the gene pool of sc is contributed by strain em. the principal ancestral genotypes were those of segregant strains em c and em b, initially distributed by c. c. lindegren to several laboratories. we have analyzed an isolate of lyophilized culture of strain em and determined its genotype as mata/mat alpha suc/suc gal/gal mal/mal mel/mel cup/cup flo/flo. strain em is therefore the probable origin of genes suc, gal, cup and flo of sc. we give details of the current availability of several of the progenitor strains and propose that this genealogy should be of assistance in elucidating the origins of several types of genetic and molecular heterogeneities in saccharomyces.
