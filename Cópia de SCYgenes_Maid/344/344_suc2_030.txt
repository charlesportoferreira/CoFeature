the nucleosome remodeling complex, snf/swi, is required for the maintenance of transcription in vivo and is partially redundant with the histone acetyltransferase, gcn.. . snf/swi, a nucleosome remodeling complex, is important for overcoming nucleosome mediated repression of transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we have addressed the mechanism by which snf/swi controls transcription in vivo of an snf/swi dependent promoter, that of the suc gene. by single cell analysis, our results show that snf/swi is required for activated levels of suc expression in every cell of a population. in addition, snf/swi is required for maintenance of suc transcription, suggesting that continuous chromatin remodeling is necessary to maintain an active transcriptional state. finally, snf/swi and gcn, a histone acetyltransferase, have partially redundant roles in the control of suc transcription, suggesting a functional overlap between two different mechanisms believed to overcome repression by nucleosomes, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetylation.
