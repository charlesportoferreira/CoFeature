analysis of the sip protein identified in a two hybrid screen for interaction with the snf protein kinase.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae sip gene was identified in a two hybrid screen for proteins that interact in vivo with the snf protein kinase, which is necessary for release of glucose repression. we showed that the c terminal part of sip, recovered through its ability to interact with snf, strongly activates transcription when tethered to dna. we have cloned and sequenced the entire sip gene. the predicted kd sip protein contains a putative leucine zipper motif located in its c terminus. the native sip protein also interacts with dna bound snf and activates transcription of a target gene. a complete deletion of the sip gene did not confer phenotypes characteristic of snf mutants. however, in a mutant deficient for the snf kinase activity due to loss of the snf stimulatory function, increased dosage of sip partially restored expression of the glucose repressible suc gene. overexpression of the c terminus of sip caused defects in growth and suc expression which were remedied by overexpressing snf. taken together, these genetic data suggest that sip is functionally related to the snf protein kinase pathway.
