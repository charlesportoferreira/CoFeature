mutants of yeast defective in sucrose utilization.. . utilization of sucrose as a source of carbon and energy in yeast (saccharomyces) is controlled by the classical suc genes, which confer the ability to produce the sucrose degrading enzyme invertase (mortimer and hawthorne ). mutants of s. cerevisiae strain sc (suc+) unable to grow anaerobically on sucrose, but still able to use glucose, were isolated. two major complementation groups were identified. twenty four recessive mutations at the suc locus (suc ); and five recessive mutations defining a new locus, snf (for sucrose nonfermenting), essential for sucrose utilization. two minor complementation groups, each comprising a single member with a leaky sucrose nonfermenting phenotype, were also identified. the suc mutations isolated include four suppressible amber mutations and five mutations apparently exhibiting intragenic complementation; complementation analysis and mitotic mapping studies indicated that all of the suc mutations are alleles of a single gene. these results suggest that suc encodes a protein, probably a dimer or multimer. no invertase activity was detected in suc probably a dimer or multimer. no invertase activity was detected in suc mutants, the snf locus is not tightly linked to suc. the snf mutations were found to be pleiotropic, preventing sucrose utilization by suc+ and suc+ strains, and also preventing utilization of galactose, maltose and several nonfermentable carbon sources. although snf mutants thus display a petite phenotype, classic petite mutations do not interfere with utilization of sucrose, galactose or maltose. a common feature of all the carbon utilization systems affected by snf is that all are regulated by glucose repression. the snf mutants were found to produce the constitutive nonglycosylated form of invertase, but failed to produce the glucose repressible, glycosylated, secreted invertase. this failure cannot be attributed to a general defect in production of glycosylated and secreted proteins because synthesis of acid phosphatase, a glycosylated secreted protein not subject to glucose repression, was not affected by snf mutations. these findings suggest that the snf locus is involved in the regulation of gene expression by glucose repression.
