structural analysis of the ' regions of yeast suc genes revealed analogous palindromes in suc, mal and gal.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae six unlinked structural genes for invertase, the suc genes, are known. we sequenced about bp of the ' non coding region and the first bp of the coding region of the genes suc, suc, suc and suc and compared them with the previously sequenced genes suc and suc (sarokin and carlson a). all are highly homologous within the coding region but in the non coding region suc shows some differences and suc is more highly diverged. two different kinds of tata boxes were identified. the more strongly expressed genes suc, and have the sequence tataaa and the more weakly expressed genes suc, and have tacaaa. though the suc sequence is in general more homologous to the other suc genes, the region between and + of suc is nearly identical to suc. this could be due to a gene conversion between suc and the silent suc degrees allele which occurs in the strains carrying suc. within the upstream regions of all the suc genes three regions with palindromic sequences analogous to stem and loop structures were identified. comparable structures could be detected in similar positions in the upstream sequences of the divergently transcribed yeast gene pairs mals malt and gal gal. implications for the importance of these structures in the regulation and initiation of transcription are discussed.
