fine analysis of the chromatin structure of the yeast suc gene and of its changes upon derepression. comparison between the chromosomal and plasmid inserted genes.. . micrococcal nuclease digestion has been used to investigate some fine details of the chromatin structure of the yeast suc gene for invertase. precisely positioned nucleosomes have been found on a kb sequence from the ' non coding region, and four nucleosomes also seem to occupy fixed positions on the ' flank. eleven nucleosomes lie on the coding region, although their positioning is not as precise as in the flanks. when the gene is derepressed, these latter nucleosomes adopt a more open conformation and so do two of the nucleosomes positioned on the ' flank. a dramatic change occurs in the ' flank, whose involvement in the structural transitions of chromatin upon gene activation is postulated. all the observed features are conserved when the gene is inserted in either a single copy centromeric plasmid or in a multicopy, micron circle based plasmid.
