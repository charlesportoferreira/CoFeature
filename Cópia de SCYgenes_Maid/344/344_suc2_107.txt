suppressors of snf mutations restore invertase derepression and cause temperature sensitive lethality in yeast.. . mutations in the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae prevent derepression of the suc (invertase) gene, and other glucose repressible genes, in response to glucose deprivation. we have isolated partial phenotypic revertants of a snf mutant that are able to derepress secreted invertase. these revertants all carried suppressor mutations at a single locus, designated ssn (suppressor of snf). alleles with dominant, partially dominant and recessive suppressor phenotypes were recovered, but all were only partial suppressors of snf, reversing the defect in invertase synthesis but not other defects. all alleles also caused recessive, temperature sensitive lethality and a recessive defect in galactose utilization, regardless of the snf genotype. no significant effect on suc expression was detected in a wild type (snf) genetic background. the ssn mutations also suppressed the defects in invertase derepression caused by snf and snf mutations, and selection for invertase producing revertants of snf mutants yielded only additional ssn alleles. these findings suggest that the roles of the snf, snf and snf genes in regulation of suc are functionally related and that ssn plays a role in expression of a variety of yeast genes.
