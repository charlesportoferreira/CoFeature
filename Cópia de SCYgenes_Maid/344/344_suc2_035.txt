isolation and characterization of an invertase and its repressor genes from schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . pcr was used to isolate an invertase homolog gene from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. the cloned inv(+) gene encodes a protein of amino acids with potential asparagine linked glycosylation sites, and has % and % identity to the schwanniomyces occidentalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae suc invertases. when the inv(+) gene was disrupted, s. pombe strains lacked detectable invertase activity. this result showed that the inv(+) gene encodes only one active invertase in s. pombe cells. the transcription of inv(+) is repressed in the presence of glucose. the transcription of inv(+) was not affected in cyrdelta strain which lacks adenylate cyclase activity, unlike transcription of s. pombe fbp(+) gene. we have identified an s. pombe gene (scr(+)) that encodes a homolog of the aspergillus nidulans crea which is required for glucose repression of the glyconeogenic pathway. although the deletion of scr(+) did not influence the transcription of fbp(+) gene, glucose repression of the inv(+) gene was severely affected. these results showed that glucose repression of inv(+) gene is dependent on scr(+) gene, and s. pombe camp signalling pathway may not be essential for glucose repression of inv(+) gene. copyright academic press.
