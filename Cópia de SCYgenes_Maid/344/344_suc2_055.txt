molecular analysis of the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mutations in the snf gene impair derepression of the suc gene, encoding invertase, in response to glucose limitation of saccharomyces cerevisiae. we report here the cloning of the snf gene by complementation. sequence analysis predicts a , dalton product. disruption of the chromosomal locus caused a five fold decrease in invertase derepression, defective growth on raffinose, and a sporulation defect in homozygous diploids. genetic analysis of the interactions of the snf null mutation with spt/ssn and ssn suppressors distinguished snf from the groups, snf, snf and snf, snf, snf. notably, the snf ssn double mutants were extremely sick. mutations of snf and snf showed similar phenotypes and genetic interactions, and the double mutant combination caused no additional phenotypic impairment. these findings suggest that snf and snf are functionally related.
