characterization of tup, a mediator of glucose repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the tup and cyc (= ssn) genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae play a major role in glucose repression. mutations in either tup or cyc eliminate or reduce glucose repression of many repressible genes and induce other phenotypes, including flocculence, failure to sporulate, and sterility of mat alpha cells. the tup gene was isolated in a screen for genes that regulate mating type (v.l. mackay, methods enzymol. . , ). we found that a . kb restriction fragment was sufficient for complete complementation of tup . the gene was further localized by insertional mutagenesis and rna mapping. sequence analysis of . kb of dna including tup revealed only one long open reading frame which predicts a protein of molecular weight ,. the predicted protein is rich in serine, threonine, and glutamine. in the carboxyl region there are six repeats of a pattern of about amino acids. this same pattern of conserved residues is seen in the beta subunit of transducin and the yeast cdc gene product. insertion and deletion mutants are viable, with the same range of phenotypes as for point mutants. deletions of the ' end of the coding region produced the same mutant phenotypes as did total deletions, suggesting that the c terminus is critical for tup function. strains with deletions in both the cyc and tup genes are viable, with phenotypes similar to those of strains with a single deletion. a deletion mutation of tup was able to suppress the snf mutation block on expression of the suc gene encoding invertase.
