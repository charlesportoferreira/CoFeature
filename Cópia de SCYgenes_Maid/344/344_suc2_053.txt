regulation of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . selection for mutants which release glucose repression of the cyb gene was used to identify genes which regulate repression of mitochondrial biogenesis. we have identified two of these as the previously described grr/cat and rox genes. mutations in these genes not only release glucose repression of cyb but also generally release respiration of the mutants from glucose repression. in addition, both mutants are partially defective in cyb expression when grown on nonfermentable carbon sources, indicating a positive regulatory role as well. rox was cloned by complementation of a glucose inducible flocculating phenotype of an amber mutant and has been mapped as a new leftmost marker on chromosome . the rox mutant has only a modest defect in glucose repression of gal but is substantially compromised in galactose induction of gal expression. this mutant also has increased suc expression on nonrepressing carbon sources. we have also characterized the regulation of cyb in strains carrying null mutation in two other glucose repression genes, hxk and ssn, and show that hxk is a negative regulator of cyb, whereas ssn appears to be a positive effector of cyb expression.
