hypoglycosylation in the algdelta yeast mutant destabilizes protease a and causes proteolytic loss of external invertase.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae algdelta mutant accumulates oligosaccharide lipid with a man()glcnac() oligosaccharide. to determine the n glycan structures present on s. cerevisiae glycoproteins in the algdelta strain, we made attempts to purify external invertase, a highly glycosylated secreted protein. these efforts revealed that, in the algdelta background, external invertase was mildly hypoglycosylated and rapidly destroyed proteolytically. although secreted algdelta invertase was more severely hypoglycosylated than the algdelta form, it was paradoxically stable during purification. the loss of periplasmic invertase was prevented by addition of pepstatin a to the cell cultures, suggesting that aspartyl proteases were active. we found that during overexpression of invertase in algdelta yeast, sufficient protease a was mistargeted to the periplasmic space, where it hydrolyzed the invertase. even though algdelta invertase is underglycosylated in comparison to the algdelta form, it is more stable because in this genetic background much less protease a is secreted compared to algdelta cells. these observations may be relevant to studies using other extracellular proteins (e.g., mating factors, alpha glucosidase) as probes when characterizing glycosylation defects in yeast.
