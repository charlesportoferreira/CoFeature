srb/mediator proteins interact functionally and physically with transcriptional repressor sfl.. . srb/mediator proteins that are associated with rna polymerase ii holoenzyme have been implicated in transcriptional repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we show here that the defect in repression of suc caused by mutation of srb, srb, srb, sin or rox is suppressed by increased dosage of the sfl gene, and the genetic behavior of the sfldelta mutation provides further evidence for a functional relationship. sfl acts on suc through a repression site located immediately ' to the tata box, and sfl binds this dna sequence in vitro. moreover, lexa sfl represses transcription of a reporter, and repression is reduced in an srb mutant. finally, we show that sfl co immunoprecipitates from cell extracts with srb, srb, sin and rox. we propose that sfl, when bound to its site, interacts with srb/mediator proteins to inhibit transcription by rna polymerase ii holoenzyme.
