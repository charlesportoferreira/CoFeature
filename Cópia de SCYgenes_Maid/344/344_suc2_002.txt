sandwich hybridisation assay for quantitative detection of yeast rnas in crude cell lysates.. . background. a rapid microtiter plate based sandwich hybridization assay was developed for detection and quantification of single rna species using magnetic beads. following solution hybridization target rna molecules were collected by biotin streptavidin affinity binding and detected by fluorescence signal generated by alkaline phosphatase. the s rrna and suc mrna of saccharomyces cerevisiae were used as model rna target molecules. results. the sensitivity of the assay was approximately . x ( fmol) molecules of target rna. the developed method was feasible with crude cell lysates of s. cerevisiae carlsbergensis and was evaluated by measuring the levels of s rrna during cell growth and suc mrna under repressive and inductive conditions. the s rrna expression level followed the changes in the specific growth rate. suc mrna levels were in good correlation with the measured invertase enzyme activities. conclusions. the here presented sandwich hybridisation method was succefully applied for monitoring the amounts of ribosomal rna and mrna with high expression level in shake flask cultivation conditions. sandwich hybridisation method offers a fast and convenient tool for following single key rna species of interest in the production conditions.
