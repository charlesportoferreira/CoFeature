amino acid residues in std protein required for induction of suc transcription are also required for suppression of tbpdelta growth defect in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the std gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated independently as a multicopy suppressor of a dominant negative mutation in the tata binding protein and of a mutation in the snf/snf kinase complex, suggesting that std might couple the snf kinase signaling pathway to the transcriptional machinery. in order to identify the protein domains that specify these activities of the std protein, a plasmid library of randomly mutagenized std genes was screened for loss of function alleles using complementation of the raffinose growth defect of a std , mth strain as an assay. one missense allele (ps) with complete loss of function at degreesc and four missense alleles (lf, ek, sl and ek) that conferred a temperature sensitive phenotype were identified. the c terminal residues of std were essential for suc derepression, whereas the deletion of the n terminal residues did not affect suc gene induction. std mutants that lost the ability to induce suc, were also unable to suppress the growth defect caused by the expression of the dominant negative tbpdelta protein, suggesting that these two genetic screens may be detecting the same biological activity.
