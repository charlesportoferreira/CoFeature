effects of gal suc promoter combinations on suc gene expression in s. cerevisiae.. . the plasmid series yep delta n bearing gal suc promoter combinations were constructed by inserting suc gene with different upstream deletions downstream gal promoter on yep. after transforming yeast cells s. cerevisiae, the invertases expressed by each of the transformants were measured and analysed by means of page. the results showed that. ) the suc gene with upstream deletion to at bp expressed high level glycosylated form of invertase under glucose derepression, while suc gene with more extensive deletions to bp or more lost its response to glucose derepression; ) each part of gal suc promoter combination acted almost independently. all of the combinations showed no apparent coordinated promoter function under our experimental conditions; ) sequences between bp and bp of suc upstream region are responsible for constitutive expression of nonglycosylated invertase. the two tracts of poly (da dt) of this region may serve as promoter elements.
