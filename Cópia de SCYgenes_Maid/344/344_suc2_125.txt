distinct repressible mrnas for cytoplasmic and secreted yeast invertase are encoded by a single gene.. . we have studied regulation of invertase putative structural genes (suc) in s. cerevisiae and the synthetic relationship between secreted, glycosylated invertase (e.c....) and the cytoplasmic, nonglycosylated form of the enzyme. using immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis, we have analyzed invertase polypeptides and glycopeptides synthesized in vitro and in vivo. analysis of size fractionated mrna from a suc strain has shown that three mature, catabolite repressible mrna species direct the in vitro synthesis of three invertase polypeptides that have differing molecular weights. two of these polypeptides, p and p ( and kd), are larger than the polypeptides of the secreted enzyme and are cotranslationally processed by microsomal membranes in vitro to yield secreted invertase glycopeptides (gp and gp). the smallest polypeptide, p ( kd), which comigrates electrophoretically with cytoplasmic invertase, is not processed. posttranslationally, a microsomal membrane detergent extract removes approximately aminoacids from p but not from p. in vitro translations of mrnas from a genetically confirmed suc mutant strain, from the parental suc strain and from derivative meiotic segregants have shown that the three polypeptides (and therefore three mrna species) are encoded by one gene. analysis of in vivo radiolabeled invertase from the same suc and suc strains has verified that the suc locus contains the structural gene for secreted and cytoplasmic invertase. through the derepressed synthesis of multiple primary or processed transcripts, the suc and suc genes are regulated to produce multiple invertase polypeptides. the larger two polypeptides appear to be processed and secreted to yield glycosylated invertase, while the smallest remains in the cytoplasm.
