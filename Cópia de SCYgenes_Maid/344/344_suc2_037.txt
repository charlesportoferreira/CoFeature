cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding invertase (inv) from the yeast candida utilis.. . the gene inv encoding invertase from the yeast candida utilis has been cloned using a homologous pcr hybridization probe, amplified with two sets of degenerate primers designed considering sequence comparisons between yeast invertases. the cloned gene was sequenced and found to encode a polypeptide of amino acids that contain a amino acid signal peptide and potential n glycosylation sites. the nucleotide sequences of the ' and ' non coding regions were found to contain motifs probably involved in initiation, regulation and termination of gene transcription. the amino acid sequence shows significant identity with other yeast, bacterial and plant beta fructofuranosidases. the inv gene from c. utilis was able to complement functionally the suc mutation of s. cerevisiae.
