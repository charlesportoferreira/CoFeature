genetic evidence for a silent suc gene in yeast.. . the suc genes (suc suc) of saccharomyces are a family of genes that are dispersed in the yeast genome. a suc+ allele at any locus confers the ability to produce the enzyme invertase and, thus, to ferment sucrose. most yeast strains do not carry suc+ alleles at all possible suc loci. we have investigated the naturally occurring negative (suc) alleles present at suc loci with the aim of distinguishing between two possible models for the structure of suc alleles. () suc alleles correspond to a simple absence of suc genetic information; () suc alleles are &quot;silent&quot; suc genes that either produce a defective product or are not expressed. to facilitate these studies, sucrose nonfermenting strains were constructed that are congenic to s. cerevisiae strain sc (suc+), but carry at the suc locus the naturally occurring negative allele, suc(), of strain fl (lacroute ). these strains were used to study the genetic properties of the suc() allele of fl and the suc alleles (suc(), suc(), etc.) of sc. the suc() allele was shown to revert to an active suc+ state and to provide functional information at three points in the suc gene in recombination experiments; this suc() gene thus appears to be a &quot;silent&quot; gene. similar tests for silent suc genes in sc (corresponding to loci other than suc) failed to reveal any additional silent genes.
