spt, an essential gene that affects transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae, encodes a nuclear protein with an extremely acidic amino terminus.. . spt is an essential gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae that appears to play a role in transcription. mutations in the spt (ssn, cre) gene suppress delta insertion mutations in the ' regions of his and lys and mutations in cis and/or trans acting elements that are required for expression of suc and adh. we report here that spt encodes a kilodalton highly charged protein with an extremely acidic amino terminus. by use of an epitope tagged spt protein, we have determined by indirect immunofluorescence that the spt protein is located in the nucleus.
