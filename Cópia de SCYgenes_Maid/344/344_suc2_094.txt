ssn is an essential gene with mutant alleles that suppress defects in suc transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dominant and recessive mutations at the ssn locus were previously isolated as extragenic suppressors of mutations in three genes (snf, snf, and snf) that are required in trans to derepress invertase expression. all ssn alleles cause recessive, temperature sensitive lethality. in this study we cloned the ssn gene, identified a . kilobase poly(a) containing rna, and showed that disruption of the gene is lethal in a haploid cell. genetic mapping of ssn to a locus on chromosome vii centimorgans distal to cly led to the finding that ssn is the same gene as spt, which affects expression of delta insertions in the ' noncoding region of his (f. winston, d. t. chaleff, b. valent, and g. r. fink, genetics . , ). we also showed that an ssn mutation restored expression of secreted invertase from deletions of the suc upstream regulatory region; ssn restored derepression of suc mrna in strains with a suc upstream region deletion or a snf mutation. increased or decreased gene dosage of ssn also suppressed defects that are suppressed by ssn missense mutations. these findings suggest that ssn plays a role in general transcriptional processes.
