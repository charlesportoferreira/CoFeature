relationship of large and small invertases in saccharomyces. mutant selectively deficient in small invertase.. . a mutant strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae (d er) has been isolated after a two step mutagenesis of strain d (suc ) using ethyl methane sulfonate. cells of this new strain produced a level of total invertase equaling that of but contained only trace amounts of the small, internal, aglycan form of the enzyme (less than .% of total in d er compared with % in ). when d.er was crossed with an invertase hyperproducing strain dgr (suc), progeny were isolated (hz a and hz c) in which levels of total invertase had at least quadrupled. the percentage of small invertase, however, remained insignificant. levels of small invertase in strain hz a were determined by affinity chromatography on conconavalin a sepharose, gel permeation chromatography, and isopycnic centrifugation in cscl. the large invertase of the suc yeasts described here was found to contain a form apparently greater in size than the large invertase of the suc strain fhc; this probably reflects a higher content of carbohydrate. the overall results of this study do not support a direct structural relationship between large and small invertases. the implications on invertase biosynthesis and structure are discussed.
