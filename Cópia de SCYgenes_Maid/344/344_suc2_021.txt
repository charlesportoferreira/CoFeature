glycosylation of the overlapping sequons in yeast external invertase. effect of amino acid variation on site selectivity in vivo and in vitro.. . yeast invertase contains sequons, all of which are glycosylated to varying degrees except for sequon which is marginally glycosylated, if at all. this sequon overlaps with sequon in a sequence consisting of asn asn thr ser(reddy et al., , j. biol. chem., , ). to determine whether glycosylation at asnis sterically hindered by the oligosaccharide on asn, the latter amino acid was converted to a glutamine residue by site directed mutagenesis of the suc gene in a plasmid vector which was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae. a glycopeptide encompassing sequons through was purified from a tryptic digest of the mutagenized invertase and sequenced by edman degradation, which revealed that asn of sequon contained very little, if any, carbohydrate, despite the elimination of sequon . when ser and thr were inverted to yield asn asn ser thr carbohydrate was associated primarily with the second sequon, in agreement with numerous studies indicating that asn x thr is preferred to asn x ser as an oligosaccharide acceptor. however, when the invertase overlapping sequons were converted to asn asn ser ser, both sequons were clearly glycosylated, with the latter sequon predominating. these findings rule out steric hindrance as a factor involved in preventing the glycosylation of sequon in invertase. comparable results were obtained using an in vitro system with sequon containing tri and tetrapeptides acceptors, in addition to larger oligosaccharide acceptors.
