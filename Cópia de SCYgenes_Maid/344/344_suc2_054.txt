std (msn) interacts directly with the tata binding protein and modulates transcription of the suc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . std (msn) was isolated independently as a multicopy suppressor of mutations in the tata binding protein and in snf, suggesting that std might couple the snf kinase signaling pathway to the transcriptional machinery. we report here a direct physical interaction between std and the tata binding protein (tbp), observed in vivo by the two hybrid system and in vitro by binding studies. std bound both native tbp in yeast cell free extracts and purified recombinant tbp. this interaction was altered when tbp delta was used, suggesting a role for the non conserved n terminal domain of tbp in mediating protein protein interactions. we also show that perturbation of std tbp stoichiometry alters suc expression in vivo and that this effect is dependent on the n terminal domain of tbp. the activation of suc expression by increased copy number of std occurs at the level of mrna accumulation and it requires the same tata element and uses the same transcription start site as does activation of suc by glucose limitation. taken together, these results suggest that std modulates suc transcription through direct interactions with tbp.
