the secreted form of invertase in saccharomyces cerevisiae is synthesized from mrna encoding a signal sequence.. . the suc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two differently regulated mrnas (. and . kilobases) that differ at their ' ends. the larger rna encodes a secreted, glycosylated form of invertase and the smaller rna encodes an intracellular, nonglycosylated form. we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the amino terminal coding region of the suc gene and its upstream flanking region and have mapped the ' ends of the suc mrnas relative to the dna sequence. the . kilobase rna contains a signal peptide coding sequence and presumably encodes a precursor to secreted invertase. the . kilobase rna does not include the complete coding sequence for the signal peptide. the nucleotide sequence data prove that suc is a structural gene for invertase, and translation of the coding information provides the complete amino acid sequence of an s. cerevisiae signal peptide.
