differential expression of the invertase encoding suc genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . invertase (inv) is encoded in saccharomyces cerevisiae by a family of genes, comprising suc suc and suc. production of inv is highly variable, dependent on the strain and suc gene present in the cell. the differences in inv production derive from the structure of the genes or are dependent on the genetic background of the strain. centromeric plasmids (based on ycp) carrying one of the suc genes (except suc) were introduced into a strain (sey) lacking suc genes. the inv produced by the transformants was dependent on the individual suc genes, and correlated with inv mrna levels. plasmids in which suc had been placed under control of promoters from the other suc genes, were used to transform sey cells. the amounts of inv produced by cells carrying hybrid suc genes were in agreement with the levels expected if the promoter controlled the expression of the suc structural region. it is suggested that the differences in expression are a function of the transcription efficiency of the different suc gene promoters, based on the divergence of ' sequences.
