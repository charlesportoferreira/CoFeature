suc gene of saccharomyces. a structural gene for the large (glycoprotein) and small (carbohydrate free) forms of invertase.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae revertant strain d er has been shown to contain thermosensitive forms of the large (glycoprotein) and small (carbohydrate free) invertases and a very low level of the small enzyme, along with a wild type level of the large form (t. mizunaga et al., mol. cell. biol. . , ). these characteristics cosegregated in crosses of the revertant strain with wild type sucrose fermenting (suc) or nonfermenting (suc) strains. in addition, there is tight linkage between sucrose and maltose fermentation in revertant d er (characteristic of the suc and mal genes). from this we infer that a single reversion event is responsible for the several changes observed in d er, and that this mutation maps within or very close to the suc gene present in the ancestor strain d. the revertant suc allele in d er (termed suc r) was expressed independently of the wild type suc gene when both were present in diploid cells. diploids carrying only the wild type or the mutant genes synthesized invertases with the characteristics of the parental suc+ haploids. the possibility that a modifier gene was responsible for the alterations in the invertases of revertant d er was ruled out by appropriate crosses. we conclude that suc is a structural gene that codes for both the large and the small forms of invertase and suggest that suc through suc are structural genes as well.
