beta subunits of snf kinase are required for kinase function and substrate definition.. . the snf kinase and its mammalian homolog, the amp activated protein kinase, are heterotrimeric enzymes composed of a catalytic alpha subunit, a regulatory gamma subunit and a beta subunit that mediates heterotrimer formation. saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes three beta subunit genes, sip, sip and gal. earlier studies suggested that these subunits may not be required for snf kinase function. we show here that complete and precise deletion of all three beta subunit genes inactivates the snf kinase. the sipdelta sipdelta galdelta strain is unable to derepress invertase, grows poorly on alternative carbon sources and fails to direct the phosphorylation of the mig and sip proteins in vivo. the sip sipdelta galdelta strain manifests a subset of snf phenotypes (raf(+), gly( )) observed in the snfdelta strain (raf( ), gly( )), suggesting that individual beta subunits direct the snf kinase to a subset of its targets in vivo. indeed, deletion of individual beta subunit genes causes distinct differences in the induction and phosphorylation of sip, strongly suggesting that the beta subunits play an important role in substrate definition.
