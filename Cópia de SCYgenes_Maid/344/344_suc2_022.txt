glucose repression of the kluyveromyces lactis invertase gene klinv does not require migp.. . kluyveromyces lactis, a budding yeast related to saccharomyces cerevisiae, can grow on a wider variety of substrates and shows less sensitivity to glucose repression than does saccharomyces cerevisiae. many genes that are subject to glucose repression in s. cerevisiae are repressed only weakly or not at all in k. lactis. the molecular basis for this difference is largely unknown. to compare the mechanisms that regulate glucose repression in k. lactis and s. cerevisiae, we decided to clone and analyse an invertase gene from k. lactis. the suc gene, which encodes invertase in s. cerevisiae, is strongly regulated by glucose and serves as a model system for studies on glucose repression. the invertase gene of k. lactis, klinv, was isolated by colony hybridization using a conserved region within the inulinase gene of k. marxianus as a probe. two independent clones obtained were shown to contain the same orf of bp. the deduced amino acid sequence is % similar to that of the k. marxianus inulinase and shows % similarity to scsucp. gene disruption experiments and low stringency southern analysis indicate that klinv is a unique gene in k. lactis. northern analysis revealed that the transcription of klinv is strongly repressed in the presence of glucose, but, in contrast to the case in s. cerevisiae, repression is independent of klmigp.
