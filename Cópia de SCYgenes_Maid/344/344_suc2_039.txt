identification of cis acting elements in the suc promoter of saccharomyces cerevisiae required for activation of transcription.. . we analyzed the effects of site directed mutations in the suc promoter of saccharomyces cerevisiae. analyses were performed in wild type as well as mig and tup mutant strains after the promoter mutants were reintroduced into the native suc locus on the left arm of chromosome ix. mutation of the two gc boxes revealed that these elements play two distinct roles. they are, as expected, required for mig mediated repression but they are also necessary for activation of the suc promoter in response to glucose limitation. the individual gc boxes are functionally redundant with regard to mig mediated repression, however, only the upstream gc box is essential for high level expression of suc. microccocal nuclease sensitivity of the suc promoter in derepressed cells was reduced in the gc box mutant promoters, particularly in the vicinity of the tata box. the difference in nuclease sensitivity between wild type and gc box mutant promoters was not evident in tup cells. the formation of nuclease resistant chromatin does not require the gc boxes, indicating that other cis acting elements can serve to recruit the ssn tup co repressor complex to the suc promoter.
