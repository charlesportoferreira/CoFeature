presecretory and cytoplasmic invertase polypeptides encoded by distinct mrnas derived from the same structural gene differ by a signal sequence.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae strain fhc carries a single invertase structural gene, suc, but produces distinct invertase mrnas and polypeptides for the secreted and cytoplasmic forms of the enzyme. the two major invertase cell free translation products are polypeptides of , daltons (p) and , daltons (p) and correspond to the nonglycosylated cytoplasmic form of invertase and the precursor of glycosylated secreted invertase, respectively. this paper describes amino acid sequence and peptide map analyses of invertase polypeptides. the peptide maps demonstrate that p, p, and the in vivo secreted polypeptide have significant structural homology. sequence analysis, however, revealed differences between p and p at their amino termini. p contains an amino terminal signal sequence of amino acid residues that is specifically cleaved during secretion in a cell free system to generate the secreted , dalton invertase glycopeptide gp. this signal sequence is not present in p. p synthesis begins with a methionine which can be aligned with a methionine at residue in p . during translation, the p initiator methionine is removed and the newly generated amino terminus is acetylated. based on peptide map similarities, partial amino terminal sequence data, and common genetic origin, it is suggested that p and p have identical amino acid sequences carboxy terminal to the p initiator methionine (residue of p). the reciprocal correlations of signal sequence with secretion and absence of signal sequence with cytoplasmic localization provide proof of the signal hypothesis for secreted proteins. two mechanisms are proposed for the derivation of p and p from a single structural gene. alternative promoter sites, and differential processing of a single primary transcript.
