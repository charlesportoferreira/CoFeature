candida albicans ubi and ubi promoter regions confer differential regulation of invertase production to saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in response to stress.. . candida albicans ubiquitin genes ubi and ubi encode a ubiquitin hybrid protein involved in ribosome biogenesis and polyubiquitin, respectively. in this work we show that ubi and ubi promoter regions confer differential expression consistent with the function of their encoded gene products. hybrid genes were constructed containing the suc coding region under the control of ubi or ubi promoters in the yeast vector plc. invertase production in saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants was differentially regulated. the ubi promoter was induced by stress conditions (thermal upshift and/or starvation) whereas the ubi promoter conferred constitutive invertase production in growing yeast cells. these results indicate that the ubi promoter is regulated by stress response signaling pathways, whereas the ubi promoter is controlled according to the requirement for protein synthesis to support cell growth.
