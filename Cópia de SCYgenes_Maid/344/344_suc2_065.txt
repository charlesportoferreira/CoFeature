yeast sko gene encodes a bzip protein that binds to the cre motif and acts as a repressor of transcription.. . we have cloned a yeast gene, sko, which in high copy number suppresses lethal overexpression of camp dependent protein kinase. sko encodes a bzip protein that binds to the cre motif, tgacgtca. we found that sko also binds to a cre like site in suc, a yeast gene encoding invertase which is under positive control by camp. a disruption of the sko gene causes a partial derepression of suc, indicating that sko is a negative regulator of the suc gene. sko interacts positively with mig, a zinc finger protein that mediates glucose repression of suc. a kinetic analysis revealed a complex regulation of the suc mrna in response to glucose. first, mig mediates a rapid and strong repression of suc, which is complete within minutes. second, a mig independent process causes a further slow reduction in the mrna. third, in the absence of mig, there is also a rapid but transient glucose induction of the suc mrna. this induction is correlated with a transient loss of sko dependent repression.
