null mutations in the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae cause a different phenotype than do previously isolated missense mutations.. . missense mutations in the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae were previously found to cause defects in both glucose repression and derepression of the suc (invertase) gene. in addition, the growth properties of snf mutants suggested that they were defective in uptake of glucose and fructose. we have cloned the snf gene by complementation and demonstrated linkage of the cloned dna to the chromosomal snf locus. the gene encodes a kilobase poly(a) containing rna, which was fivefold more abundant in cells deprived of glucose. the snf gene was disrupted at its chromosomal locus by several methods to create null mutations. disruption resulted in growth phenotypes consistent with a defect in glucose uptake. surprisingly, gene disruption did not cause aberrant regulation of suc expression. we discuss possible mechanisms by which abnormal snf gene products encoded by missense alleles could perturb regulatory functions.
