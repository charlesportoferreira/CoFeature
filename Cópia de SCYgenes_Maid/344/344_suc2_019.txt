mouse caf, a mouse homologue of the yeast pop gene, complements the yeast pop null mutation.. . the yeast pop protein (popp) is a component of a global transcription regulatory complex and is required for gene expression of many genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we constructed pop deletion plasmids encoding various popp regions under the native pop promoter and found that the minimum functional region was located in two thirds of the carboxyl terminal region. a mouse homologue of the pop gene (mcaf), which corresponds to the popp minimum region, partially rescued the growth defect of pop null mutant cells. addition of the popp amino terminal region to mcaf strengthened the suppression. mcaf also weakly suppressed the relatively high expression of the suc gene of pop cells under glucose repressing conditions; however, it failed to suppress the defect of full expression of the suc gene under glucose derepressing conditions. our findings clearly demonstrate that a mammalian homologue can substitute for the yeast pop gene in some aspect. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
