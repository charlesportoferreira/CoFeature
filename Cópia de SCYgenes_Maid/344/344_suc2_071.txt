new snf genes, gal and grr affect suc expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . to identify new genes required for depression of the suc (invertase) gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have isolated mutants with defects in raffinose utilization. in addition to mutations in suc and previously identified snf genes, we recovered recessive mutations that define four new complementation groups, designated snf through snf. these mutations cause defects in the derepression of suc in response to glucose limitation. we also recovered five alleles of gal and showed that a gal null mutation decreases suc expression to % of the wild type level. finally, one of the mutants carries a grr allele that converts suc from a glucose inducible gene.
