characterization of the glycosylation sites in yeast external invertase. ii. location of the endo beta n acetylglucosaminidase h resistant sequons.. . there are potential asn x thr/ser glycosylation sites, or sequons, in the yeast external invertase sequence. of these, are wholly or partially glycosylated to give an average of oligosaccharides/subunit (reddy, v. a., johnson, r. s., biemann, k., williams, r. s., ziegler, f. d., trimble, r. b., and maley, f. () j. biol. chem. , ). on digestion of native holoenzyme by endo beta n acetylglucosaminidase h (endo h) an average of about seven oligosaccharides per subunit are released without affecting enzyme activity (trimble, r. b., and maley, f. () j. biol. chem. , ). to determine whether the remaining endo h resistant chains were restricted to a limited number of unique sequons or were randomly distributed on all , endo h treated native invertase was digested with either thermolysin or trypsin and the resultant glycopeptides isolated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gel filtration. it was found that the oligosaccharides attached to asn, asn, and asn were partially resistant to endo h, while those at asn and asn) were completely resistant. bio gel p analysis revealed the endo h resistant oligosaccharides at asn, asn, asn, and asn to be man glcnac, while the minor residual carbohydrate at asn was man greater than glcnac. the endo h susceptible oligosaccharides at asn, asn, and asn were man greater than glcnac while all other glycosylation sites contained man glcnac. based on a hydropathic analysis of invertase, the two most endo h resistant oligosaccharides at asn and asn were located in the more hydrophobic regions of the molecule. these may form part of the folded protein structure or interacting subunit surfaces, thus restricting their accessibility to endo h.
