dnase i sensitivity of the chromatin of the yeast suc gene for invertase.. . the dnase i sensitivity of chromatin of the yeast suc gene, which encodes two forms of invertase, has been studied both in the genome and in a multicopy plasmid carrying the gene and its flaking sequences. whereas little if any difference in the dnase i sensitivity of the flanking regions was found between the repressed and the derepressed states, derepression of the gene was accompanied by a large increase in the sensitivity of the transcribed region. a well defined dnase i hypersensitive site was found centered at approximately bp downstream from the end of the coding region. this site seems to be flanked in the ' non coding region by strictly positioned nucleosomes, and the structure of this region changes upon derepression. in the ' non coding region two dnase i hypersensitive sites have been found flanking the tata box and a set of three closely spaced hypersensitive sites occurs in an upstream regulatory sequence. the structure of these latter sites depends on the on off state of transcription.
