molecular and biochemical characterization of the dio resistant pma mutation of the h(+) atpase from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the plasma membrane h(+) atpase gene pma was sequenced in four dio resistant strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae, isolated independently. the same amino acid substitution ala thr was found in the four mutated strains. the mutant atpase activity was decreased while the km value for mgatp was increased. the atpase efficiency (v/km) of the mutant was reduced by a factor of under acid conditions (ph .), and by a factor of at physiological ph (ph .). the mutation also strongly reduces the inhibition by vanadate of atpase activity, suggesting that the altered amino acid is involved in phosphate binding and/or in the e e transition.
