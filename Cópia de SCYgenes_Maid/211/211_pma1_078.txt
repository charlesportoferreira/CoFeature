near uv induced absorbance change and photochemical decomposition of ergosterol in the plasma membrane of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . when cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were exposed to near uv ( nm), their absorption spectra changed slightly within the range nm with increasing dosage. difference spectra, calculated by substracting the curve recorded in cells exposed to near uv from the curve of unexposed cells, decreased with increasing dosage over a broad band with peaks at , and nm and a shoulder at nm. these peaks were in agreement with the absorption maxima of ergosterol, which is one of the major components of the plasma membrane of yeast. near uv radiation induced a simultaneous decrease in absorption spectra and reduction of ergosterol content in the plasma membrane. photochemical decomposition of ergosterol by near uv radiation was revealed in vivo, although ergosterol is generally known to be photoconverted to previtamin d industrially by uv radiation in vitro. in order to remove photosensitizers, liposomes were prepared from phospholipids and glycolipids, with or without ergosterol from purified yeast plasma membranes. liposomal ergosterol in the orientated state was photochemically decomposed by near uv radiation but ergosterol in the disorientated state in a homogeneous solution was not. near uv radiation also induced a decrease in activity of membrane bound atpase. dose response curves for the reduction of atpase activity were similar to that for decomposition of ergosterol, suggesting that near uv caused membrane function damage.
