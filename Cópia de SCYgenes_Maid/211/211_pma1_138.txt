pcr amplification of dna sequences from the transcription factor iid and cation transporting atpase genes in pneumocystis carinii.. . oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify dna sequences from a plasma membrane cation transporting atpase gene and a transcription factor iid (tfiid) gene from pneumocystis carinii genomic dna. the entire p. carinii atpase gene was cloned from a genomic library by hybridization to the pcr amplified dna product. the nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a , base pair open reading frame that encoded a , dalton protein composed of amino acids. the p. carinii atpase protein was % identical to four fungal proton pumps but less than % identical to protozoan and mammalian cation transporting atpase genes or the ca++ atpases of saccharomyces. the nucleotide sequence of a portion of the tfiid gene could be translated to produce a peptide of amino acids in two regions of the sequence, interrupted by a bp intron. the predicted tfiid amino acid sequence was identical to yeast tfiid genes in this region.
