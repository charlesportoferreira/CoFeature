hsp, the integral plasma membrane heat shock protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a stress inducible regulator of plasma membrane h(+) atpase.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein (hsp). this hsp is induced by several stresses, including heat shock, ethanol exposure, severe osmostress, weak organic acid exposure and glucose limitation. plasma membrane h(+) atpase activities of heat shocked and weak acid adapted, hsp mutant and wild type cells, revealed that hsp induction leads to a downregulation of the stress stimulation of this h(+) atpase. plasma membrane h(+) atpase activity consumes a substantial fraction of the atp generated by the cell, a usage that will be increased by the h(+) atpase stimulation occurring with several hsp inducing stresses. hsp might therefore provide an energy conservation role, limiting excessive atp consumption by plasma membrane h(+) atpase during prolonged stress exposure or glucose limitation. consistent with the role of hsp being energy conservation, hsp null cultures give lower final biomass yields. they also have lower atp levels, consistent with higher h(+) atpase activity, at the glucose exhaustion stage of batch fermentations (diauxic lag), when hsp is normally induced. loss of hsp does not affect several stress tolerances but it extends the time needed for cells to adapt to growth under several stressful conditions where the maintenance of homeostasis will demand an unusually high usage of energy, hsp is the first yeast gene identified as both weak organic acid inducible and assisting the adaptation to growth in the presence of these acids.
