complementation in situ of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase gene pma by an h(+) atpase gene from a heterologous species.. . in plants and fungi, the transport of solutes across the plasma membrane (pm) is driven by a proton pump (h(+) atpase) that produces an electric potential and a ph gradient. we expressed aha, a member of the arabidopsis thaliana pm h(+) atpase gene family, in yeast cells in which transcription of the endogenous pm h(+) atpase gene (pma) had been turned off. aha was expressed mainly in intracellular membranes and only supported very slow growth of transformed yeast cells. removal of the last c terminal amino acids from the plant h(+) atpase produced an enzyme with fold higher specific atpase activity than the wild type plant enzyme. surprisingly, the truncated h(+) atpase was now targetted to the yeast pm and fully supported normal yeast growth.
