membrane potential defect in hygromycin b resistant pma mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the proton transport properties of hygromycin b resistant pma mutants which show kinetic defects in the plasma membrane h+ atpase were examined. it was found that net proton efflux, as measured by whole cell medium acidification in the presence of mm kcl, was similar for normal and pma mutant cells. however, in the absence of added kcl, the extent of net proton efflux was considerably less in wild type than in pma mutant cells. the cellular membrane potential was implicated as an important factor in regulating net proton transport and was determined from [c]tetraphenylphosphonium uptake studies to be considerably depolarized in the pma mutants. the growth of wild type cells, which is normally inhibited by hygromycin b at micrograms/ml, was found to be resistant to the antibiotic by the addition of mm kcl to the growth medium. these results suggest that the electrogenic behavior of proton transport by the h+ atpase may be altered in pma mutants and that resistance to hygromycin b may be mediated via depolarization of the cellular membrane potential.
