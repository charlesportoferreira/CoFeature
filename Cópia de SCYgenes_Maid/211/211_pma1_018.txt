a mutant plasma membrane atpase, pma , is defective in stability at the yeast cell surface.. . pma is a plasma membrane h(+) atpase whose activity at the cell surface is essential for cell viability. in this paper we describe a temperature sensitive pma allele, pma (with two point mutations in the first cytoplasmic loop of pma), in which the newly synthesized mutant protein fails to remain stable at the cell surface at degrees c. instead, pma appears to undergo internalization for vacuolar degradation in a manner dependent on end, vps, doa, and pep. by contrast with wild type pma, mutant pma is hypophosphorylated and fails to associate with a triton insoluble fraction at degrees c, suggesting failure to enter lipid rafts. kinetic analysis reveals that, at the permissive temperature, newly synthesized pma acquires triton insolubility before becoming stabilized. we suggest that phosphorylation and lipid raft association may play important roles in maintaining protein stability at the plasma membrane.
