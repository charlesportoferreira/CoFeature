molecular evaluation of the plasma membrane proton pump from aspergillus fumigatus.. . the gene encoding the plasma membrane proton pump (h+ atpase) of aspergillus fumigatus, pma, was characterized from a. fumigatus strain nih and clinical isolate h . an open reading frame of , nucleotides with two introns near the n terminus predicts a protein consisting of amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately kda. the predicted a. fumigatus enzyme is and % identical to h+ atpases of aspergillus nidulans and saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. the a. fumigatus pma is a typical member of the p type atpase family that contains predicted transmembrane segments and conserved sequence motifs tges, csdktgt, mltgd, and gdgvn within the catalytic region. the enzyme represents % of the total plasma membrane protein, and it is characteristically inhibited by orthovanadate, with a % inhibitory concentration of approximately . microm. h+ atpases from aspergillus spp. contain a highly acidic insertion region of amino acids between transmembrane segments and , which was confirmed for the membrane assembled enzyme with a peptide derived antibody. an increasing a. fumigatus pma copy number confers enhanced growth in low ph medium, consistent with its role as a proton pump. these results provide support for the development of the a. fumigatus h+ atpase as a potential drug discovery target.
