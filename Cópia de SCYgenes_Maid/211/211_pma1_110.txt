modeling a conformationally sensitive region of the membrane sector of the fungal plasma membrane proton pump.. . a molecular model for transmembrane segments and from the fungal proton pumping atpase has been developed, and this structure is predicted to form a helical hairpin loop structure in the membrane. this region was selected because it is highly conformationally active and is believed to be an important site of action for clinically important therapeutics in related animal cell enzymes. the hairpin loop is predicted to form an asymmetric tightly packed structure that is stabilized by an n cap between d and v, by hydrogen bonding between residues in the turn region and the helices, and by pi pi interactions between closely apposed aromatic residues. a short four residue s shaped turn is stabilized by hydrogen bonding but is predicted to be conformationally heterogeneous. the principal effect of mutations within the hairpin head region is to destabilize the local close packing of side groups which disrupts the pattern of hydrogen bonding in and around the turn region. depending on the mutation, this causes either a localized or a more global distortion of the primary structure in the hairpin region. these altered structures may explain the effects of mutations in transmembrane segments and on atp hydrolysis, sensitivity to vanadate, and electrogenic proton transport. the conformational sensitivity of the hairpin structure around the s turn may also account for the effects of sch and possibly ouabain in blocking atpase function in related animal cell enzymes. finally, the model of transmembrane segments and serves as a template to position transmembrane segments and . this model provides a new view of the h(+) atpase that promotes novel structure/function experimentation and could serve as the basis for a more detailed model of the membrane sector of this enzyme.
