characterization of the plasma membrane mg+ atpase from the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the plasma membrane of saccharomyces cerevisiae has a mg+ dependent atpase which is distinct from the mitochondrial mg+ atpase and at the ph optimum of . has a km for atp of . mm and a vmax of . mumol of atp hydrolyzed/mg/min. at least three protein components of the crude membrane (mr = ,, , and ,) are labeled with [gamma&quot;p]atp at ph .. these phosphoproteins form rapidly in the presence of mg+, rapidly turn over the bound phosphate when unlabeled atp is added, and dephosphorylate after incubation in the presence of hydroxylamine. vanadate, an inhibitor of the mg+ atpase activity, blocks the phosphorylation of the , and , dalton proteins. at ph ., only the , and , dalton proteins are phosphorylated. while these three phosphorylated intermediates have not been unambiguously identified as components of the mg+ atpase, the finding of such phosphorylated components in association with that activity implies that this enzyme differs in mechanism from the mitochondrial proton pump and that it is similar in mechanism to the metal ion pumps ((na+ k+) atpase and ca+ atpase) of the mammalian plasma membrane.
