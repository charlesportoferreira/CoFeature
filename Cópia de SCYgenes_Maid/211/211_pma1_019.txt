helical stalk segments s and s of the plasma membrane h+ atpase from saccharomyces cerevisiae are optimized to impact catalytic site environment.. . the stalk segments of p type ion translocating enzymes are presumed to play important roles in energy coupling. in this work, stalk segments s and s of the yeast h(+) atpase were examined for helical character, optimal length, and segment orientation by a combination of proline substitution, insertion/deletion mutagenesis, and second site suppressor analyses. the substitution of various residues for helix disrupting proline in both s (lp,lg; ap; and gp) and s (dp and ip) resulted in highly defective or inactive enzymes supporting the importance of helical character and/or the maintenance of essential interactions. the contiguous helical nature of transmembrane segment m and stalk element s was explored and found to be favorable, although not essential. the deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at positions ala() in s and asp() in s, which were intended to either rotate helical faces or extend/reduce the length of helical segments, resulted in enzyme destabilization that abolished most enzyme assembly. second site suppressor mutations were obtained to primary site mutations ga (s) and dg (s) and were analyzed with a molecular structure model of the h(+) atpase. primary site mutations were predicted to alter the site of phosphorylation either directly or indirectly. the suppressor mutations either directly changed packing around the primary site or altered the environment of the site of phosphorylation. overall, these data support the view that stalk segments s and s of the h(+) atpase are helical elements that are optimized for length and interactions with other stalk elements and can influence the phosphorylation domain.
