the two major types of plant plasma membrane h+ atpases show different enzymatic properties and confer differential ph sensitivity of yeast growth.. . the proton pumping atpase (h+ atpase) of the plant plasma membrane is encoded by two major gene subfamilies. to characterize individual h+ atpases, pma, an h+ atpase isoform of tobacco (nicotiana plumbaginifolia), was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and found to functionally replace the yeast h+ atpase if the external ph was kept above . (a. de kerchove d'exaerde, p. supply, j.p. dufour, p. bogaerts, d. thines, a. goffeau, m. boutry [] j biol chem . ). in the present study we replaced the yeast h+ atpase with pma, an h+ atpase isoform from the second subfamily. yeast expressing pma grew at a ph as low as .. this was correlated with a higher acidification of the external medium and an approximately % increase of atpase activity compared with pma. although both pma and pma had a similar ph optimum (. .), the profile was different on the alkaline side. at ph . pma kept more than % of the maximal activity, whereas that of pma decreased to less than %. both enzymes were stimulated up to fold by microgram/ml lysophosphatidylcholine, but this stimulation vanished at a higher concentration in pma. these data demonstrate functional differences between two plant h+ atpases expressed in the same heterologous host. characterization of two pma mutants selected to allow yeast growth at ph . revealed that mutations within the carboxy terminal region of pma could still improve the enzyme, resulting in better growth of yeast cells.
