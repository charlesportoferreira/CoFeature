physical, transcriptional and genetical mapping of a kb dna fragment located between the pma and ate loci on chromosome vii from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a physical map of a contiguous dna fragment of kb, extending from the centromere to trp on the left arm of the chromosome vii of saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain il b, was established. within a kb region from pma towards trp, a total of transcription products ranging from . to . kb were identified in cells grown exponentially on rich medium. near % of the dna investigated was transcribed and on average one transcript, of . kb average length, was detected every . kb of dna. the physical and genetical distances between the markers cen, pma, leu, pdr and trp were compared. a recombination frequency of cm corresponds to an average distance of . kb between alleles in this region of chromosome vii.
