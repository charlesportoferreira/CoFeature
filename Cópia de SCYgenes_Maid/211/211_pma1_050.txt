stress factors acting at the level of the plasma membrane induce transcription via the stress response element (stre) of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a variety of stress factors induces transcription via the stress response element (stre) present in control regions of a number of genes of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. induction of transcription involves nuclear translocation of the stre binding transcription activators msnp and msnp. the primary cellular events triggering this translocation are presently not well understood. in this investigation, we have observed that a number of factors acting at the level of the yeast plasma membrane, including the antifungal agent nystatin, the steroidal alkaloid tomatine, benzyl alcohol, a number of detergents and the plasma membrane h+ atpase inhibitor diethylstilbestrol or mutations in the pma gene encoding the plasma membrane atpase, induce msnp nuclear accumulation and stre dependent transcription. at least some of the stress factors acting via stres cause an increase in plasma membrane permeability, leading to a decrease in membrane potential, which might be a primary cellular stress signal. a decrease in internal ph triggered by permeabilization of the plasma membrane or a change in camp levels are at least not obligatory factors in intracellular stress signal transduction. the signal transduction pathway transmitting the signal generated at the plasma membrane to msnp is still unknown.
