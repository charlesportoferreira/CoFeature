evidence for a salt bridge between transmembrane segments and of the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase.. . the plasma membrane h+ atpase of saccharomyces cerevisiae, which belongs to the p subgroup of cation transporting atpases, is encoded by the pma gene and functions physiologically to pump protons out of the cell. this study has focused on hydrophobic transmembrane segments m and m of the h+ atpase. in particular, a conserved aspartate residue near the middle of m has been found to play a critical role in the structure and biogenesis of the atpase. site directed mutants in which asp was replaced by an uncharged residue (asn or val) were abnormally sensitive to trypsin, consistent with the idea that the proteins were poorly folded, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed them to be arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum. similar defects are known to occur when either arg or his in m is replaced by a neutral residue (dutra, m. b., ambesi, a., and slayman, c. w. () j. biol. chem. , ). to search for possible charge charge interactions between asp and arg or his , double mutants were constructed in which positively and negatively charged residues were swapped or eliminated. strikingly, two of the double mutants (rd/dr and ra/da) regained the capacity for normal biogenesis and displayed near normal rates of atp hydrolysis and atp dependent h+ pumping. these results demonstrate that neither arg nor asp is required for enzymatic activity or proton transport, but suggest that there is a salt bridge between the two residues, linking m and m of the kda polypeptide.
