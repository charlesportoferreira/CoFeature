characterization of dominant lethal mutations in the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase gene.. . site directed mutants of yeast atpase were studied after introduction of mutant alleles into a yeast strain where these alleles were constitutively expressed and the expression of the wild type chromosomal atpase gene was turned off. one objection to this constitutive expression system was made apparent recently, as dominant lethal mutations are lost by gene conversion with the wild type allele during the process. here, the phenotypes of the mutant alleles, which were studied in a constitutive expression system, are re evaluated under conditions in which these site directed mutants are conditionally expressed. we show that of site directed mutations previously described are actually dominant lethal alleles. in addition, we show that dominant mutant proteins interfere with transport of wild type atpase to the plasma membrane.
