hocl mediated cell death and metabolic dysfunction in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the nature of oxidative damage to saccharomyces cerevisiae caused by levels of hocl that inhibit cell replication was explored with the intent of identifying the loci of lethal lesions. functions of cytosolic enzymes and organelles that are highly sensitive to inactivation by hocl, including aldolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and the mitochondrion, were only marginally affected by exposure of the yeast to levels of hocl that completely inhibited colony formation. loss of function in membrane localized proteins, including the hexose transporters and pma h(+) atpase, which is the primary proton pump located within the s. cerevisiae plasma membrane, was also marginal and k(+) leak rates to the extracellular medium increased only slowly with exposure to increasing amounts of hocl, indicating that the plasma membrane retained its intrinsic impermeability to ions and metabolites. adenylate phosphorylation levels in fermenting yeast declined in parallel with viability; however, yeast grown on respiratory substrates maintained near normal phosphorylation levels at hocl doses several fold greater than that required for killing. this overall pattern of cellular response to hocl differs markedly from that previously reported for bacteria, which appear to be killed by inhibition of plasma membrane proteins involved in energy transduction. the absence of significant loss of function in critical oxidant sensitive cellular components and retention of atp synthesizing capabilities in respiring yeast cells exposed to lethal levels of hocl suggests that toxicity in this case may arise by programmed cell death.
