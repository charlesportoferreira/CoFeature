interactions between the gene products of pma encoding plasma membrane h(+) atpase, and pdr controlling multiple drug resistance in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pma mutations controlling the vanadate resistance of the h(+) atpase activity from the plasma membrane, map on chromosome vii in the vicinity of pdr mutations controlling multiple drug resistance. however, the pma mutants exhibit a genotype and a multidrug resistant phenotype quite different from those obtained for pdr mutants. quantitative modifications of cycloheximide and n,n' (p xylylidene) bis aminoguanidine hcl resistance are observed in diploids containing the pma and pdr genes in trans configuration. each of the pdr mutations interacts with pma as shown by a decrease in the atpase activity in pdr/pma diploids. the in vitro resistance of atpase activity to vanadate is totally or partially suppressed in pdr mutants in haploid double mutants. these results suggest that the expression of pma might be controlled by the pdr gene product.
