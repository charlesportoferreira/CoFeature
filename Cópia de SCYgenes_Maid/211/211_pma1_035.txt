sequencing and heterologous expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae of a cryptococcus neoformans cdna encoding a plasma membrane h(+) atpase.. . a cdna containing an open reading frame encoding a putative plasma membrane h(+) atpase in the human pathogenic basidiomycetous yeast cryptococcus neoformans was cloned and sequenced by means of pcr and cdna library hybridization. the cloned cdna is bp in length, containing a bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of amino acids. as in the case of another basidiomycetous fungus (uromyces fabae), the deduced amino acid sequence of cnpma was found to be more homologous to those of p type h(+) atpases from higher plants than to those from ascomycetous fungi. in order to prove the sequenced cdna corresponds to a h(+) atpase, it was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and found to functionally replace its own h(+) atpase. kinetic studies of cnpma compared to scpma show differences in v(max) values and h(+) pumping in reconstituted vesicles. the ph optimum and k(m) values are similar in both enzymes.
