post translational modification of plant plasma membrane h(+) atpase as a requirement for functional complementation of a yeast transport mutant.. . many heterologous membrane proteins expressed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae fail to reach their normal cellular location and instead accumulate in stacked internal membranes. arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane h(+) atpase isoform (aha) is expressed predominantly in yeast internal membranes and fails to complement a yeast strain devoid of its endogenous h(+) atpase pma. we observed that phosphorylation of aha in the heterologous host and subsequent binding of protein is crucial for the ability of aha to substitute for pma. thus, mutants of aha, complementing pma, showed increased phosphorylation at the penultimate residue (thr()), which creates a binding site for endogenous protein. only a pool of atpase in the plasma membrane is phosphorylated. double mutants carrying in addition a ta substitution lost their ability to complement pma. however, mutants affected in both autoinhibitory regions of the c terminal regulatory domain complemented pma irrespective of their ability to become phosphorylated at thr(). this demonstrates that it is the activity status of the mutant enzyme and neither redirection of trafficking nor binding per se that determines the ability of h(+) pumps to rescue pma.
