mutation of a conserved glycine residue modifies the vanadate sensitivity of the plasma membrane h+ atpase from schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . the structural gene pma+ for the h+ atpase from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe has been isolated and sequenced. the intron less gene encodes for a protein of mr = , which is % homologous to those of saccharomyces cerevisiae and neurospora crassa. the s. pombe pma+ gene complements not only s. pombe pma but also s. cerevisiae pma mutants selected for in vitro vanadate resistant atpase activity. the sequence of the s. pombe mutant pma allele reveals that the glycine residue , which is perfectly conserved in the transduction domain of all animal and fungal transport atpases sequenced so far, is modified into an aspartate residue by the mutation. replacement of glycine by aspartate has been monitored by the appearance of a new pvui restriction site in the mutant dna. mitotic cosegregation has been observed between the pvui site and vanadate resistant atpase activity in a growing population of s. pombe transformants.
