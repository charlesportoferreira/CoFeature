genetic characterization of the ()dppr motif of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase.. . the highly conserved motif +()dppr of saccharomyces cerevisiae h(+) atpase, located in the putative atp binding site, has been mutagenized and the resulting mutant genes conditionally expressed in secretory vesicles. fourteen mutant atpases (da, dv, dl, dn, dg, dt, pa, pv, pl, pg, pt, pe, pk and rt) failed to reach the secretory vesicles. of these mutants, nine (dn, dt, pa, pv, pl, pg, pt, pe and pk) were not detected in total cellular membranes, and five (da, dv, dg, dl and rt) were retained at the endoplasmic reticulum and exhibited a dominant lethal phenotype. the remaining mutants (de, ra, rv, rl, rn, rg, re, rk and rh) reached the secretory vesicles at levels similar to that of the wild type. of these, six (ra, rv, rl, rn, rg, and re) showed severely decreased atpase activity compared to the wild type enzyme, and three (de, rk and rh) rendered an enzyme with an altered k(m) for atp.
