sphingoid base synthesis is required for oligomerization and cell surface stability of the yeast plasma membrane atpase, pma.. . the plasma membrane h(+) atpase, pma, is an essential and long lived integral membrane protein. previous work has demonstrated that the pma dn mutant is a substrate for endoplasmic reticulum (er) associated degradation and causes a dominant negative effect on cell growth by preventing er export of wild type pma. we now show that pma dn is ubiquitylated, and it heterooligomerizes with wild type pma, resulting in ubiquitylation and er associated degradation of wild type pma. in temperature sensitive lcb cells, defective in sphingoid base synthesis, pma fails to oligomerize. at degrees c, lcb is a suppressor of pma dn because wild type pma fails to heterooligomerize with pma dn; wild type pma moves to the cell surface, indicating that oligomerization is not required for delivery to the plasma membrane. even in the absence of pma dn, wild type pma is ubiquitylated and it undergoes internalization from the cell surface and vacuolar degradation at degrees c in lcb cells. at degrees c in lcb cells, a more severe defect occurs in sphingoid base synthesis, and targeting of newly synthesized pma to the plasma membrane is impaired. these data indicate requirements for sphingolipids at three discrete stages. pma oligomerization at the er, targeting to the plasma membrane, and stability at the cell surface.
