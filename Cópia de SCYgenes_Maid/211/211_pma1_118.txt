cloning and sequence analysis of an h(+) atpase encoding gene from the human dimorphic pathogen histoplasma capsulatum.. . a gene related to the pma gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated from the pathogenic human dimorphic fungus, histoplasma capsulatum, using fungal specific oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) probes. this gene has been given the name hc pma. the structural organization of hc pma consists of three exons (, and bp) and two introns ( and bp). the nucleotide sequence predicts an h(+) atpase related protein of amino acids (aa). comparison of the deduced aa sequence to that of neurospora crassa and s. cerevisiae (pma) plasma membrane h(+) atpases showed a greater similarity to that from n. crassa (% identity). furthermore, the two introns in the hc pma gene interrupt the coding region in the precise locations determined for two of the four n. crassa nc pma introns. h. capsulatum intron contains two repeat motifs, d(ta) and d(tg), each potentially capable of forming non b dna structures. northern analysis of h. capsulatum total rna indicated that the hc pma specific mrna is approx. . kb in size, in agreement with the predicted size of the gene.
