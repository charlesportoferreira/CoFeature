functional role of charged residues in the transmembrane segments of the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase.. . as defined by hydropathy analysis, the membrane spanning segments of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase contain seven negatively charged amino acids (asp and glu) and four positively charged amino acids (arg and his). to explore the functional role of these residues, site directed mutants at all positions and at glu , located near the cytoplasmic end of m, have been constructed and expressed in yeast secretory vesicles. substitutions at four of the positions (glu , glu , asp , and arg ) had no significant effect on atp hydrolysis or atp dependent proton pumping, substitutions at five additional positions (arg , his , asp , asp , and arg ) led to misfolding of the atpase and blockage at an early stage of biogenesis, and substitutions of asp allowed measurable biogenesis but nearly abolished atp hydrolysis and proton transport. of greatest interest were mutations of glu in m and glu in m, which altered the apparent coupling between hydrolysis and transport. three glu mutants (eq, el, ed) showed significantly reduced pumping over a wide range of hydrolysis values and thus appeared to be partially uncoupled. at glu , by contrast, one mutant (en) was almost completely uncoupled, while another (eq) pumped protons at an enhanced rate relative to the rate of atp hydrolysis. both glu and glu occupy positions at which amino acid substitutions have been shown to affect transport by mammalian p atpases. taken together, the results provide growing evidence that residues in membrane segments and of the p atpases contribute to the cation transport pathway and that the fundamental mechanism of transport has been conserved throughout the group.
