characterization of an allele nonspecific intragenic suppressor in the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase gene (pma).. . we have analyzed the ability of av, vi/dn, and pl mutations to suppress pma dominant lethal alleles and found that the pl mutation is able to suppress the dominant lethality of the pma rt, dn, de, and kr mutant alleles. genetic and biochemical analyses of site directed mutants at pro suggest that this amino acid may not be essential for function but is important for biogenesis of the atpase. proteins encoded by dominant lethal pma alleles are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, thus interfering with transport of wild type pma. immunofluorescence studies of yeast conditionally expressing revertant alleles show that the mutant enzymes are correctly located at the plasma membrane and do not disturb targeting of the wild type enzyme. we propose that changes in pro may influence the folding of the protein encoded by a dominant negative allele so that it is no longer recognized and retained as a misfolded protein by the endoplasmic reticulum.
