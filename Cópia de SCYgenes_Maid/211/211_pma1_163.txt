genetic and molecular mapping of the pma mutation conferring vanadate resistance to the plasma membrane atpase from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the pma mutations confers vanadate resistance to h+ atpase activity when measured in isolated plasma membranes. in vivo, the growth of pma mutants is resistant to dio , ethidium bromide and guanidine derivatives. this phenotype was used to map the pma mutation adjacent to leu gene on chromosome vii. from a cosmid library of a wild type saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, a large kb dna fragment was isolated by complementation of a leu pma double mutant. a kb hindiii fragment was subcloned and it restored both leu+ and pma+ phenotypes after integrative transformation. the restriction map of the kb hindiii fragment and southern blot analysis reveal that the cloned fragment contains the entire structural gene for the plasma membrane atpase and the ' end of the adjacent leu gene. the pma mutation conferring vanadate resistance is thus located in the structural gene for the plasma membrane atpase.
