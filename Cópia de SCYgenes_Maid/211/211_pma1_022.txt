plasma membrane proton atpase pmap requires raft association for surface delivery in yeast.. . correct sorting of proteins is essential to generate and maintain the identity and function of the different cellular compartments. in this study we demonstrate the role of lipid rafts in biosynthetic delivery of pmap, the major plasma membrane proton atpase, to the cell surface. disruption of rafts led to mistargeting of pmap to the vacuole. conversely, pma , an atpase mutant that is mistargeted to the vacuole, was shown to exhibit impaired raft association. one of the previously identified suppressors, multicopy ast, not only restored surface delivery but also raft association of pma . astp, which is a peripheral membrane protein, was found to directly interact with pmap inducing its clustering into a sds/triton x resistant oligomer. we suggest that clustering facilitates partition of pmap into rafts and transport to the cell surface.
