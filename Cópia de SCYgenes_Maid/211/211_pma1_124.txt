characterization of yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase mutant pma av and its revertants.. . an av substitution in the first transmembrane segment of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase (pma) confers cellular resistance to hygromycin b, exhibits growth sensitivity to low external ph, and results in a defective enzyme that hydrolyzes atp at % of wild type level. the importance of the a residue was probed genetically by analysis involving both site directed mutagenesis and randomly generated second site intragenic suppressor mutations. no other amino acid at position gave either the wild type phenotype or the normal enzyme activity of a. substitutions with the bulkier amino acid residues al, ai, and af produced more severe cellular phenotypes than the original av mutation. the substitution of the smaller side chain residue gly was also a mutant, although not as severe as the av mutant. the introduction of a bulky trp or a polar ser residue produced dominant lethality, while charged amino acids produced recessive lethality. reduced rates of proton transport measured by acidification of the medium by whole cells correlate closely with the severity of cellular phenotype. some of the mutant enzymes exhibit an apparent instability in vitro. thus, the localized structure around a is highly constrained. the cellular sensitivity to low external ph of the av mutant was used to select intragenic revertants. most full revertants (low phr, hygs) restored a, but second site mutations in putative transmembrane segments (vi and vf) and (lv) were also observed. two partial revertants (low phr, hygr) have secondary mutations at sc or a double change at fl sf in the putative atp binding domain. these results provide additional evidence for functional coupling between the cytoplasmic domain catalyzing atp hydrolysis and transmembrane helices and .
