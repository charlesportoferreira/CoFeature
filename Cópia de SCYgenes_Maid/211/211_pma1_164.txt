immunological cross reactivity of fungal and yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase.. . the plasma membrane h+ atpases from fungi and yeasts have similar catalytic and molecular properties. a structural comparison has been performed using immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies directed toward the kda polypeptide of the plasma membrane h+ atpase from neurospora crassa. a strong cross reactivity is observed between the fungal h+ atpase and the enzyme from the yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe. structural homologies are indicated also by the analysis of the cross reactive peptides originated by proteolytic digestion of neurospora and s. cerevisiae purified enzymes. neither enzyme from these two sources appears to be glycosylated by a highly sensitive concanavalin a affinity assay on blotted proteins. a glycoprotein of mr and pi . , which comigrates with a cell cycle modulated protein on d gel, is present in partially purified preparations of plasma membrane h+ atpase of s. cerevisiae and it is shown to be structurally unrelated to h+ atpase.
