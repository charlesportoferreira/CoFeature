properties of the transcriptional enhancer in saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes end with the sequence c a(ca) , commonly abbreviated as c a. these sequences can function as upstream activators of transcription (uas's) when placed in front of a cyc lacz fusion gene. when c a sequences are placed between the gal, uas and the cyc lacz fusion, the c a uas still functions and the amount of beta galactosidase produced in cells grown on glucose is as much or more than that for cells grown on either glycerol medium, or cells grown on glucose medium containing a plasmid with just the c a uas. these data indicate that the uas is immune from glucose repression from the upstream gal, uas. because c a sequences are bound in vitro by the transcription factor rap, the uas activity of yeast telomere sequences was compared with that of a similar uas from the tightly regulated ribosomal protein gene rpa, which also contains a rap binding site. while transcription from the ribosomal protein gene uas was responsive to cell density, the amount of transcription from the c a uas was nearly the same at all cell densities tested. these data show that the transcriptional activation by c a sequences is not regulated by cell density.
