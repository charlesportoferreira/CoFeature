rapp is a negative regulator of the rap gene.. . the promoter of the rap gene contains four potential binding sites for rapp, located between the uas and the rna initiation site. we have confirmed that three of these sites are recognised by rapp in vitro. different combinations of the three sites were then mutated to abolish rapp binding, and the effect of these mutations on promoter activity was determined. when all three rapp sites were mutated, the activity of the promoter increased by about %, indicating that at least one of the sites is a negative element. analysis of promoters with different combinations of the mutant sites revealed that the ' most site (a) is the principal target for repression. to test the involvement of rapp in controlling rap expression, we have measured transcription of the chromosomal rap gene in a rap wild type strain and two strains containing rapts mutations. at a semi permissive temperature, the rap promoter was more active in the rapts strains than in the rap wild type strain, suggesting that expression of the chromosomal rap gene is greater when the activity of rapp in the cell is compromised. the activities of the wild type promoter, and the promoter with mutations in the three rapp binding sites, were compared in sir, sir, sir and sir mutant strains. in each case, the mutated promoter was significantly more active than the wild type promoter, implying that the repression mechanism is not dependent on any one of the sir gene products.
