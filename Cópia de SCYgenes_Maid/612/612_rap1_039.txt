saccharomyces cerevisiae rap binds to telomeric sequences with spatial flexibility.. . a wide divergence has been detected in the telomeric sequences among budding yeast species. despite their length and homogeneity differences, all these yeast telomeric sequences show a conserved core which closely matches the consensus rap binding sequence. we demonstrate that the rap protein binds this sequence core, without involving the diverged sequences outside the core. in saccharomyces castellii and saccharomyces dairensis specific classes of interspersed variant repeats are present. we show here that a rap binding site is formed in these species by connecting two consecutive bp telomeric repeats. dnase i footprint analyses specify the binding site as the bp sequence ctgggtgtctggg. the rap protein also binds the variant repeats, although with a lowered affinity. however, a split footprint is produced when rap binds a variant repeat where the two half sites of the binding site are separated by an additional nt. this is probably caused by the intervening sequence looping out of the rap dna complex. we suggest that the bipartite subdomain structure of the rap protein allows it to remodel telomeric chromatin, a feature which may be of great relevance for telomeric chromatin assembly and structure in vivo.
