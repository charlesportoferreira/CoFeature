the uas of the yeast gapdh promoter consists of multiple general functional elements including rap and grf binding sites.. . the upstream activating sequence (uas) of tdh, one of three genes encoding glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase in saccharomyces cerevisiae, was characterized by using a series of external and internal deletion mutants of the tdh upstream region. the levels of activation by these deletions of transcription mediated through either the segment of tdh promoter or the segment of adh (alcohol dehydrogenase gene) promoter were quantitatively examined and the region between and was found to be required for full transcriptional activation with either promoter segment. it has been demonstrated that the protein binding site involved in the formation of two dna protein complexes is identical with the consensus rap binding sequence by methylation interference assay. surprisingly, the uas fragment composed of the mer sequence containing exclusively a rap binding sequence showed full activation, suggesting that the rap dependent transcriptional activation is a primary positive control in the tdh gene expression. in addition, a pair of inverted repeat sequences homologous to the binding sequence for grf, another yeast trans acting factor, and directly repeated sequences containing a catcc motif were also found upstream and downstream, respectively, of the rap binding site. deletion analysis suggested that these elements could also function as regulatory elements for transcription.
