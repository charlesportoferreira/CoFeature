isolation and characterization of sge. a yeast gene that partially suppresses the gal mutation in multiple copies.. . recessive mutations of gal in saccharomyces cerevisiae cause pleiotropic defects that include weak fermentation of galactose, alpha specific sterility and slow growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. recent experiments suggest that galp functions as a &quot;co activator&quot; that links transcriptional activators, such as galp and grfp/rapp/tufp, with the basic transcription machinery. in the present experiments we isolated a gene, sge, that suppresses gal for growth on ethidium bromide/galactose agar when the gene was present in two or more copies. the other gal phenotypes were not suppressed by sge in the multiple copy state. multiple copies of sge increased expression of galactose inducible genes in gal yeast, presumably at the level of transcription. when sge was disrupted in wild type yeast, the expression of galactose inducible genes decreased to % of the wild type level, presumably due to effect on transcription. complete dna sequence analysis revealed that sge encodes a predicted protein of amino acids. sge specific mrna of . kilonucleotides was detected by northern analysis along the direction of the open reading frame. the gene mapped near rad, at the right end of chromosome .
