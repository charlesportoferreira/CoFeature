functional analysis of carap, encoding the repressor/activator protein of candida albicans.. . the rap gene (repressor/activator protein ) encodes a transcription factor and telomere binding protein that is essential for viability in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the genome sequence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen candida albicans contains a rap homologue. we generated c. albicans mutants in which both rap alleles were deleted. the deltarap mutants grew as well as the wild type parental strain and formed normal germ tubes and hyphae in response to a variety of inducing conditions. however, under conditions that promote budding yeast growth in the wild type strain, the deltarap mutants formed both yeast and pseudohyphal cells. this phenotype was reverted upon reintroduction of a functional rap copy. our results demonstrate that rap is a non essential gene in c. albicans which is required to repress the formation of pseudohyphae under conditions favouring growth as budding yeast.
