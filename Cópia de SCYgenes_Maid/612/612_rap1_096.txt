rapp and telomere length regulation in yeast.. . telomere length in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is under stringent genetic control such that a narrow length distribution of tg repeats is observed. previous studies have shown that rapp, which binds to the double stranded telomeric repeats, plays a role in regulating repeat length. point mutations in the rapp c terminus often result in a higher average telomere length and deletion of this region causes extreme telomere elongation. we have investigated further the role of rapp in this process. our results suggest that telomere length is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that can sense the number of rapp molecules bound at the chromosome end. this length regulatory mechanism requires two other proteins, rifp and rifp, that interact with each other and with the rapp c terminus. although the same c terminal domain of rapp is also involved in the initiation of telomere position effect (telomeric transcriptional silencing), this rapp function appears to be separate from, and indeed antagonistic to, its role in telomere length regulation.
