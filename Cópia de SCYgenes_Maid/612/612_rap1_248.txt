analysis of the rap protein binding to homogeneous telomeric repeats in saccharomyces castellii.. . the repressor activator protein (rap) plays a role in telomere structure and function ins. cerevisiae. here, the rap homologue was identified and cloned from the budding yeast saccharomyces castellii (scasrap). the scasrap gene encodes a protein of amino acids and shares an overall high degree of similarity with the s. cerevisiae rap (scerrap). we demonstrate that the scasrap is able to complement scerrap in temperature sensitive s. cerevisiae strains and is able to function as a regulator to maintain the original telomere lengths. binding analyses of the e. coli expressed scasrap protein demonstrate that it needs two consecutive telomeric repeats in order to bind the s. castellii telomeric dna sequences, and that it binds adjacent sites having a bp centre to centre spacing. the binding affinity to telomeric dna of several other yeasts is similar to that of scerrapp. however, in contrast to scerrapp, scasrapp was found to bind the human telomeric sequence. moreover, the scasrapp was found to incorporate a variant repeat in its binding to the otherwise homogeneous telomeric dna of s. castellii. this ability to bind various sites differing in dna sequence indicates a high degree of adjustability in the binding of scasrapp to dna. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
