the carboxy termini of sir and rap affect sir localization. evidence for a multicomponent complex required for yeast telomeric silencing.. . the silent information regulatory proteins, sir and sir, and the telomeric repeat binding protein rap are required for the chromatin mediated gene repression observed at yeast telomeric regions. all three proteins are localized by immunofluorescence staining to foci near the nuclear periphery suggesting a relationship between subnuclear localization and silencing. we present several lines of immunological and biochemical evidence that sir, sir, and rap interact in intact yeast cells. first, immunolocalization of sir to foci at the yeast nuclear periphery is lost in rap mutants carrying deletions for either the terminal or amino acids of rap. second, the perinuclear localization of both sir and rap is disrupted by overproduction of the cooh terminus of sir. third, overproduction of the sir cooh terminus alters the solubility properties of both sir and full length sir. finally, we demonstrate that rap and sir coprecipitate in immune complexes using either anti rap or anti sir antibodies. we propose that the integrity of a tertiary complex between sir, sir, and rap is involved in both the maintenance of telomeric repression and the clustering of telomeres in foci near the nuclear periphery.
