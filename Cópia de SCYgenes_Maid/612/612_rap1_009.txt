mutant telomeres inhibit transcriptional silencing at native telomeres of the yeast kluyveromyces lactis.. . we report the identification and characterization of transcriptional silencing at native telomeres in the budding yeast kluyveromyces lactis. we show that k. lactis telomeres are able to repress the transcription of a gene located at the junction between the telomeric repeat tract and the subtelomeric domain. as in saccharomyces cerevisiae, switching between the repressed and derepressed transcriptional states occurs. c terminal truncation of the telomere binding protein rapp, which leads to a regulated alteration in telomere length, reduces telomeric silencing. in addition, telomeric silencing is reduced dramatically in telomerase rna mutants in which telomere length control has been lost. this is consistent with the possibility that the structure of the entire telomere affects the silencing functions exhibited by its internal domain.
