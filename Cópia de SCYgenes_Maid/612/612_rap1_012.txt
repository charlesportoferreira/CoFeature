rapp and other transcriptional regulators can function in defining distinct domains of gene expression.. . barrier elements that are able to block the propagation of transcriptional silencing in yeast are functionally similar to chromatin boundary/insulator elements in metazoans that delimit functional chromosomal domains. we show that the upstream activating sequences of many highly expressed ribosome protein genes and glycolytic genes exhibit barrier activity. analyses of these barriers indicate that binding sites for transcriptional regulators rapp, abfp, rebp, adrp and gcnp may participate in barrier function. we also present evidence suggesting that rapp is directly involved in barrier activity, and its barrier function correlates with local changes in chromatin structure. we further demonstrate that tethering the transcriptional activation domain of rapp to dna is sufficient to recapitulate barrier activity. moreover, targeting the activation domain of adrp or gcnp also establishes a barrier to silencing. these results support the notion that transcriptional regulators could also participate in delimiting functional domains in the genome.
