regulation of telomere length and function by a myb domain protein in fission yeast.. . telomeres, the specialized nucleoprotein structures that comprise the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for complete replication, and regulation of their length has been a focus of research on tumorigenesis. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the protein rapp binds to telomeric dna and functions in the regulation of telomere length. a human telomere protein, htrf (human ttaggg repeat factor) binds the telomere sequence in vitro and localizes to telomeres cytologically, but its functions are not yet known. here we use a genetic screen to identify a telomere protein in fission yeast, tazp (telomere associated in schizosaccharomyces pombe), that shares homology to the myb proto oncogene dna binding domain with htrf. disruption or deletion of the taz+ gene causes a massive increase in telomere length. tazp is required for the repression of telomere adjacent gene expression and for normal meiosis or sporulation. it may be a negative regulator of the telomere replicating enzyme, telomerase, or may protect against activation of telomerase independent pathways of telomere elongation.
