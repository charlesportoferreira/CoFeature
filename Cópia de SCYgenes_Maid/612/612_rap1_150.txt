sequence and promoter analysis of the highly expressed tef gene of the filamentous fungus ashbya gossypii.. . ashbya gossypii carries only a single gene (tef) coding for the abundant translation elongation factor alpha. cloning and sequencing of this gene and deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed an extremely high degree of similarity with the well studied tef genes of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae including promoter upstream activation sequence (uas) elements. the open reading frames in both species are codons long and show .% identity at the dna level and .% identity at the protein level. a short dna segment in the promoter, between nucleotides and upstream of the atg start codon, is essential for high level expression of the a. gossypii tef gene. it carries two sequences, gcccatacat and atccatacat, with high homology to the uasrpg sequence of s. cerevisiae, which is an essential promoter element in genes coding for highly expressed components of the translational apparatus. uasrpg sequences are binding sites for the s. cerevisiae protein tuf, also called rap or grf. in gel retardation with a. gossypii protein extracts we demonstrated specific protein binding to the short tef promoter segment carrying the uasrpg homologous sequences.
