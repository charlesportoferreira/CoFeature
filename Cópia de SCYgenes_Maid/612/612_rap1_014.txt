esc, a nuclear periphery protein required for sir based plasmid anchoring and partitioning.. . a targeted silencing screen was performed to identify yeast proteins that, when tethered to a telomere, suppress a telomeric silencing defect caused by truncation of rap. a previously uncharacterized protein, esc (establishes silent chromatin), was recovered, in addition to well characterized proteins rap, sir, and rad. telomeric silencing was slightly decreased in deltaesc mutants, but silencing of the hm loci was unaffected. on the other hand, targeted silencing by various tethered proteins was greatly weakened in deltaesc mutants. two hybrid analysis revealed that esc and sir interact via a amino acid portion of esc (residues to ) and a carboxyl terminal domain of sir known as pad (residues to ). when tethered to dna, this sir domain confers efficient partitioning to otherwise unstable plasmids and blocks the ability of bound dna segments to rotate freely in vivo. here, both phenomena were shown to require esc. sir protein mediated partitioning of a telomere based plasmid also required esc. fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing green fluorescent protein (gfp) esc showed that the protein localized to the nuclear periphery, a region of the nucleus known to be functionally important for silencing. gfp esc localization, however, was not entirely coincident with telomeres, the nucleolus, or nuclear pore complexes. our data suggest that esc is a component of a redundant pathway that functions to localize silencing complexes to the nuclear periphery.
