multimerization of hspp, a novel heat shock protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae, is dependent on a conserved carboxyl terminal sequence.. . rapp is a transcriptional regulator of saccharomyces cerevisiae, which plays roles in both transcriptional activation and silencing. to identify proteins involved in rapp dependent regulation of transcription, we used the two hybrid system to screen for rapp interacting proteins. two of the clones isolated from this screen encode a truncated protein with homology to small heat shock proteins (hsps). here we present an analysis of this novel s. cerevisiae hsp, which we name hspp. expression of hsp is regulated by a range of stress conditions similar to s. cerevisiae hsp, with which hspp shares most homology. however, hsp expression is more sensitive to increased salt concentration and to starvation and, in contrast to hsp is expressed in unstressed cells. hspp interacts with itself in the two hybrid assay. this interaction is dependent on a hydrophobic region which is conserved among small hsps. using bacterially expressed hspp fusion proteins. we demonstrate that this is a direct interaction. fractionation of yeast protein extracts by size demonstrates that all of the hspp in these extracts is present in complexes with a molecular mass of greater than kda, suggesting that hspp exists in high molecular mass complexes.
