rapp binding sites in the saccharomyces cerevisiae gpd promoter are involved in its response to nacl.. . mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of the osmotically controlled gpd gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated by promoter analysis. the gpd gene encodes nad(+) dependent glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the production of the compatible solute glycerol. by analysis of promoter deletions, we identified a region at nucleotides to , in relation to start of translation, to be of great importance for both basal activity and osmotic induction of gpd. electrophoretic mobility shift and dnase i footprint analyses demonstrated protein binding to parts of this region that contain three consensus sequences for rapp (repressor activator protein ) binding sites. actual binding of rapp to this region was confirmed by demonstrating enhanced electrophoretic mobility of the protein dna complex with extracts containing an n terminally truncated version of rapp. the detected rapp dna interactions were not affected by changes in the osmolarity of the growth medium. specific inactivation of the rapp binding sites by a c to a point mutation in the core of the consensus showed that this factor is a major determinant of gpd expression since mutations in all three putative binding sites for rapp strongly hampered osmotic induction and drastically lowered basal activity. we also show that the rapp binding sites appear functionally distinct; the most distal site (core of the consensus at position ) exhibited the highest affinity for rapp and was strictly required for low salt induction (&lt; or =. m nacl), but not for the response at higher salinities (&gt; or =. m nacl). this indicates tha different molecular mechanisms might be operational for low and high salt responses of the gpd promoter.
