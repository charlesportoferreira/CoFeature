two dna binding factors recognize specific sequences at silencers, upstream activating sequences, autonomously replicating sequences, and telomeres in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . two dna binding factors from saccharomyces cerevisiae have been characterized, grfi (general regulatory factor i) and abfi (ars binding factor i), that recognize specific sequences within diverse genetic elements. grfi bound to sequences at the negative regulatory elements (silencers) of the silent mating type loci hml e and hmr e and to the upstream activating sequence (uas) required for transcription of the mat alpha genes. a putative conserved uas located at genes involved in translation (rpg box) was also recognized by grfi. in addition, grfi bound with high affinity to sequences with the (c a) repeat region at yeast telomeres. binding sites for grfi with the highest affinity appeared to be of the form ' (a/g)(a/c)acccannca(t/c)(t/c) ', where n is any nucleotide. abfi binding sites were located next to autonomously replicating sequences (arss) at controlling elements of the silent mating type loci hmr e, hmr i, and hml i and were associated with ars, ars, and the micron plasmid ars. two tandem abfi binding sites were found between the his and ded genes, several kilobase pairs from any ars, indicating that abfi binding sites are not restricted to arss. the sequences recognized by abfi showed partial dyad symmetry and appeared to be variations of the consensus ' tatcattnnnnacga '. grfi and abfi were both abundant dna binding factors and did not appear to be encoded by the sir genes, whose products are required for repression of the silent mating type loci. together, these results indicate that both grfi and abfi play multiple roles within the cell.
