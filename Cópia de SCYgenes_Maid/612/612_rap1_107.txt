from brca to rap. a widespread brct module closely associated with dna repair.. . inherited mutations in brca predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, but the biological function of the brca protein has remained largely elusive. the recent correspondence of koonin et al. [koonin, e.v., altschul, s.f. and bork, p. () nature genet. , ] has emphasized the potential importance of the brca c terminal region for brca mediated breast cancer suppression, as this domain shows similarities with the c terminal regions of a p binding protein (bp), the yeast rad protein involved in dna repair, and two uncharacterized, hypothetical proteins (kiaa and spacg.). the highlighted domain has been suggested to be the result of an internal duplication, each of the tandem domains being designated as a 'brct domain' (for brca c terminus). sequence analysis using hydrophobic cluster analysis reveals here the presence of copies of the brct domain in different proteins, including, in addition to brca, bp and rad, xrcc, rad, ect, rev, crb, rap, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferases (tdt) and three eukaryotic dna ligases. most of these proteins are known to be involved in dna repair. the brct domain is not limited to the c termini of protein sequences and can be found in multiple copies or in a single copy as in rap and tdt, suggesting that it could well constitute an autonomous folding unit of approx. amino acids.
