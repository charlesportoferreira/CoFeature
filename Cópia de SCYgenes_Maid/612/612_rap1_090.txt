a novel rapp interacting factor, rifp, cooperates with rifp to regulate telomere length in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae rap protein binds with high affinity to sites within the poly(c( )a) tracts at telomeres, where it plays a role in both telomere length regulation and the initiation of telomeric silencing. rapp initiates silencing at telomeres by interacting through its carboxy terminal domain with sirp and sirp, both of which are required for repression. this same domain of rapp also negatively regulates telomere elongation, through an unknown mechanism. we have identified a new rap interacting factor (rifp) that plays a role in telomere length regulation. rifp has considerable functional similarities with a rapp interacting factor (rifp) identified previously. mutations in rif or rif (unlike mutations in the silencing genes sir and sir) result in moderate telomere elongation and improved telomeric silencing. however, deletion of both rif and rif in the same cell results in a dramatic increase in telomere length, similar to that seen with a carboxy terminal truncation of rapp. in addition, overexpression of either rif or rif decreases telomere length, and co overexpression of these proteins can reverse the telomere elongation effect of overexpression of the rapp carboxyl terminus. finally, we show that rifp and rifp can interact with each other in vivo. these results suggest that telomere length regulation is mediated by a protein complex consisting of rifp and rifp, each of which has distinct regulatory functions. one role of rapp in telomere length regulation is to recruit these proteins to the telomeres.
