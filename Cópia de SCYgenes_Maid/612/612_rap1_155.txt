promotion of parallel dna quadruplexes by a yeast telomere binding protein. a circular dichroism study.. . repressor activator protein (rap) has an essential role in the maintenance of yeast telomeres. yeast telomeric dna consists of simple repeated g rich sequences that are bound by rap. we have found that rap, in addition to its known binding activity for double stranded dna, interacts with the g rich strand containing guanine base (g) tetrads. we show here using circular dichroism spectroscopy that rap promotes the formation of one particular type of dna quadruplex, parallel g dna. furthermore, rap is able to bind to both preformed parallel and antiparallel dna quadruplexes. these results have implications for the possible use of dna quadruplexes in telomere telomere association in vivo.
