molecular cloning of the gene for the e alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the e alpha and e beta subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were purified. antibodies raised against these subunits were used to clone the corresponding genes from a genomic yeast dna library in the expression vector lambda gt. the gene encoding the e alpha subunit was unique and localized on a . kb hindiii fragment from chromosome v. the identify of the gene was confirmed in two ways. (a) expression of the gene in escherichia coli produced a protein that reacted with the anti e alpha serum. (b) gene replacement at the . kb hindiii fragment abolished both pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and the production of proteins reacting with anti e alpha serum in haploid cells. in addition, the . kb hindiii fragment hybridized to a set of oligonucleotides derived from amino acid sequences from the n terminal and central regions of the human e alpha peptide. we propose to call the gene encoding the e alpha subunit of the yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pda. screening of the lambda gt library using the anti e beta serum resulted in the reisolation of the rap gene, which was located on chromosome xiv.
