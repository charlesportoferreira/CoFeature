cooperation at a distance between silencers and proto silencers at the yeast hml locus.. . transcriptional repression at the silent yeast mating type loci is achieved through the formation of a particular nucleoprotein complex at specific cis acting elements called silencers. this complex in turn appears to initiate the spreading of a histone binding protein complex into the surrounding chromatin, which restricts accessibility of the region to the transcription machinery. we have investigated long range, cooperative effects between silencers by studying the repression of a reporter gene integrated at the hml locus flanked by various combinations of wild type and mutated silencer sequences. two silencers can cooperate over &gt; bp to repress transcription efficiently. more importantly, a single binding site for either the repressor activator protein (rap), the autonomous replicating sequence (ars) binding factor (abf) or the origin recognition complex (orc) can enhance the action of a distant silencer without acting as a silencer on its own. functional cooperativity is demonstrated using a quantitative assay for repression, and varies with the affinity of the binding sites used. since the repression mechanism is sir dependent, the rap, orc and/or abf proteins bound to distant dna elements may interact to create an interface of sufficiently high affinity such that sir containing complexes bind, nucleating the silent chromatin state.
