telomerase rna template mutations reveal sequence specific requirements for the activation and repression of telomerase action at telomeres.. . telomeric dna is maintained within a length range characteristic of an organism or cell type. significant deviations outside this range are associated with altered telomere function. the yeast telomere binding protein rapp negatively regulates telomere length. telomere elongation is responsive to both the number of rapp molecules bound to a telomere and the rapp centered dna protein complex at the extreme telomeric end. previously, we showed that a specific trinucleotide substitution in the saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase gene (tlc) rna template abolished the enzymatic activity of telomerase, causing the same cell senescence and telomere shortening phenotypes as a complete tlc deletion. here we analyze effects of six single and double base changes within these same three positions. all six mutant telomerases had in vitro enzymatic activity levels similar to the wild type levels. the base changes predicted from the mutations all disrupted rapp binding in vitro to the corresponding duplex dnas. however, they caused two classes of effects on telomere homeostasis. (i) rapid, rad independent telomere lengthening and poor length regulation, whose severity correlated with the decrease in in vitro rapp binding affinity (this is consistent with loss of negative regulation of telomerase action at these telomeres; and (ii) telomere shortening that, depending on the template mutation, either established a new short telomere set length with normal cell growth or was progressive and led to cellular senescence. hence, disrupting rapp binding at the telomeric terminus is not sufficient to deregulate telomere elongation. this provides further evidence that both positive and negative cis acting regulators of telomerase act at telomeres.
