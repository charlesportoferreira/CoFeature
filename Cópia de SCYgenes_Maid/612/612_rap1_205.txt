functional analysis of the promoter of the gene encoding the acidic ribosomal protein l in yeast.. . the gene encoding the acidic ribosomal protein l in yeast is expressed coordinately with other rp genes. the promoter region of this gene harbours binding sites for cp and abf. we demonstrate that the cp site is not involved in the transcription activation of the l gene. rather, the abf site, through deviating from the consensus sequence (rtarynacg), appears to be essential for efficient transcription. replacement of this site by a consensus rap binding site (an rpg box) did not alter the transcriptional yield of the l gene. an additional transcription activating region is present downstream of the abf site. the relevant nucleotide sequence, which is repeated in the l gene promoter, gives rise to complex formation with a yeast protein extract in a bandshift assay. the results indicate that the l gene promoter has a complex architecture.
