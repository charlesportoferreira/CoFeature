ars binding factor binds adjacent to rap at the uass of the yeast glycolytic genes pgk and pyk.. . the uas of the yeast gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) contains several different sequence elements involved in transcriptional activation. these elements include the activator core sequence, which is bound by the rap protein, and three copies of the pentamer sequence ' cttcc '. upstream of the activator core sequence is a region (yfp), identified as the site of a strong dna protein interaction. the yfp region contains the consensus binding site for the factor abf. we have purified the y protein, which binds to the yfp region, to homogeneity. the y protein migrates as a doublet on sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular weight of kda. these properties are similar to those of abf. abf synthesised in vitro bound strongly to the yfp region and formed a gel retardation complex of identical mobility to the complex formed by the y protein. uas of the pyruvate kinase gene (pyk) promoter contains a rap binding site and single copy of the cttcc sequence. we have now identified an abf binding site close to the rap binding site and cttcc sequence in the pyk promoter. this site is strongly bound by abf in vitro. the organisation of the pgk and pyk uass is thus similar to each other and to the transcriptional silencer hmr(e) which also contains these sequences.
