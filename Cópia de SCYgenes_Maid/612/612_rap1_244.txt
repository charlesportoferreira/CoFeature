rap affects the length and heterogeneity of human telomeres.. . telomere length is controlled in part by cis acting negative regulators that limit telomere extension by telomerase. in budding yeast, the major telomere length regulator scrap binds to telomeric dna and acts to inhibit telomere elongation in cis. because the human rap ortholog hrap does not bind to telomeric dna directly but is recruited to telomeres by trf, we examined its role in telomere length control. the data are consistent with hrap being a negative regulator of telomere length, indicating functional conservation. deletion mapping confirmed that hrap is tethered to telomeres through interaction of its c terminus with trf. the telomere length phenotypes of hrap deletion mutants implicated both the brct and myb domain as protein interaction domains involved in telomere length regulation. by contrast, scrap binds to telomeres with its myb domains and uses its c terminus to recruit the telomere length regulators rif and rif. together, our data show that although the role of rap at telomeres has been largely conserved, the domains of rap have undergone extensive functional changes during eukaryotic evolution. surprisingly, hrap alleles lacking the brct domain diminished the heterogeneity of human telomeres, indicating that hrap also plays a role in the regulation of telomere length distribution.
