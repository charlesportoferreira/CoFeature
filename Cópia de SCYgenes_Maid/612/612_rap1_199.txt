c terminal truncation of rap results in the deregulation of telomere size, stability, and function in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna binding protein rap is capable of binding in vitro to sequences from a wide variety of genomic loci, including upstream activating sequence elements, the hml and hmr silencer regions, and the poly(g t) tracts of telomeres. recent biochemical and genetic studies have suggested that rap physically and functionally interacts with the yeast telomere. to further investigate the role of rap at the telomere, we have identified and characterized three intragenic suppressors of a temperature sensitive allele of rap, rap . these telomere deficiency (rapt) alleles confer several novel phenotypes. first, telomere tract size elongates to up to kb greater than sizes of wild type or rap telomeres. second, telomeres are highly unstable and are subject to rapid, but reversible, deletion of part or all of the increase in telomeric tract length. telomeric deletion does not require the rad or rad gene product. third, chromosome loss and nondisjunction rates are elevated to fold above wild type levels. sequencing analysis has shown that each rapt allele contains a nonsense mutation within a discrete region between amino acids and . mobility shift and western immunoblot analyses indicate that each allele produces a truncated rap protein, lacking the c terminal to amino acids but capable of efficient dna binding. these data suggest that rap is a central regulator of both telomere and chromosome stability and define a c terminal domain that, while dispensable for viability, is required for these telomeric functions.
