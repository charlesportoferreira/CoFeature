the saccharomyces cerevisiae helicase rrmp facilitates replication past nonhistone protein dna complexes.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae rrm gene encodes a ' to ' dna helicase. while replication of most of the yeast genome was not dependent upon rrmp, in its absence, replication forks paused and often broke at an estimated discrete sites, including trna genes, centromeres, inactive replication origins, and transcriptional silencers. these replication defects were associated with activation of the intra s phase checkpoint. activation of the checkpoint was critical for viability of rrmdelta cells, especially at low temperatures. each site whose replication was affected by rrmp is assembled into a nonnucleosomal protein dna complex. at trna genes and the silent mating type loci, disruption of these complexes eliminated dependence upon rrmp. these data indicate that the rrmp dna helicase helps replication forks traverse protein dna complexes, naturally occurring impediments that are encountered in each s phase.
