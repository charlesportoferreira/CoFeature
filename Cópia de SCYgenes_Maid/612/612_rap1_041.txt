molecular analysis of uas(e), a cis element containing stress response elements responsible for ethanol induction of the kladh gene of kluyveromyces lactis.. . kladh is a gene of kluyveromyces lactis encoding a mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase activity, which is specifically induced by ethanol and insensitive to glucose repression. in this work, we report the molecular analysis of uas(e), an element of the kladh promoter which is essential for the induction of kladh in the presence of ethanol. uas(e) contains five stress response elements (stres), which have been found in many genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae involved in the response of cells to conditions of stress. whereas kladh is not responsive to stress conditions, the stres present in uas(e) seem to play a key role in the induction of the gene by ethanol, a situation that has not been observed in the related yeast s. cerevisiae. gel retardation experiments showed that stres in the kladh promoter can bind factor(s) under non inducing conditions. moreover, we observed that the rap binding site present in uas(e) binds klrapp.
