a rap interacting protein involved in transcriptional silencing and telomere length regulation.. . the yeast rap protein is a sequence specific dna binding protein that functions as both a repressor and an activator of transcription. rap is also involved in the regulation of telomere structure, where its binding sites are found within the terminal poly(c a) sequences. previous studies have indicated that the regulatory function of rap is determined by the context of its binding site and, presumably, its interactions with other factors. using the two hybrid system, a genetic screen for the identification of protein protein interactions, we have isolated a gene encoding a rap interacting factor (rif). strains carrying gene disruptions of rif grow normally but are defective in transcriptional silencing and telomere length regulation, two phenotypes strikingly similar to those of silencing defective raps mutants. furthermore, hybrid proteins containing raps missense mutations are defective in an interaction with rif in the two hybrid system. taken together, these data support the idea that the raps phenotypes are attributable to a failure to recruit rif to silencers and telomeres and suggest that rif is a cofactor or mediator for rap in the establishment of a repressed chromatin state at these loci. by use of the two hybrid system, we have isolated a mutation in rif that partially restores the interaction with raps mutant proteins.
