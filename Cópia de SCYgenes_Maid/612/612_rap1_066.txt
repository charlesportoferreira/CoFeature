kluyveromyces lactis his transcriptional regulation. similarities and differences to saccharomyces cerevisiae his gene.. . sequence analysis of the kluyveromyces lactis his (klhis) gene promoter reveals relevant differences in comparison to the saccharomyces cerevisiae his homologous gene. among them are the absence of a rap binding site and the presence of only three putative gcn binding consensus sites instead of the five described in the s. cerevisiae promoter. since these factors are implicated in the general control, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the klhis gene under conditions of amino acid starvation and discovered that the mechanisms previously described for s. cerevisiae his regulation and related to general control are not functional in k. lactis. the expression analysis of the klhis gene under phosphate starvation or high adenine supply shows that factors, such as bas or bas, involved in the basal control may also operate in a different way in k. lactis. interestingly, and also in contrast to the his regulation in s. cerevisiae, we found domains for nit like and yeast ap like binding sequences. northern analyses showed transcriptional activation under ammonia starvation and oxidative stress.
