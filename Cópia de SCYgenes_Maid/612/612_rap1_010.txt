integrating regulatory motif discovery and genome wide expression analysis.. . we propose motif regressor for discovering sequence motifs upstream of genes that undergo expression changes in a given condition. the method combines the advantages of matrix based motif finding and oligomer motif expression regression analysis, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity. motif regressor is particularly effective in discovering expression mediating motifs of medium to long width with multiple degenerate positions. when applied to saccharomyces cerevisiae, motif regressor identified the rox and yap motifs from roxp and yapp overexpression experiments, respectively; predicted that gcnp may have increased activity in yap deletion mutants; reported a group of motifs (including gcn, pho, met, stre, usr, rap, ma, and mb) that may mediate the transcriptional response to amino acid starvation; and found all of the known cell cycle regulation motifs from expression microarrays over two cell cycles.
