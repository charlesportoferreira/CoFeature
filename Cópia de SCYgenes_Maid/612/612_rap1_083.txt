the role of sas, an acetyltransferase homologue of saccharomyces cerevisiae, in silencing and orc function.. . silencing at the cryptic mating type loci hml and hmr of saccharomyces cerevisiae requires regulatory sites called silencers. mutations in the rap and abf binding sites of the hmr e silencer (hmra e**) cause the silencer to be nonfunctional, and hence, cause derepression of hmr. here, we have isolated and characterized mutations in sas as second site suppressors of the silencing defect of hmra e**. silencing conferred by the removal of sas (sas delta) depended upon the integrity of the ars consensus sequence of the hmr e silencer, thus arguing for an involvement of the origin recognition complex (orc). restoration of silencing by sas delta required orc and orc, but not sir or rap. furthermore, sas delta suppressed the temperature sensitivity, but not the silencing defect of orc and orc . moreover, sas delta had opposing effects on silencing of hml and hmr. the putative sas protein bears similarities to known protein acetyltransferases. several models for the role of sas in silencing are discussed.
