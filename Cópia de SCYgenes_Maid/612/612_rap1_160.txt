evidence that a complex of sir proteins interacts with the silencer and telomere binding protein rap.. . the maintenance of transcriptional silencing at hm mating type loci and telomeres in yeast requires the sir, sir, and sir proteins, none of which appear to be dna binding proteins. here we show that sir and sir interact with a carboxy terminal domain of the silencer, telomere, and uas binding protein rap. we identified sir and sir in a two hybrid screen for rap interacting factors and showed that sir interacts both with itself and with sir. the interaction between rap and sir can be observed in vitro in the absence of other yeast proteins. consistent with the notion that native sir proteins interact with the rap carboxyl terminus, we show that mutation of the endogenous sir and sir genes increases transcriptional activation by lexa/rap hybrids. to test the importance of the rap sir interaction for silencing, we identified mutations in the rap carboxyl terminus that either diminish or abolish this interaction. when introduced into the native rap protein, these mutations cause corresponding defects in silencing at both hmr and telomeres. we propose that rap acts in the initiation of transcriptional silencing by recruiting a complex of sir proteins to the chromosome via protein protein interactions. these data are consistent with a model in which sir and sir play a structural role in the maintenance of silent chromatin and indicate that their action is initiated at the silencer itself.
