identification of uas elements and binding proteins necessary for derepression of saccharomyces cerevisiae fructose , bisphosphatase.. . fructose , bisphosphatase is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis and the fbp gene is not transcribed during growth with glucose. genetic analysis indicated a positive regulation of fbp expression after exhaustion of glucose. by linker deletion analysis, two upstream activation sites (uas and uas) were localized and the respective uas binding factors (dap i and dap ii for derepression activating protein) were identified by gel retardation. uas and uas span about bp each, and are separated by approximately bp. both uas sites act synergistically. although uas showed some similarities to the dna binding consensus for the general yeast activator rap, competition experiments and deae chromatography proved that dap i and rap correspond to different proteins. gel retardation by dap i depended on carbon sources and did not occur in cells growing logarithmically with glucose, whereas a strong retardation signal was obtained with ethanol grown cells. the present results suggest that dap i and dap ii are the final regulatory elements for glucose derepression.
