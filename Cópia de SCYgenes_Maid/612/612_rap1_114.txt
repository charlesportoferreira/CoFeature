genetic analysis of rapp/sirp interactions in telomeric and hml silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have identified three sir suppressors of the telomeric silencing defects conferred by missense mutations within the rapp c terminal tail domain (aa ). each sir suppressor was also capable of suppressing a rap allele (rap ), which deletes the aa c terminal tail domain, but none of the suppressors restored telometric silencing to a amino acid truncation allele. these data suggest a rapp site for sirp association between the two truncation points (aa ). in sir suppressor strains lacking the rapp c terminal tail domain, the presence of a second intragenic mutation within the raps domain (aa ), enhanced silencing fold. these data suggest a competition between sirp and factors that interfere with silencing for association in the raps domain. rap strains containing both wild type sirp and either of the sir suppressor proteins displayed a fold increase in telomeric silencing over rap strains carrying either sirp suppressor in the absence of wild type sirp. we propose that this telomere specific synergism is mediated in part through stabilization of rapp/sirp telometric complexes by sirp sirp interactions.
