proline biosynthesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. molecular analysis of the pro gene, which encodes gamma glutamyl kinase.. . the pro gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the amino acid protein gamma glutamyl kinase (atp.l glutamate phosphotransferase, ec ...), which catalyzes the first step in proline biosynthesis. amino acid sequence comparison revealed significant homology between the yeast and escherichia coli gamma glutamyl kinases throughout their lengths. four close matches to the consensus sequence for gcn protein binding and one close match to the rap protein binding site were found in the pro upstream region. the response of the pro gene to changes in the growth medium was analyzed by measurement of steady state mrna levels and of beta galactosidase activity encoded by a pro lacz gene fusion. pro expression was not repressed by exogenous proline and was not induced by the presence of glutamate in the growth medium. although expression of the pro gene did not change in response to histidine starvation, both steady state pro mrna levels and beta galactosidase activities were elevated in a gcd strain and reduced in a gcn strain. in addition, a pro bradytrophic strain became completely auxotrophic for proline in a gcn strain background. these results indicate that pro is regulated by the general amino acid control system.
