isolation of a candida glabrata homologue of rap, a regulator of transcription and telomere function in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . to study the function of rap, an essential gene involved in the regulation of transcriptional activation, silencing and the telomere function in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated a candida glabrata gene that complements the growth defect of a s. cerevisiae rap conditional mutant. the dna sequence of the cloned gene, which we designated cgrap, predicted a bp open reading frame encoding a amino acid protein with an overall identity of % and a similarity of % to rapp from s. cerevisiae. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
