rap. a protean regulator in yeast.. . the yeast protein rap is a sequence specific dna binding protein that binds to many promoters, to two elements that silence mating type genes, and to [(c) a]n tracts at telomeres. rap is essential for cell viability and can function as either an activator or a repressor of transcription, depending upon the context of its binding site. recent experiments suggest that its function may be determined by different sets of protein protein interactions at promoters and silencers. at the ends of chromosomes, rap plays an important role in both silencing (telomere position effect) and telomere structure.
