the multifunctional transcription factors abfp, rapp and rebp are required for full transcriptional activation of the chromosomal pgk gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have identified two new transcription factor binding sites upstream of the previously defined uas within the phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk) gene promoter in saccharomyces cerevisiae. these sites are bound in vitro by the multifunctional factors cpfp and rebp. we have generated targeted deletions of rapp, abfp and rebp binding sites in the promoter of the chromosomal copy of the pgk gene. northern blot analysis confirmed that most pgk promoter activity is mediated through the rapp binding site. however, significant effects are also mediated through both the rebp and abfp sites. in contrast, when the promoter is present on a high copy number plasmid, both the abfp and rebp sites play no role in transcriptional activation. the role of cpfp was examined using a cpf null strain. cpfp was found to have little if any, effect on activation of either the chromosomal or plasmid borne pgk gene.
