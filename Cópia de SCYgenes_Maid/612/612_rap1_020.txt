activator specific recruitment of tfiid and regulation of ribosomal protein genes in yeast.. . in yeast, tfiid strongly associates with nearly all ribosomal protein (rp) promoters, but a taf independent form of tbp preferentially associates with other active promoters. rp promoters are regulated in response to growth stimuli, in most cases by a rap containing activator. this rap dependent activator is necessary and sufficient for tfiid recruitment, whereas other activators do not efficiently recruit tfiid. tafs are recruited to rp promoters even when tbp and other general transcription factors are not associated, suggesting that tfiid recruitment involves a direct activator taf interaction. most rp promoters lack canonical tata elements, and they are preferentially activated by the rap containing activator. these results demonstrate activator specific recruitment of tfiid in vivo, and they suggest that tfiid recruitment is important for coordinate expression of rp genes.
