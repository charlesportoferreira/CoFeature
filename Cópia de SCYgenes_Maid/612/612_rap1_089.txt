ndjp, a meiotic telomere protein required for normal chromosome synapsis and segregation in yeast.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ndj (nondisjunction) encodes a protein that accumulates at telomeres during meiotic prophase. deletion of ndj (ndjdelta) caused nondisjunction, impaired distributive segregation of linear chromosomes, and disordered the distribution of telomeric rapp, but it did not affect distributive segregation of circular plasmids. induction of meiotic recombination and the extent of crossing over were largely normal in ndjdelta cells, but formation of axial elements and synapsis were delayed. thus, ndjp may stabilize homologous dna interactions at telomeres, and possibly at other sites, and it is required for a telomere activity in distributive segregation.
