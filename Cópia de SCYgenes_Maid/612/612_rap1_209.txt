the promoter of saccharomyces cerevisiae fba gene contains a single positive upstream regulatory element.. . the glycolytic enzyme fructose , bisphosphate aldolase is encoded by the fba gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. transcription of aldolase gene is not regulated by glucose and high levels of expression have been observed also during growth on nonfermentable carbon source. a fba.lacz gene fusion was constructed and a deletion analysis demonstrated the presence of a unique cis acting positive upstream element (uas) required for high levels of fba expression. this element is located between positions and upstream of the aldolase open reading frame and it contains sequences known to constitute the binding sites for the multifunctional proteins rap and abfi and two ttcc motifs.
