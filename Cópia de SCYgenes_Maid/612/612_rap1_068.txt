dot links silencing and cell growth in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . transcriptional silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at specific loci and is mediated by a multiprotein complex that includes rapp and the sir proteins. we studied the function of a recently identified gene, dot, that disrupts silencing when overexpressed. dot encodes an ubiquitin processing protease (hydrolase) that is primarily located in the nucleus. by two hybrid analysis, the amino terminal third of dotp interacts with the silencing protein sirp. cells lacking dot exhibited reduced silencing and a corresponding decrease in the level of sirp. together, these findings suggest that dotp regulates silencing by acting on sirp. in strains with several auxotrophic markers, loss of dot ubiquitin hydrolase activity also results in a slow growth defect. the defect can be partially suppressed by mutations in a subunit of the s proteasome, suggesting that dotp has the ability to prevent ubiquitin mediated degradation. furthermore, wild type sir, sir, and sir are required for full manifestation of the growth defect in a dot strain, indicating that the growth defect is caused in part by a silencing related mechanism. we propose that dotp helps to restrict the location of silencing proteins to a limited set of genomic loci.
