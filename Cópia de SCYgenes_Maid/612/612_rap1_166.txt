in vitro identification of a protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae that interacts specifically with the g rich dna strand of the telomere.. . the telomeres of saccharomyces cerevisiae consist of a repeated g t(gt) dna sequence that forms a complex with proteins. to date only the rap protein has been shown to bind to the simple sequences in yeast telomeric dna, as well as to non telomeric regulatory sites. we have used synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, both double and single stranded, to identify specific yeast telomeric proteins in a partially purified yeast extract. using the gel shift assay, we detected a binding activity that is stable at high ionic strength and that recognizes specifically the g rich protrusion of a double stranded synthetic yeast telomere, as well as the g rich single strand. this is the first evidence of a purely telomeric protein in that it binds to the single stranded telomeric protrusion of the yeast chromosome.
