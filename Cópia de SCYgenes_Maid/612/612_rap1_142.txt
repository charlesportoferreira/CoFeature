transcription activation of yeast ribosomal protein genes requires additional elements apart from binding sites for abfp or rapp.. . all ribosomal protein (rp) gene promoters from saccharomyces cerevisiae studied so far contain either (usually two) binding sites for the global gene regulator rapp or one binding site for another global factor, abfp. previous analysis of the rps and rpl gene promoters suggested that apart from the abf binding site, additional cis acting elements play a part in transcription activation of these genes. we designed a promoter reconstruction system based on the beta glucuronidase reporter gene to examine the role of the abf binding site and other putative cis acting elements in promoting transcription. an isolated abf binding site turned out to be a weak activating element. a t rich sequence derived from the rps proximal promoter was found to be stronger, but full transcription activation was only achieved by a combination of these elements. both in the natural rpl promoter and in the reconstituted promoter, a rap binding site could functionally replace the abf binding site. characteristic rp gene nutritional control of transcription, evoked by a carbon source upshift or by nitrogen re feeding to nitrogen starved cells, could only be mediated by the combined abf (or rap) binding site and t rich element and not by the individual elements. these results demonstrate that abfp and rapp do not activate rp genes in a prototypical fashion, but rather may serve to potentiate transcription activation through the t rich element.
