plant interstitial telomere motifs participate in the control of gene expression in root meristems.. . the promoters of arabidopsis eefa genes contain a telomere motif, the telo box, associated with an activating sequence, the tef box. database searches indicated the presence of telo boxes in the ' region of numerous genes encoding components of the translational apparatus. by using several promoter constructs we demonstrate that the telo box is required for the expression of a beta glucoronidase gene in root primordia of transgenic arabidopsis. this effect was observed when a telo box was inserted upstream or downstream from the transcription initiation site, and occurred in synergy with the tef box. these results clearly indicate that interstitial telomere motifs in plants are involved in control of gene expression. south western screening of a lambdazap library with a double stranded arabidopsis telomere motif resulted in characterization of a protein related to the conserved animal protein puralpha. the possibility of a regulation process similar to that achieved by the rapp in saccharomyces cerevisiae is discussed.
