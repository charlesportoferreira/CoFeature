sum , a dominant suppressor of sir mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae, increases transcriptional silencing at telomeres and hm mating type loci and decreases chromosome stability.. . transcriptional silencing in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at hml and hmr mating type loci and telomeres and requires the products of the silent information regulator (sir) genes. recent evidence suggests that the silencer and telomere binding protein rapp initiates silencing by recruiting a complex of sir proteins to the chromosome, where they act in some way to modify chromatin structure or accessibility. a single allele of the sumgene (sum ) which restores silencing at hm loci in strains mutant for any of the four sir genes was identified a number of years ago. however, conflicting genetic results and the lack of other alleles of sum made it difficult to surmise the wild type function of sum or the manner in which the sum mutation restores silencing in sir mutant strains. here we report the cloning and characterization of the sum gene and the sum mutant allele. our results indicate that sum is an unusual altered function mutation that can bypass the need for sir function in hm silencing and increase repression at telomeres. a sum deletion mutation has only minor effects on silencing in sir strains and does not restore silencing in sir mutants. in addition to its effect on transcriptional silencing, the sum mutation (but not a sum deletion) increases the rate of chromosome loss and cell death. we suggest several speculative models for the action of sum in silencing based on these and other data.
