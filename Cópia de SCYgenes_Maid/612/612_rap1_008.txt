transcription of genes encoding trans acting factors required for rrna maturation/ribosomal subunit assembly is coordinately regulated with ribosomal protein genes and involves rap in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we demonstrate that the genes encoding trans acting factors essential for pre rrna processing/ribosomal subunit assembly are responsive to various kinds of stresses such as heat shock, nitrogen deprivation and a secretory defect, in coordination with ribosomal protein genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rap mutation, which produces the c terminally truncated protein of a transcriptional factor rapp, affects transcriptional repression of the trans acting factor genes due to a secretory defect as shown previously for both ribosomal protein and rrna genes.
