identification of sas and sas, two genes that regulate silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromatin mediated silencing inactivates transcription of the genes at the hml and hmr cryptic mating type loci and genes near telomeres. mutations in the rapp and abfp binding sites of the hmr e silencer (hmra e**) result in a loss of silencing at hmr. we characterized a collection of mutations that restore the alpha mating phenotype to matalpha hmra e** strains. these mutations defined three complementation groups, two new groups and one group that corresponded to the previously identified sas gene. we cloned the genes that complemented members of the new groups and identified two previously uncharacterized genes, which we named sas and sas. neither sas nor sas was required for viability. null alleles of sas and sas restored sir dependent silencing at hmr, establishing that each is a regulator of silencing. null alleles of sas and sas bypassed the role of the abfp binding site of the hmr e silencer but not the role of the acs or rapp binding site. previous analysis indicated that sas is homologous to a human gene that is a site of recurring translocations involved in acute myeloid leukemia. similarly, sas is a member of a gene family that included two human genes that are the sites of recurring translocations involved in acute myeloid leukemia.
