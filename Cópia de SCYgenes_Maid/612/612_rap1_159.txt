mutational analysis defines a c terminal tail domain of rap essential for telomeric silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . alleles specifically defective in telomeric silencing were generated by in vitro mutagenesis of the yeast rap gene. the most severe phenotypes occur with three mutations in the c terminal amino acids. two of the alleles are nonsense mutations resulting in truncated repressor/activator protein (rap) species lacking the c terminal amino acids; the third allele is a missense mutation within this region. these alleles define a novel amino acid region, termed the c terminal tail domain, that is essential for telomeric and hml silencing. using site directed mutagenesis, an amino acid region (amino acids ) that is essential for telomeric silencing has been localized within this domain. further characterization of these alleles has indicated that the c terminal tail domain also plays a role in telomere size control. the function of the c terminal tail in telomere maintenance is not mediated through the rap interacting factor rif. rap alleles defective in both the c terminal tail and rif interaction domains have additive effects on telomere length. overproduction of sir, a dose dependent enhancer of telomeric silencing, suppresses the telomeric silencing, but not length, phenotypes of a subset of c terminal tail alleles. in contrast, an allele that truncates the terminal amino acids of rap is refractory to sir overproduction. these results indicate that the c terminal tail domain is required for sir dependent enhancement of telomeric silencing. these data also suggest a distinct set of c terminal requirements for telomere size control and telomeric silencing.
