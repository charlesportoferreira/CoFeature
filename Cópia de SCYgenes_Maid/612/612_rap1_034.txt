multiple interactions in sir protein recruitment by rapp at silencers and telomeres in yeast.. . initiation of transcriptional silencing at mating type loci and telomeres in saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the recruitment of a sir// (silent information regulator) protein complex to the chromosome, which occurs at least in part through its association with the silencer and telomere binding protein rapp. sirp and sirp are structural components of silent chromatin that can self associate, interact with each other, and bind to the amino terminal tails of histones h and h. we have identified a small region of sirp between amino acids and that is necessary and sufficient for association with the carboxyl terminus of rapp but not required for sir complex formation or histone binding. sir mutations that delete this region cause a silencing defect at hmr and telomeres. however, this impairment of repression is considerably less than that displayed by rapp carboxy terminal truncations that are defective in sirp binding. this difference may be explained by the ability of the rapp carboxyl terminus to interact independently with sirp, which we demonstrate by in vitro binding and two hybrid assays. significantly, the rapp sirp two hybrid interaction does not require sirp and is abolished by mutation of the carboxyl terminus of rapp. we propose that both sirp and sirp can directly and independently bind to rapp at mating type silencers and telomeres and suggest that rapp mediated recruitment of sir proteins operates through multiple cooperative interactions, at least some of which are redundant. the physical separation of the rapp interaction region of sirp from parts of the protein required for sir complex formation and histone binding raises the possibility that rapp can participate directly in the maintenance of silent chromatin through the stabilization of sir complex nucleosome interactions.
