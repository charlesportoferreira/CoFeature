telomeres, not the end of the story.. . transcription in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals is subject to chromosomal position effects that result in heritable and variegated patterns of gene expression. two recent studies have employed a reversible protein dna crosslinking method to identify the structural components of heterochromatin in budding yeast. the results show that a complex containing the proteins rap, sirp, sirp and sirp is physically associated with nucleosomes at telomere proximal regions, but that the repressive chromatin structure extended by sirp overexpression has a different composition.
