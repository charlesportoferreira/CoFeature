trf is a dimer and bends telomeric dna.. . trf is a mammalian telomeric protein that binds to the duplex array of ttaggg repeats at chromosome ends. trf has homology to the dna binding domain of the myb family of transcription factors but, unlike most myb related proteins, trf carries one rather than multiple myb type dna binding motifs. here we show that trf binds dna as a dimer using a large conserved domain near the n terminus of the protein for trf trf interactions. dimerization was observed both in a complex with dna and in the yeast two hybrid assay. trf dimers were found to require both myb repeats for the formation of a stable complex with dna, indicating a parallel between the dna binding mode of trf and other myb related proteins. trf was found to have a number of biochemical similarities to rapp, a distantly related dna binding protein that functions at telomeres in yeast. rapp and trf both require two myb motifs for dna binding and both factors bind along their cognate telomeric sequences without showing strong cooperative interactions between adjacent proteins. furthermore, trf was found to bend its telomeric site to an angle of degrees. since rapp similarly distorts telomeric dna, we propose that dna bending is important for the function of telomeres in yeast and mammals.
