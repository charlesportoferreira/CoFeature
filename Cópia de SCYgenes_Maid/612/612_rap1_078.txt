functional characterization of the n terminus of sirp.. . silent information regulator is an essential component of the saccharomyces cerevisiae silencing complex that functions at telomeres and the silent mating type loci, hmr and hml. we show that expression of the n and c terminal encoding halves of sir in trans partially complements the mating defect of the sir null allele, suggesting that the two domains have distinct functions. we present here a functional characterization of these domains. the n terminal domain (sirn) increases both the frequency and extent of telomere proximal silencing when expressed ectopically in sir+ yeast strains, although we are unable to detect interaction between this domain and any known components of the silencing machinery. in contrast to its effect at telomeres, sirn overexpression derepresses transcription of reporter genes inserted in the ribosomal dna (rdna) array. immunolocalization of sirn gfp and sirp suggests that sirn directly antagonizes nucleolar sirp, releasing an rdna bound population of sirp so that it can enhance repression at telomeres. overexpression of the c terminal domain of either sirp or sirp has a dominant negative effect on telomeric silencing. in strains overexpressing the c terminal domain of sirp, elevated expression of either full length sirp or sirn restores repression and the punctate pattern of sirp and rapp immunostaining. the similarity of sirn and sirp overexpression phenotypes suggests that sirn acts as an allosteric effector of sirp, either enhancing its interactions with other silencing components or liberating the full length protein from nonfunctional complexes.
