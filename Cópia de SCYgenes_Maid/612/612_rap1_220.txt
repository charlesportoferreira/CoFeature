rap protein interacts with yeast telomeres in vivo. overproduction alters telomere structure and decreases chromosome stability.. . the protein encoded by the rap gene of s. cerevisiae binds in vitro to a consensus sequence occurring at a number of sites in the yeast genome, including the repeated sequence c a(ca) found at yeast telomeres. we present two lines of evidence for the in vivo binding of rap protein at telomeres. first, rap is present in telomeric chromatin and second, alterations in the level of rap protein affect telomere length. the length changes seen with under and overexpression of rap are consistent with the interpretation that rap binding to telomeres protects them from degradation. unexpectedly, overproduction of the rap protein was also shown to decrease greatly chromosome stability, suggesting that rap mediates interactions that have a more global effect on chromosome behavior than simply protecting telomeres from degradation. such interactions may involve telomere associations both with other telomeres and/or with structural elements of the nucleus.
