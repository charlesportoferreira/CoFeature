c terminal domains of general regulatory factors abfp and rapp in saccharomyces cerevisiae display functional similarity.. . abfp and rapp are global regulatory factors which play an essential role in the transcription activation of yeast ribosomal protein genes. this functional link prompted us to investigate whether these factors may be functionally interchangeable. we focused on the indispensable c terminal portions of both factors and performed mutual domain swaps. the functional capacity of the resulting hybrid proteins was subsequently examined using yeast strains conditionally expressing either the abf or the rap gene. both the abfp rapp and the rapp abfp fusion proteins were found to be able to complement the growth defect of the respective strains. furthermore, abfp and rapp are both able to promote transcription of a reporter gene through a combination of the respective binding site and a t rich promoter element. these data strongly suggest that the c terminal domains of abfp and rapp have, at least partially, identical functions. finally, a deletion analysis of the so far largely uncharacterized c terminal domain of abfp was performed, which revealed that two regions of amino acids can perform all essential abfp functions.
