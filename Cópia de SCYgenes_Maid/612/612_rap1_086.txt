the yeast silent information regulator sirp anchors and partitions plasmids.. . circular plasmids containing telomeric tg arrays or the hmr e silencer segregate efficiently between dividing cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. subtelomeric x repeats augment the tg partitioning activity by a process that requires the sir, sir, and sir genes, which are also required for silencer based partitioning. here we show that targeting sirp to dna directly via fusion to the bacterial repressor lexa confers efficient mitotic segregation to otherwise unstable plasmids. the sirp partitioning activity resides within a amino acid region (residues to ) which precedes the coiled coil dimerization motif at the extreme carboxy end of the protein. using a topology based assay, we demonstrate that the partitioning domain also retards the axial rotation of lexa operators in vivo. the anchoring and partitioning properties of lexa sirp chimeras persist despite the loss of the endogenous sir genes, indicating that these functions are intrinsic to sirp and not to a complex of sir factors. in contrast, inactivation of the sirp interacting protein rapp reduces partitioning by a lexa sirp fusion. the data are consistent with a model in which the partitioning and anchoring domain of sirp (pad domain) attaches to a nuclear component that divides symmetrically between cells at mitosis; dna linked to sirp by lexa serves as a reporter of protein movement in these experiments. we infer that the segregation behavior of telomere and silencer based plasmids is, in part, a consequence of these sirp mediated interactions. the assays presented herein illustrate two novel approaches to monitor the intracellular dynamics of nuclear proteins.
