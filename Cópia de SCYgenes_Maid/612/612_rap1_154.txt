yeast intragenic transcriptional control. activation and repression sites within the coding region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae lpd gene.. . though widely recognized in higher eukaryotes, the regulation of saccharomyces cerevisiae genes transcribed by rna polymerase ii by proteins that bind within the coding sequence remains largely speculative. we have shown for the lpd gene, encoding lipoamide dehydrogenase, that the coding sequence between + and + activated gene expression of an lpd.lacz fusion by up to sixfold in the presence of the upstream promoter. this downstream region, inserted upstream of a promoterless cyc.lacz fusion, activated gene expression in a carbon source dependent manner by a factor of to , independent of orientation. deletion and mutational analysis identified two downstream activation sites (das and das) and two downstream repressor sites (drs and drs) that influence the rate of lpd transcription rather than mrna degradation or translation. activation from the das region (positions + to +), encompassing a cdei like element, is twofold under derepressive conditions. activation from das (+ to +), a cre like motif, is fold for both repressed and derepressed states. drs, a pair of adjacent and opposing abf sites (+ to +), is responsible for a . to fold repression of transcription, depending on the carbon source. drs requires the concerted action of drs (a rap motif at position +) for repression of transcription only when the gene is induced. gel mobility shift analysis and in vitro footprinting have shown that proteins bind in vitro to these downstream elements.
