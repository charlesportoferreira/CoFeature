purification and characterization of a nuclear factor which binds specifically to the upstream activation sequence of saccharomyces cerevisiae enolase gene.. . the nuclear factor which specifically binds to the upstream activation sequence (uas) of the enolase gene (eno) of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified by sequence specific affinity chromatography. the purified factor gave two closely migrated bands at kda on sds/page. the binding activities were eluted from a gel filtration column at molecular masses of kda and kda, suggesting a dimeric and a tetrameric assembly of the factor in the native form. the region protected by the purified factor against deoxyribonuclease i digestion contained the sequence acccaaacacc which is highly similar to the consensus sequence present in the ' flanking region of the ribosomal protein genes (rpg box). we also identified the other factor specific to the eno uas which gave a single peak at a molecular mass of kda in gel filtration. we suggest the existence of multiple binding to the eno uas by at least two factors. one is the factor which we purified with a molecular mass of kda on sds/page and the other is the factor like rap protein which generally recognizes the rpg box like sequence.
