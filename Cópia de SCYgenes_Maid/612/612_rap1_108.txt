an abfp c terminal region lacking transcriptional activation potential stimulates a yeast origin of replication.. . although it has been demonstrated that eukaryotic cellular origins of dna replication may harbor stimulatory elements that bind transcription factors, how these factors stimulate origin function is unknown. in saccharomyces cerevisiae , the transcription factor abfp stimulates origin function of ars and ars . in the results presented here, an analysis of abfp function has been carried out utilizing lexa(bd) abfp fusion proteins and an ars derivative harboring lexa dna binding sites. a minimal region which stimulates origin function mapped to amino acids within the c terminus of abfp. when tested for transcriptional activation of a lacz reporter gene, the same lexa(bd) abfp fusion protein had negligible transcriptional activation potential. therefore, stimulation of ars may occur independently of a transcriptional activation domain. it has been previously observed that the galp, rapp dna binding sites and the lexa galp fusion protein can replace the role of abfp in stimulating ars . here we show that the stimulatory function of abfp at ars cannot be replaced by these alternative dna binding sites and the potent chimeric transcriptional activator lexa(bd) gal(ad)p . hence, these results strongly suggest that the abfp stimulation of replication may differ for ars and ars , and imply specificity in the abfp/ars relationship.
