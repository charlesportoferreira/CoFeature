a multi component upstream activation sequence of the saccharomyces cerevisiae glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter.. . the majority of the activation potential of the saccharomyces cerevisiae tdh gene promoter is contained within nucleotides to (relative to the translation initiation codon). an upstream activation sequence (uas) in this region has been characterized by in vitro and in vivo assays and demonstrated to be composed of two small, adjacent dna sequence elements. the essential determinant of this upstream uas is a general regulatory factor (grf) binding site at nucleotides to . a synthetic dna element comprising this sequence, or an analogue in which two of the degenerate nucleotides of the grf site consensus sequence were altered, activated ' deleted tdh and cyc promoters. the second dna element of the uas is a bp sequence which is conserved in the promoters of several yeast genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and occurs at positions to of the tdh promoter. this dna sequence represents a novel promoter element. it contains no uas activity itself, yet potentiates the activity of a grf uas. the potentiation of the grf uas by this element occurs when placed upstream from the tata box of either the tdh or cyc promoters. the characteristics of this element (termed gpe for grf site potentiator element) indicate that it represents a binding site for a different yeast protein which increases the promoter activation mediated by the grf protein. site specific deletion and promoter reconstruction experiments suggest that the entire activation potential of the to region of the tdh gene promoter may be accounted for by a combination of the grf site and the gpe.
