multiple factors bind the upstream activation sites of the yeast enolase genes eno and eno. abfi protein, like repressor activator protein rap, binds cis acting sequences which modulate repression or activation of transcription.. . binding sites for three distinct proteins were mapped within the upstream activation sites (uas) of the yeast enolase genes eno and eno. sequences that overlapped the uas elements of both enolase genes bound a protein which was identified as the product of the rap regulatory gene. sequences within the uas element of the eno gene bound a second protein which corresponded to the abfi (autonomously replicating sequence binding factor) protein. a protein designated ebf (enolase binding factor) bound to sequences which overlapped the uas element in eno. there was a good correlation among all of the factor binding sites and the location of sequences required for uas activity identified by deletion mapping analysis. this observation suggested that the three factors play a role in transcriptional activation of the enolase genes. uas elements which bound the rap protein or the abfi protein modulated glucose dependent induction of eno and eno expression. the abfi binding site in eno overlapped sequences required for uas activity in wild type strains and for repression of eno expression in strains carrying a null mutation in the positive regulatory gene gcr. these latter results showed that the abfi protein, like the rap protein, bound sequences required for positive as well as negative regulation of gene expression. these observations strongly suggest that the biological functions of the rap and abfi proteins are similar.
