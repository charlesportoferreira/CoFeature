action of a rap carboxy terminal silencing domain reveals an underlying competition between hmr and telomeres in yeast.. . rap is a sequence specific dna binding protein in yeast that can either repress or activate transcription. previous studies have demonstrated a direct role for rap in silencing at hm mating type loci and telomeres. here, we show that a small carboxy terminal domain of rap is sufficient to establish repression when fused to the gal dna binding domain (gbd) and targeted to mutated hmr silencers containing gal dna binding sites. silencing by gbd/rap hybrids, like normal silencing at hmr, requires the trans acting factors sir, sir, and sir. however, gbd/rap mediated silencing is independent of sir, whose product is normally required for the establishment of repression at hmr. targeted silencing also displays an unusual response to silencing defective raps mutations. the incorporation of a raps missense mutation into gbd/rap hybrids can improve targeted silencing, yet wild type gbd/rap hybrids fail to establish repression in strains in which the endogenous rap locus carries a raps mutation. in addition, we find that telomeric silencing is increased in raps strains. we propose that the raps mutation creates an hmr specific silencing defect by shifting a balance between silencing at hmr and telomeres in favor of telomeric silencing. this balance is regulated by telomere length and by interactions between the rap carboxyl terminus and both rif and sir proteins. in support of this model, we show that abnormally long telomeres antagonize silencing at hmr and a raps hybrid protein displays a strengthened interaction with sir in a two hybrid assay.
