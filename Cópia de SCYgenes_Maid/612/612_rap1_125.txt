silencing of genes at nontelomeric sites in yeast is controlled by sequestration of silencing factors at telomeres by rap protein.. . rapp binds to silencer elements and telomeric repeats in yeast, where it appears to initiate silencing by recruiting sirp and sirp to the chromosome through interactions with its carboxy terminal domain. sirp and sirp interact in vitro with histones h and h and are likely to be structural components of silent chromatin. we show that targeting of these sir proteins to the chromosome is sufficient to initiate stable silencing either at a silent mating type locus lacking a functional silencer element or at a telomere in a strain in which the rapp carboxy terminal silencing domain has been deleted. silencing by sir protein targeting can also be initiated at a telomere proximal site (adh), but is much weaker at an internal chromosomal locus (lys). strikingly, deletion of the rapp silencing domain, which abolishes telomeric silencing, improves targeted silencing at lys by both sirp and sirp, while weakening the silencing activity of these proteins at or near a telomere. this effect may result from the release of sir proteins from the telomeres, thus increasing their effective concentration at other chromosomal sites. we suggest that telomeres and rapp serve a regulatory role in sequestering sir proteins at telomeres, controlling silencing at other loci in trans and preventing indiscriminate gene silencing throughout the genome.
