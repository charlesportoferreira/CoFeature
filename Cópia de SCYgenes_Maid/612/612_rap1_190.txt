saccharomyces telomeres assume a non nucleosomal chromatin structure.. . the chromatin structures of the telomeric and subtelomeric regions on chromosomal dna molecules in saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed using micrococcal nuclease and dnase i. the subtelomeric repeats x and y' were assembled in nucleosomes. however, the terminal tracts of c a repeats were protein protected in a particle larger than a nucleosome herein called a telosome. the proximal boundary of the telosome was a dnase i hypersensitive site. this boundary between the telosome and adjacent nucleosomes was completely accessible to escherichia coli dam methylase when this enzyme was expressed in yeast, whereas a site bp internal to the telomeric repeats was relatively inaccessible. telosomes could be cleaved from chromosome ends with nuclease and solubilized as protein dna complexes. immunoprecipitation of chromosomal telosomes with antiserum to the rap protein indicated that rap was one component of isolated telosomes. thus, the termini of chromosomal dna molecules in yeast are assembled in a non nucleosomal structure encompassing the entire terminal c a tract. this structure is separated from adjacent nucleosomes by a region of dna that is highly accessible to enzymes.
