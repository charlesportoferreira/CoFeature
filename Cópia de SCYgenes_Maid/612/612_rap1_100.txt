ribosomal protein l is the product of grc, a homolog of the putative tumor suppressor qm in s. cerevisiae.. . genes encoding members of the highly conserved qm family have been identified in eukaryotic organisms from yeast to man. results of previous studies have suggested roles for qm in control of cell growth and proliferation, perhaps as a tumor suppressor, and in energy metabolism. we identified recessive lethal alleles of the saccharomyces cerevisiae qm homolog grc that increased gcn expression when present in multiple copies. these alleles encode truncated forms of the yeast qm protein grcp. using a functional epitope tagged grc allele, we localized grcp to a s fraction that contained the large ribosomal subunit. two dimensional gel analysis of highly purified yeast ribosomes indicated that grcp corresponds to s ribosomal protein l. this identification is consistent with the predicted physical characteristics of eukaryotic qm proteins, the highly biased codon usage of grc, and the presence of putative rapp binding sites in the ' sequences of the yeast grc gene.
