identification of the dna damage responsive element of rnr and evidence that four distinct cellular factors bind it.. . the rnr gene encodes the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the pathway for the production of the deoxyribonucleotides needed for dna synthesis. transcription of this gene is induced approximately fold in response to environmental stimuli that damage dna or block dna replication. deletion and subcloning analysis identified two, and possibly three, upstream activating sequences (uas) and one repressing (urs) element in the rnr regulatory region. a base pair (bp) fragment from this region was found to be necessary for proper regulation of rnr and to be capable of conferring dna damage inducibility upon a heterologous promoter. this fragment contained both positively and negatively acting sequences. four dna binding factors interacted with the rnr regulatory region. one factor was identified as the grf protein, the product of the rap gene. grf bound to the uas element of rnr, which was found to be directly adjacent to the bp fragment. uas activity was repressed by the bp fragment. three other factors bound to the bp fragment; one of these factors, rrf, had a second binding site in the rnr promoter. these factors are likely to mediate the response of rnr to dna damage.
