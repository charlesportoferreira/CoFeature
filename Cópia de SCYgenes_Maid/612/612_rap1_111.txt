tethered sirp nucleates silencing at telomeres and internal loci in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . rapp binds to sites embedded within the saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeric tg tract. previous studies have led to the hypothesis that rapp may recruit sirp and sirp associating factors to the telomere. to test this, we tethered sirp adjacent to the telomere via lexa binding sites in the rap mutant that truncates the rapp c terminal amino acids thought to contain sites for sirp association. tethering of lexa sirp adjacent to the telomere is sufficient to restore telomeric silencing, indicating that sirp can nucleate silencing at the telomere. tethering of lexa sirp or the lexa sirp(no) gain of function protein to a telomeric lexa site hyperrepresses an adjacent ade gene in wild type cells. hence, sirp recruitment to the telomere is limiting in telomeric silencing. in addition, lexa sirp(no) hyperrepresses telomeric silencing when tethered to a subtelomeric site . kb from the telomeric tract. this hyperrepression is dependent on the c terminus of rapp, suggesting that subtelomeric lexa sirp(n) can interact with rapp associated factors at the telomere. we also demonstrate that lexa sirp or lexa sirp(n) tethered in cis with a short tract of telomeric tg sequences is sufficient to confer silencing at an internal chromosomal position. internal silencing is enhanced in rap strains. we propose that sequestration of silencing factors at the telomere limits the efficiency of internal silencing.
