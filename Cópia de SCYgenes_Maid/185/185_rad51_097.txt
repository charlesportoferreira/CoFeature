zip provides a link between recombination enzymes and synaptonemal complex proteins.. . in budding yeast, absence of the meiosis specific zip protein (also known as cst) causes synaptonemal complex formation to be delayed and incomplete. the zip protein colocalizes with zip at discrete foci on meiotic chromosomes, corresponding to the sites where synapsis initiates. observations suggest that zip promotes synapsis by recruiting the zip protein to chromosomes and/or stabilizing the association of zip with chromosomes. zip interacts with a number of gene products involved in meiotic recombination, including proteins that act at both early (mre, rad, and rad) and late (msh and msh) steps in the exchange process. we speculate that zip is a component of recombination nodules and serves to link the initiation of synapsis to meiotic recombination.
