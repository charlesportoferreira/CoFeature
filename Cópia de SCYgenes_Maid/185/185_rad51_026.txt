the mnd protein forms a complex with hop to promote homologous chromosome pairing and meiotic double strand break repair.. . the hop mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae arrests in meiosis with extensive synaptonemal complex (sc) formation between nonhomologous chromosomes. a screen for multicopy suppressors of a hop ts allele identified the mnd gene. the mnd null mutant arrests in meiotic prophase, with most double strand breaks (dsbs) unrepaired. a low level of mature recombinants is produced, and the rad protein accumulates at numerous foci along chromosomes. sc formation is incomplete, and homolog pairing is severely reduced. the mnd protein localizes to chromatin throughout meiotic prophase, and this localization requires hop. unlike recombination enzymes such as rad, mnd localizes to chromosomes even in mutants that fail to initiate meiotic recombination. the hop and mnd proteins coimmunoprecipitate from meiotic cell extracts. these results suggest that hop and mnd work as a complex to promote meiotic chromosome pairing and dsb repair. the identification of hop and mnd homologs in other organisms suggests that the function of this complex is conserved among eukaryotes.
