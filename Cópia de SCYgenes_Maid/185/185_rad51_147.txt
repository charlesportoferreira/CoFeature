the involvement of cellular recombination and repair genes in rna mediated recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we previously demonstrated that a reverse transcript of a cellular reporter gene (his ai) can serve as the donor for gene conversion of a chromosomal his deltamsci target sequence, and that this process requires the yeast recombination gene rad. in this study, we examine the involvement of other recombination and repair genes in rna mediated recombination, and gain insight into the nature of the recombination intermediate. we find that mutation of the mitotic reca homologs rad, rad, and rad increases the rate of rna mediated recombination relative to the wild type, and that these gene functions are not required for rna mediated gene conversion. interestingly, rad is required for rna mediated gene conversion of chromosomal his deltamsci sequences, suggesting that the cdna intermediate has a region of nonhomology that must be removed during recombination with target sequences. the observation that both rad and rad are required for rna mediated gene conversion of chromosomal but not plasmid sequences indicates a clear difference between these two pathways of homologous rna mediated recombination.
