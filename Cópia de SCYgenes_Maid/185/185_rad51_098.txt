the rad paralog radb promotes homologous recombinational repair.. . the highly conserved saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein plays a central role in both mitotic and meiotic homologous dna recombination. seven members of the rad family have been identified in vertebrate cells, including rad, dmc, and five rad related proteins referred to as rad paralogs, which share to % sequence identity with rad. in chicken b lymphocyte dt cells, we generated a mutant with radb/radl, a member of the rad family, knocked out. radb( / ) cells are viable, although spontaneous chromosomal aberrations kill about % of the cells in each cell cycle. radb deficiency impairs homologous recombinational repair (hrr), as measured by targeted integration, sister chromatid exchange, and intragenic recombination at the immunoglobulin locus. radb( / ) cells are quite sensitive to the cross linking agents cisplatin and mitomycin c and mildly sensitive to gamma rays. the formation of damage induced rad nuclear foci is much reduced in radb( / ) cells, suggesting that radb promotes the assembly of rad nucleoprotein filaments during hrr. these findings show that radb is important for repairing various types of dna lesions and maintaining chromosome integrity.
