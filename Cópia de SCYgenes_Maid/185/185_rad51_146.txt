homologous recombination, but not dna repair, is reduced in vertebrate cells deficient in rad.. . rad plays a pivotal role in double strand break (dsb) repair and genetic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae, where mutation of this gene leads to extreme x ray sensitivity and defective recombination. yeast rad and rad interact, as do their human homologues, which stimulates rad mediated dna strand exchange in vitro, suggesting that rad and rad act cooperatively. to define the role of rad in vertebrates, we generated rad( / ) mutants of the chicken b cell line dt. surprisingly, rad( / ) cells were not hypersensitive to dna damages induced by gamma irradiation, methyl methanesulfonate, or cis platinum(ii)diammine dichloride (cisplatin). intrachromosomal recombination, measured by immunoglobulin gene conversion, and radiation induced rad nuclear focus formation, which is a putative intermediate step during recombinational repair, occurred as frequently in rad( / ) cells as in wild type cells. targeted integration frequencies, however, were consistently reduced in rad( / ) cells, showing a clear role for rad in genetic recombination. these findings reveal striking differences between s. cerevisiae and vertebrates in the functions of rad and rad.
