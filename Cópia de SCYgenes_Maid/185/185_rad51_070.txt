rad partially substitutes for the rad paralog xrcc in maintaining chromosomal integrity in vertebrate cells.. . yeast rad dna repair mutants exhibit pronounced radiation sensitivity and a defect in homologous re combination (hr), whereas vertebrate cells lacking rad exhibit a nearly normal phenotype. bio chemical studies show that both yeast rad and rad (rad paralogs) stimulate dna strand exchange mediated by rad. these findings raise the possibility that rad paralogs may compensate for lack of rad in vertebrate cells, explaining the absence of prominent phenotypes for rad deficient cells. to test this hypothesis, using chicken dt cells, we generated conditional mutants deficient in both rad and xrcc, which is one of the five vertebrate rad paralogs. surprisingly, the rad xrcc double mutant cells were non viable and exhibited extensive chromosomal breaks, whereas rad and xrcc single mutants grew well. our data reveal an overlapping (but non reciprocal) role for rad and xrcc in repairing dna double strand breaks. the present study shows that rad can play an important role in hr repair by partially substituting for a rad paralog.
