homologous pairing activity of the human dna repair proteins xrcc.radc.. . the human xrcc protein is involved in the repair of damaged dna through homologous recombination, in which homologous pairing is a key step. the rad protein is believed to be the only protein factor that promotes homologous pairing in recombinational dna repair in mitotic cells. in the brain, however, rad expression is extremely low, whereas xrcc, a human homologue of saccharomyces cerevisiae rad that activates the rad dependent homologous pairing with the yeast rad protein, is expressed. in this study, a two hybrid analysis conducted with the use of a human brain cdna library revealed that the major xrcc interacting protein is a rad paralog, radc/radl. the purified xrcc.radc complex, which shows apparent . stoichiometry, was found to catalyze the homologous pairing. although the activity is reduced, the radc protein alone also catalyzed homologous pairing, suggesting that radc is a catalytic subunit for homologous pairing. the dna binding activity of xrcc.radc was drastically decreased in the absence of xrcc, indicating that xrcc is important for the dna binding of xrcc.radc. electron microscopic observations revealed that xrcc.radc and radc formed similar filamentous structures with circular single stranded dna.
