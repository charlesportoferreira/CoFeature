cold sensitive rad alleles of yeast.. . we have characterized two rad mutations that are cold sensitive for growth on mms agar. the mutations change residues and , respectively, in the amino acid open reading frame. neither mutation has a profound effect on mitotic crossing over or on gene conversion. one has a severe deficiency in sporulation at all temperatures, while the other has a partial deficiency and reduced spore viability. both mutants are retarded in growth on mms agar by a high copy plasmid expressing rad.
