isolation and characterization of radc, a new human member of the rad family of related genes.. . the yeast and human rad genes encode strand transfer proteins that are thought to be involved in both recombinational repair of dna damage and meiotic recombination. in yeast, the rad family of related proteins also includes rad, rad and dmc. in mammalian cells, five genes in this family have been identified (hsrad, xrcc, xrcc, radb/hrec and hsdmc), and here we report the isolation of the sixth member, radc. radc was originally identified by a computer screen of the est database. a full length approximately . kb cdna clone has been isolated that encodes a protein of aa, having a % aa identity with other human rad family members. radc includes a previously mapped sequenced tagged site location near the end of chromosome q. the radc transcript is expressed in various human tissues, with highest level of expression in testis, followed by heart muscle, spleen and prostate. yeast two hybrid experiments indicate that the radc protein binds to two other members of the rad protein family (xrcc and radb) but not to itself. these findings suggest that radc may function similarly to the yeast rad or rad proteins, rather than as a rad functional homolog.
