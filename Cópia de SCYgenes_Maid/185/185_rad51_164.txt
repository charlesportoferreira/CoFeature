cell cycle dependent protein expression of mammalian homologs of yeast dna double strand break repair genes rad and rad.. . recently, human and rodent homologs of yeast repair genes rad and rad have been identified and proposed to play roles in dna double strand break (dsb) repair. in this study, cell cycle dependent expression of human and rodent rad and rad proteins was monitored using two approaches. first, flow cytometric measurements of dna content and immunofluorescence were used to determine the phase specific levels of rad and rad protein expression in irradiated and control populations. the expression of both proteins was lowest in g/g, increased in s and reached a maximum in g/m. no difference was found in the whole cell level of rad or rad protein expression between gamma irradiated and control cell populations. second, cell cycle dependent protein expression was confirmed by western analysis of populations synchronized in g, g and g phases. analysis of v, a hamster equivalent of scid, indicates that the protein level increases of rad and rad from g to g/s/g do not require dna pk.
