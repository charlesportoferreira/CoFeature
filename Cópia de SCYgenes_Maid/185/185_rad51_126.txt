proteolytic cleavage of hsrad during apoptosis.. . the rad gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for genetic recombination and recombinational repair of dna strand breaks. in higher eukaryotes rad is essential for embryonic development, and is involved in cell proliferation and dna repair. here we show that human rad (hsrad) is proteolytically cleaved during apoptosis in two t lymphocyte cell lines, jurkat and pfi . apoptosis was induced by camptothecin or anti fas monoclonal antibody (anti fas mab). hsrad was cleaved with similar kinetics as human poly(adp ribose) polymerase (hsparp) after treatment with either agent. the time course of cleavage coincided with internucleosomal dna fragmentation. the hsrad fragments observed in apoptotic cells were identical to those generated from in vitro translated (ivt) hsrad exposed to activated jurkat s extract in a cell free system. in each case, cleavage of hsrad was abolished by acetyl asp glu val asp aldehyde (ac devd cho). however, cleavage of ivt hsrad could not be demonstrated using purified caspase , or to , and the identity of the responsible protease thus remains to be determined. in summary, we have shown that hsrad belongs to a group of repair proteins, including parp and dna dependent protein kinase, which are specifically cleaved during the execution phase of apoptosis.
