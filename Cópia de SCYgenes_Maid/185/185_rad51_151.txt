rab and rab/mouse brca. proteins that specifically interact with the rad protein.. . the human rad protein is a homologue of the bacteria reca and yeast rad proteins that are involved in homologous recombination and dna repair. rad interacts with proteins involved in recombination and also with tumor suppressor proteins p and breast cancer susceptibility gene (brca). we have used the yeast two hybrid system to clone murine cdna sequences that encode two rad associated molecules, rab and rab. rab encodes the c terminal portion of mouse brca, the homologue of the second breast cancer susceptibility gene protein in humans, demonstrating an in vitro association between rad and brca. rab is a novel gene product that also interacts with rad in vitro. to detect rad interactions in vivo, we developed a transient nuclear focus assay that was used to demonstrate a complete colocalization of rab with rad in large nuclear foci.
