the rad rad complex interacts with rad and replication protein a.. . the rad gene is essential for homology dependent repair of double strand breaks in saccharomyces cerevisiae. rad forms complexes with rad, replication protein a (rpa) or rad and its presence is essential for the formation of rad rad rad and rpa rad rad complexes. the n terminal region of rad, which is required for self interaction to form a ring structure, is required for interaction with rad. rad also shows self interaction suggesting the formation of heteromeric and homomeric rings of rad and rad. in wild type cells, we propose the rad rad rad complex is involved in conservative recombination events, including gene conversion and reciprocal recombination, whereas the rad rad complex participates in single strand annealing.
