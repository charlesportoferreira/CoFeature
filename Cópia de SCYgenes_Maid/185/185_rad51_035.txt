molecular cloning and characterization of rad like genes from arabidopsis thaliana.. . homologous recombination is an essential process for the maintenance and variability of the genome. in eukaryotes, the rad epistasis group proteins serve the main role for meiotic recombination and/or homologous recombinational repair. rad like proteins, such as rad and rad in yeast, play a role in assembly or stabilization of multimeric rad that promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions. we cloned two rad like genes named atxrcc and atradc from arabidopsis thaliana. both atxrcc and atradc expressed two alternatively spliced transcripts, and atradc produced two different sizes of isoforms, a long (atradcalpha) and a short one (atradcbeta). the predicted protein sequences of these genes showed characteristic features of the reca/rad family; especially the amino acids around the atp binding motifs were well conserved. the transcripts of atxrcc and atradc were detected in various tissues, with the highest level of expression in flower buds. expression of both genes was induced by gamma ray irradiation. the results of yeast two hybrid assays suggested that arabidopsis rad family proteins form a complex, which could participate in meiotic recombination and/or homologous recombinational repair.
