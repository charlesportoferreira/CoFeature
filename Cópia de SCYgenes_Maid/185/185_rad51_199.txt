targeted disruption of the rad gene leads to lethality in embryonic mice.. . the mouse rad gene is a mammalian homologue of the escherichia coli reca and yeast rad genes, both of which are involved in homologous recombination and dna repair. to elucidate the physiological role of rad protein, the gene was targeted in embryonic stem (es) cells. mice heterozygous for the rad null mutation were intercrossed and their offspring were genotyped. there were no homozygous (rad / ) pups among neonates examined but a few rad / embryos were identified when examined during the early stages of embryonic development. doubly knocked out es cells were not detected under conditions of selective growth. these results are interpreted to mean that rad protein plays an essential role in the proliferation of cell. the homozygous rad null mutation can be categorized in cell autonomous defects. pre implantational lethal mutations that disrupt basic molecular functions will thus interfere with cell viability.
