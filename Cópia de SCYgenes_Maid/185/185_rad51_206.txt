genetic evidence for different rad dependent intrachromosomal recombination pathways in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mutations in the reca like genes rad and rad reduce the frequency of gene conversion/reciprocal exchange between inverted repeats fold. however, they enhance the frequency of deletions between direct repeats fold. these induced deletions are rad and rad dependent. on the basis of these results it is proposed that there are several rad dependent pathways of recombination. the recombinational repair pathway of gene conversion/reciprocal exchange dependent on rad and rad; a rad and rad dependent pathway exclusively responsible for deletions that are induced in rad and rad mutants; and finally, it is possible that the gene conversion/reciprocal exchange events observed in rad and rad strains represent another rad dependent recombination pathway of gene conversion/reciprocal exchange that does not require rad and rad functions. it is also shown that the rad excision repair gene is involved in long gene conversion tracts in homologous recombination between inverted repeats, as previously observed for rad. finally, an analysis of meiotic recombination reveals that deletions are induced in meiosis fold above mitotic levels, similar to intrachromosomal gene conversion/reciprocal exchange, and that, in contrast to intrachromosomal meiotic gene conversion (% association), intrachromosomal meiotic gene conversion is not preferentially associated with reciprocal exchange ( % of association).
