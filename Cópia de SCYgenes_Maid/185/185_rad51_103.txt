the essential functions of human rad are independent of atp hydrolysis.. . genetic recombination and the repair of double strand dna breaks in saccharomyces cerevisiae require rad, a homologue of the escherichia coli reca protein. in vitro, rad binds dna to form an extended nucleoprotein filament and catalyzes the atp dependent exchange of dna between molecules with homologous sequences. vertebrate rad is essential for cell proliferation. using site directed mutagenesis of highly conserved residues of human rad (hrad) and gene targeting of the rad locus in chicken dt cells, we examined the importance of rad's highly conserved atp binding domain. mutant hrad incapable of atp hydrolysis (hradk r) binds dna less efficiently than the wild type but catalyzes strand exchange between homologous dnas. hrad does not need to hydrolyze atp to allow vertebrate cell proliferation, form nuclear foci, or repair radiation induced dna damage. however, cells expressing hradk r show greatly reduced targeted integration frequencies. these findings show that atp hydrolysis is involved in dna binding by hrad and suggest that the extent of dna complexed with hrad in nucleoprotein influences the efficiency of recombination.
