investigation of the stability of yeast rad mutant proteins uncovers post translational and transcriptional regulation of radp.. . we investigated the stability of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein to learn how a cell controls its quantity and longevity. we measured the cellular levels of wild type and mutant forms of radp when expressed from the rad promoter and the half lives of the various forms of radp when expressed from the gal promoter. the wild type protein has a half life of min. rad mutations variably affect the cellular levels of the protein products, and these levels correlate with the measured half lives. while missense mutations in the n terminus of the protein drastically reduce the cellular levels of the mutant proteins, two mutations one a deletion of amino acids and the other a missense mutation of residue increase the cellular level and half life more than twofold. these results suggest that radp is subject to post translational regulation. proteasomal mutations have no effect on radp half life but increase the amount of rad message. in contrast to radp, the half life of radp is &gt; hr, and rad expression is unaffected by proteasomal mutations. these differences between radp and radp suggest differential regulation of two proteins that interact in recombinational repair.
