interhomolog bias during meiotic recombination. meiotic functions promote a highly differentiated interhomolog only pathway.. . meiotic recombination occurs preferentially between homologous nonsister chromatids rather than between sisters, opposite to the bias of mitotic recombinational repair. we have examined formation of joint molecule recombination intermediates (jms) between homologs and between sisters in yeast strains lacking the meiotic chromosomal protein red, the meiotic reca homolog dmc, and/or mitotic reca homolog(s), rad, rad, and rad. mutant phenotypes imply that most meiotic recombination occurs via an interhomolog only pathway along which interhomolog bias is established early, prior to or during double strand break (dsb) formation, and then enforced, just at the time when dsbs initiate jm formation. a parallel, less differentiated pathway yields intersister and, probably, a few interhomolog events. coordinate action of mitotic reca homologs as one functional unit, two functions of red, and an interhomolog interaction function of dmc are also revealed.
