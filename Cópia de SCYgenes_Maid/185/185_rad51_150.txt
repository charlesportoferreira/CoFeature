identification of a novel human rad homolog, radb.. . the highly conserved saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein functions in both mitotic and meiotic homologous recombination and in double strand break repair. screening of the public cdna sequence database for rad like genes led to the identification of a partial sequence from a breast tissue library present in the i.m.a.g.e. (integrated molecular analysis of genes and their expression) collection. an extended bp cdna clone encoding an open reading frame of amino acids was isolated. this clone showed significant amino acid identity with other human rad homologs. the new homolog, named radb, was mapped to human chromosome q q. using a panel of human hamster somatic cell hybrids and fluorescence in situ hybridization. northern blot analysis demonstrated that radb mrna is widely expressed and most abundant in tissues active in recombination. functions associated with known rad homologs suggest a role for radb in meiotic recombination and/or recombinational repair.
