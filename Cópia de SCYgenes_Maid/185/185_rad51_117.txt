characterization of the role played by the rad gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae in ectopic recombination.. . the rad group of genes in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae controls the repair of dna damage by a recombinational mechanism. despite the growing evidence for physical and biochemical interactions between the proteins of this repair group, mutations in individual genes show very different effects on various types of recombination. the rad gene encodes a protein with similarity to radp which plays a role in the repair of damage caused by ionizing radiation. in the present study we have examined the role played by the rad protein in mitotic ectopic recombination and analyzed the genetic interactions with other members of the repair group. we found that radp plays a role in ectopic gene conversion that depends on the presence of radp but is independent of the function of the reca homologue radp and of the rad protein. the rad gene product also participates in the rad dependent pathway of recombination between direct repeats. we propose that radp may act in a salvage mechanism that operates when the rad filament is not functional.
