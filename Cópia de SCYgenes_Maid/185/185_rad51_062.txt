sgs is required for telomere elongation in the absence of telomerase.. . in s. cerevisiae, mutations in genes that encode telomerase components, such as the genes est, est, est, and tlc, result in the loss of telomerase activity in vivo. two telomerase independent mechanisms can overcome the resulting senescence. type i survival is characterized by amplification of the subtelomeric y' elements with a short telomere repeat tract at the terminus. type ii survivors arise through the abrupt addition of long tracts of telomere repeats. both mechanisms are dependent on rad and on either rad or rad. we show here that the telomere elongation pathway in yeast (type ii) is dependent on sgs, the yeast homolog of the gene products of werner's (wrn) and bloom's (blm) syndromes. survival in the absence of sgs and est is dependent upon rad and rad but not rad. we propose that the recq family helicases are required for processing a dna structure specific to eroding telomeres.
