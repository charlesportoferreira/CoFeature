genetic and molecular characterization of neurospora crassa mus . a gene involved in recombinational repair.. . a newly isolated mutant, mus , of neurospora crassa was found to be highly sensitive to a wide variety of mutagens, including uv light, methyl methanesulfonate, nitroquinoline oxide, n methyl n' nitro n nitrosoguanidine and tert butyl hydroperoxide. this mutant was originally isolated as a mutant that could not grow on medium containing histidine. meiosis and sporulation were defective in homozygous crosses between mus haploids. the mus gene is located on the right arm of lgii, between fl and trp . analyses of epistasis between mus and other mutations that cause defects in dna repair indicated that the mus gene belongs to the same dna repair group as mei , which is the neurospora homolog of the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene rad. the double mutant carrying mus and uvs mutations was lethal. the mus gene was cloned by complementation of the mms sensitive phenotype of the mus mutant. the gene contained an open reading frame of bp and did not contain any introns. the molecular weight of the predicted mus gene product was . kda. computer analyses revealed that the mus protein has significant homology to mrep, which is known to be involved in recombinational repair in s. cerevisiae. the level of mus transcripts increased significantly within min of treatment with uv or mms and then gradually decreased. the role of mus protein in recombinational repair is discussed.
