genetic requirements for the targeted integration of agrobacterium t dna in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . agrobacterium tumefaciens delivers transferred dna (t dna) into cells of plants and yeast. in plants, the t dna integrates at random positions into the genome by non homologous recombination (nhr), whereas in yeast the t dna preferably integrates by homologous recombination (hr). here we show that t dna integration by hr in yeast requires the recombination/repair proteins rad and rad, but not rad, mre, xrs, yku and lig. in the hr events a remarkable shift from insertion type events to replacement events was observed in rad, mre and xrs mutants. residual integration in the rad mutant occurred predominantly by hr, whereas in the rad mutant integration occurred exclusively by nhr. previously, we found that t dna integration by nhr is abolished in a yku mutant. thus, rad and yku are the key regulators of t dna integration, channeling integration into either the hr or nhr pathway.
