association of brca with rad in mitotic and meiotic cells.. . brca immunostaining reveals discrete, nuclear foci during s phase of the cell cycle. human rad, a homolog of bacterial reca, behaves similarly. the two proteins were found to colocalize in vivo and to coimmunoprecipitate. brca residues alone formed rad containing complexes in vitro. rad is also specifically associated with developing synaptonemal complexes in meiotic cells, and brca and rad were both detected on asynapsed (axial) elements of human synaptonemal complexes. these findings suggest a functional interaction between brca and rad in the meiotic and mitotic cell cycles, which, in turn, suggests a role for brca in the control of recombination and of genome integrity.
