interaction of rad with atp and mg+ induces a conformational change in rad.. . the presumptive first step in the rad promoted formation of joint molecules is binding of the protein to ssdna in the presence of atp and mg+. in this paper, we report that rad's ability to bind dna is rapidly inactivated when incubated at degrees c but is stabilized by the presence of atp and mg+. although unable to promote binding to dna, atp gamma s also prevents inactivation of rad at degrees c. amp p n p lacks this property, while adp protects partially but only at times higher concentrations than atp. these observations correlate with the dissociation constant of those nucleotides for rad determined by equilibrium dialysis. rad binds atp and atp gamma s with a . stoichiometry and kds of and microm, respectively. the presence of dna significantly increases the affinity of rad for atp, while dna has a smaller effect on the affinity of atp gamma s. competition binding studies show that adp and amp p n p bind with a and fold lower affinity, respectively, than atp. the cd spectrum of rad with negative double minima at around and nm is characteristic of an alpha helical protein. upon binding atp and mg+, the cd spectrum is altered in the regions and nm, changes that are indicative of a more structured state; this change does not occur with rad that has been inactivated at degrees c. we surmise that the active conformation is more resistant to inactivation at elevated temperature. our data suggest that one of the roles of atp and mg+ in rad mediated strand exchange is to induce the proper protein structure for binding the two dna substrates.
