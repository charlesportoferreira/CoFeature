a role for rad in the generation of immunoglobulin gene diversity in rabbits.. . ig vdj genes in rabbit somatically diversify by both hyperpointmutation and gene conversion. to elucidate the mechanism of gene conversion of igh genes, we cloned a rabbit homologue of rad, a gene involved in gene conversion in saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), and tested whether it could complement a yeast rad mutant deficient in recombination repair. we found that rabbit rad partially complemented the defect in switching mating types by gene conversion as well as in dna double strand break repair after gamma irradiation. further, by western blot analysis, we found that levels of rad were higher in appendix derived b lymphocytes of wk old rabbits, a time at which igh genes diversify by somatic gene conversion. we suggest that rad is involved in somatic gene conversion of rabbit ig genes.
