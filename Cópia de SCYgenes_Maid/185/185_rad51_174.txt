mammalian rad protein. a reca homologue with pleiotropic functions.. . during the last years, homologues of e coli reca have been cloned in numerous species including man. these rad proteins share sequence as well as functional homologies with the bacterial protein. human rad (hsrad) is able to catalyze strand exchange in vitro between homologous dnas, but with a lower efficiency compared to that of reca. this suggests the requirement of additional factors. a very interesting feature of rad is its essential role in mouse which could mean that it has gained an essential function in cell growth. the interaction of hsrad with several tumor suppressor genes namely p, brca and brca implies possible role(s) of this protein in tumorigenesis. thus, the continued study of rad should bring important insights not only into homologous recombination mechanisms but also into cell proliferation regulation.
