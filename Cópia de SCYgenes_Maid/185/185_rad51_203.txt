identification and expression of the neurospora crassa mei gene which encodes a protein homologous to rad of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the mei gene of neurospora crassa encodes a homolog of the escherichia coli reca and saccharomyces cerevisiae rad proteins, which are required for recombination and repair of dna double strand breaks. to determine the molecular function of mei protein, anti mei antibody was prepared and used in western blot analysis. the antibody cross reacted only with crude extracts prepared from perithecia, the fruiting bodies of neurospora. the molecular weight of the mei protein was estimated to be kda. transformation experiments showed that a dna fragment longer than previously reported was needed to complement the mei mutation. on sequencing cdna and genomic dna, one open reading frame (orf) was found, which consists of three exons interrupted by two small introns. this orf encoded a mei protein of amino acids, and the inferred mw of kda is in good agreement with the results from western blot analysis. comparisons of mei with other rad homologs indicated that mei protein contains the two conserved core domains (i and ii) generally observed in rad homologs in eukaryotes. northern blot analysis showed that expression of mei was raised remarkably after uv irradiation or methyl methanesulfonate (mms) treatment. the transcript size was . kb and this was also larger than was reported previously.
