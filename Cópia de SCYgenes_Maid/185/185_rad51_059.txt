mediator function of the human radb radc complex in rad/rpa catalyzed dna strand exchange.. . five rad like proteins, referred to as rad paralogs, have been described in vertebrates. we show that two of them, radb and radc, are associated in a stable complex. radb radc complex has ssdna binding and ssdna stimulated atpase activities. we also examined the functional interaction of radb radc with rad and rpa. even though rpa enhances rad catalyzed dna joint formation via removal of secondary structure in the ssdna substrate, it can also compete with rad for binding to the substrate, leading to suppressed reaction efficiency. the competition by rpa for substrate binding can be partially alleviated by radb radc. this recombination mediator function of radb radc is likely required for the assembly of the rad ssdna nucleoprotein filament in vivo.
