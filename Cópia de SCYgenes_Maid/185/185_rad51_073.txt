rad independent break induced replication to repair a broken chromosome depends on a distant enhancer site.. . without the rad strand exchange protein, saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot repair a double strand break (dsb) by gene conversion. however, cells can repair dsbs by recombination dependent, break induced replication (bir). rad independent bir is initiated more than kb from the dsb. repair depends on a bp sequence adjacent to ars, located approximately kb centromere proximal to the dsb, but does not depend on the origin activity of ars. we conclude that the ability of a recombination induced replication fork to copy &gt; kb to the end of the chromosome depends on a special site that enhances assembly of a processive repair replication fork.
