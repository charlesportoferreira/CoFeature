the n terminal dna binding domain of rad promotes rad independent recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rad protein plays a role in both rad dependent and rad independent recombination pathways. we characterized a rad mutant, rad , which lacks the c terminal rad interacting domain, and studied its role in rad independent recombination. the rad mutant is completely defective in mating type switching, but partially proficient in recombination between inverted repeats. we also analyzed the effect of the rad mutant on telomere recombination. yeast cells lacking telomerase maintain telomere length by recombination. the rad mutant is deficient in rad dependent telomere recombination, but is proficient in rad independent telomere recombination. in addition, we examined the roles of other recombination genes in the telomere recombination. the rad independent recombination in the rad mutant is promoted by a paralogue of rad, rad. all components of the rad mre xrs complex are also important, but not essential, for rad independent telomere recombination. interestingly, rad inhibits the rad independent, rad dependent telomere recombination. these findings indicate that rad itself, and more precisely its n terminal dna binding domain, promote an essential reaction in recombination in the absence of rad.
