interaction with rad is indispensable for recombination mediator function of rad.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rad gene is indispensable for homologous recombination and dna repair. rad protein binds dna, anneals complementary ssdna strands, and self associates to form multimeric complexes. moreover, rad physically interacts with the rad recombinase and serves as a mediator in the rad catalyzed dna strand exchange reaction. here, we examine the functional significance of the rad/rad interaction. through a series of deletions, we have identified residues of rad as being indispensable and likely sufficient for its interaction with rad. we have constructed a four amino acid deletion mutation within this region of rad to ablate its interaction with rad. we show that the raddelta mutant protein is defective in the mediator function in vitro even though none of the other rad activities, namely, dna binding, ssdna annealing, and protein oligomerization, are affected. we also show that the sensitivity of the raddelta mutant to ionizing radiation can be complemented by overexpression of rad. these results thus demonstrate the significance of the rad rad interaction in homologous recombination.
