the rad family member, radl, is a dna stimulated atpase that forms a complex with xrcc.. . the rad protein in eukaryotic cells is a structural and functional homolog of escherichia coli reca with a role in dna repair and genetic recombination. several proteins showing sequence similarity to rad have previously been identified in both yeast and human cells. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, two of these proteins, radp and radp, form a heterodimer that can stimulate rad mediated dna strand exchange. here, we report the purification of one of the representatives of the rad family in human cells. we demonstrate that the purified radl protein possesses single stranded dna binding activity and dna stimulated atpase activity, consistent with the presence of &quot;walker box&quot; motifs in the deduced radl sequence. we have identified a protein complex in human cells containing radl and a second rad family member, xrcc. by using purified proteins, we demonstrate that the interaction between radl and xrcc is direct. given the requirements for xrcc in genetic recombination and protection against dna damaging agents, we suggest that the complex of radl and xrcc is likely to be important for these functions in human cells.
