specific interactions between the human rad and rad proteins.. . processing of dna damage by the dna double strand break repair pathway in mammalian cells is accomplished by multiprotein complexes. however, the nature of these complexes and details of the molecular interactions are not fully understood. interaction of the yeast rad and rad proteins plays a crucial role in yeast dna homologous recombination and dna double strand break repair. here, specific interactions between human rad and rad proteins are demonstrated both in vivo, using the yeast two hybrid system and immunoprecipitation of insect cells co infected with rad and rad recombinant viruses, and in vitro, using affinity chromatography with purified recombinant proteins. these results suggest that rad may modulate the catalytic activities of rad protein such as homologous pairing and strand exchange through a direct physical interaction. in addition, the domain in rad that mediates this interaction was determined in vitro and in vivo. the rad interacting region (amino acids ) of the human rad protein shows no homology with the yeast rad protein, indicating that the interaction between rad and rad is species specific.
