assembly of reca like recombinases. distinct roles for mediator proteins in mitosis and meiosis.. . members of the reca family of recombinases from bacteriophage t, escherichia coli, yeast, and higher eukaryotes function in recombination as higher order oligomers assembled on tracts of single strand dna (ssdna). biochemical studies have shown that assembly of recombinase involves accessory factors. these studies have identified a class of proteins, called recombination mediator proteins, that act by promoting assembly of recombinase on ssdna tracts that are bound by ssdna binding protein (ssb). in the absence of mediators, ssb inhibits recombination reactions by competing with recombinase for dna binding sites. here we briefly review mediated recombinase assembly and present results of new in vivo experiments. immuno double staining experiments in saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that rad, the eukaryotic recombinase, can assemble at or near sites containing ssb (replication protein a, rpa) during the response to dna damage, consistent with a need for mediator activity. correspondingly, mediator gene mutants display defects in rad assembly after dna damage and during meiosis, although the requirements for assembly are distinct in the two cases. in meiosis, both rad and rad/ are required, whereas either rad or rad/ is sufficient to promote assembly of rad in irradiated mitotic cells. rad promotes normal amounts of rad assembly in the absence of rad at degrees c but not degrees c, accounting for the cold sensitivity of rad null mutants. finally, we show that assembly of rad is induced by radiation during s phase but not during g(), consistent with the role of rad in repairing the spontaneous damage that occurs during dna replication.
