yeast rad recombinase mediates polar dna strand exchange in the absence of atp hydrolysis.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae rad gene is required for genetic recombination and recombinational repair of dna strand breaks. rad protein has a dna dependent atpase activity, and it catalyzes atp dependent pairing and strand exchange between homologous dna molecules. we show here that the rad arg protein, which is devoid of atpase activity, mediates the pairing and strand exchange reaction upon binding atp. in addition, the wild type rad protein can catalyze pairing and strand exchange in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable atp analogues adenylyl imidodiphosphate and adenosine ' o thiotriphosphate. thus, homologous pairing and the unidirectional transfer of greater than kilobases of dna can occur efficiently without the need for nucleotide hydrolysis. consistent with the results from the biochemical analyses, expression of the rad arg protein in a rad null mutant confers normal cellular resistance to the dna damaging agent methylmethane sulfonate, suggesting that nucleotide binding by rad is sufficient for biological function.
