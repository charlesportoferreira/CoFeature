expression of the human rad gene during the cell cycle in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes.. . the s. cerevisiae rad gene product exerts important functions in meiotic and mitotic recombination, as well as in the repair of dna double strand breaks. we have studied the expression of the human rad (hsrad) gene in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). the hsrad mrna level increased three fold in mitogen stimulated pbls, with a peak in the late s phase. a five fold increase of hsrad protein levels was observed in late g. specific inhibition of dna synthesis with aphidicolin did not block the induction of the hsrad protein, indicating that hsrad expression is independent of dna replication. in contrast, after inhibition of rna synthesis with actinomycin d and protein synthesis with cycloheximide, the hsrad protein level decreased rapidly. taken together, these results indicate that the hsrad gene is transcriptionally regulated in human pbls, and exerts its function during the late s and g phases of the cell cycle.
