a rad homolog is required for rad independent mitotic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . with the use of an intrachromosomal inverted repeat as a recombination reporter we have previously shown that mitotic recombination is dependent on the rad gene. however, recombination was found to be reduced only fold by mutation of rad, which encodes a homolog of bacterial reca proteins. a rad, which strain containing the recombination reporter was mutagenized to identify components of the rad independent pathway. one mutation identified, rad, reduced recombination fold in the presence of a rad mutation, but only to fold in a wild type background. thus the rad and rad mutations reduce recombination synergistically. the rad mutation reduced both spontaneous and double strand break induced recombination between inverted repeats. however, the rate of interchromosomal recombination was increased in a rad homozygous diploid. these observations suggest that rad functions specifically in intrachromosomal recombination. the rad mutant strain was sensitive to ionizing radiation, and this phenotype was used to clone the rad gene by complementation. the gene encodes a protein of amino acids with significant homology to members of the rad family. overexpression of rad was found to suppress the dna repair and recombination defects conferred by the rad mutation, suggesting that these proteins have overlapping roles or function as a complex.
