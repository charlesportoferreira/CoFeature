evidence for simultaneous protein interactions between human rad paralogs.. . in yeast, the rad related proteins include rad and rad, which form a heterodimer that interacts with rad. five human rad paralogs have been identified (xrcc, xrcc, radb/radl, radc/radl, and radd/radl), and each interacts with one or more of the others. previously we reported that hsrad interacts with xrcc, and radc interacts with xrcc, radb, and hsrad. here we report that in the yeast two hybrid system, radd interacts with xrcc and radc. no other interactions, including self interactions, were found, indicating that the observed interactions are specific. the yeast rad interacts with human rad and xrcc, suggesting rad conservation since the human yeast divergence. data from yeast three hybrid experiments indicate that a number of the pairs of interactions between human rad paralogs can occur simultaneously. for example, radb expression enhances the binding of radc to xrcc and to hsradd, and radc expression allows the indirect interaction of radb with radd. experiments using xhis tagged proteins in the baculovirus system confirm several of our yeast results, including radb interaction with radd only when radc is simultaneously expressed and radc interaction with xrcc only when radd is present. these results suggest that these proteins may participate in one complex or multiple smaller ones.
