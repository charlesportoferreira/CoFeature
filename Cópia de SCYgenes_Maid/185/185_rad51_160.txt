embryonic lethality and radiation hypersensitivity mediated by rad in mice lacking brca.. . inherited mutations in the human brca gene cause about half of the cases of early onset breast cancer. the embryonic expression pattern of the mouse brca gene is now defined and an interaction identified of the brca protein with the dna repair protein rad. developmental arrest in brca deficient embryos, their radiation sensitivity, and the association of brca with rad indicate that brca may be an essential cofactor in the rad dependent dna repair of double strand breaks, thereby explaining the tumour suppressor function of brca.
