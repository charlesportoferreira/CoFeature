efficient production of a ring derivative of chromosome iii by the mating type switching mechanism in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the mating type switches in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae occur by unidirectional transposition of replicas of unexpressed genetic information, residing at hml or hmr, into the mating type locus (mat). the source loci, hml and hmr, remain unchanged. interestingly, when the hm cassettes are expressed, as in marl strains, the hml and hmr cassettes can also efficiently switch, apparently by obtaining genetic information from either of the other two cassettes (klar et al., cell . , ). we have isolated a novel chromosome iii rearrangement in heterothallic (marl ho) strains, which is also produced efficiently in marl ho cells, presumably the consequence of a recombination event between hml and hmr. the fusion results in the loss of sequences which are located distal to hml and to hmr and produces a ring derivative of chromosome iii. cells containing such a ring chromosome are viable as haploids; apparently, no essential loci are located distal to the hm loci. the fusion cassette behaves as a standard hm locus with respect to both regulation by the mar/sir control and its role in switching mat.
