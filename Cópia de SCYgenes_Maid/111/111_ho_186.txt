evidence for a physical interaction between the transposed and the substituted sequences during mating type gene transposition in yeast.. . mating type switches in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae occur by transposition of a replica of the &quot;source&quot; unexpressed loci hml and hmr to the mating type locus (mat). the incoming information replaces previously expressed dna, resulting in an interconversion of mat alleles. a strain of genotype hml alpha/hml alpha mat alpha/mata missense hmr alpha/hmra nonsense ho/ho generates cells with the genotype hml alpha/hml alpha mat alpha/mat a hmr alpha/hmra nonsense ho/ho; that is, wild type mata+ recombinants are produced efficiently by a strain in which the incoming a information and the resident mata allele bear different mutations. production of the wild type mata recombinants requires the homothallism (switching) function, and the incoming a information and the resident mata allele must bear different mutations. this result is consistent with the formation of a heteroduplex between the incoming and the outgoing dna at mat. thus a process of unidirectional gene conversion as a mechanism for mating type gene transposition is favored. a molecular model based on a single strand transfer is proposed. results also favor the idea that the direction of switching is controlled by cell's mating phenotype rather than by the genetic content of mat.
