double strand breaks can initiate meiotic recombination in s. cerevisiae.. . we investigated the effects of double strand breaks on meiotic recombination in yeast. a double strand break was introduced at the mata locus by sporulation of a mat alpha inc/mata diploid under inducing conditions for the ho encoded endonuclease; % of the resulting tetrads had undergone alpha.a conversion. conversion at mat was associated with co conversion of a closely linked marker and an increased recombination frequency for flanking markers. we also studied the sporulation products of a diploid heterozygous at the his locus for an insertion of a bp fragment of mata containing the ho endonuclease cut site. under inducing conditions, a significant number of tetrads were formed that had undergone gene conversions in favor of the his+ allele. although double strand breaks can initiate meiotic recombination in yeast, the data suggest that they do not normally do so.
