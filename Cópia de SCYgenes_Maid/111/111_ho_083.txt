association of yeast sap, a novel member of the 'aaa' atpase family of proteins, with the chromatin protein sin.. . the yeast sin protein is a nuclear protein that together with other proteins behaves as a transcriptional repressor of a family of genes. in addition, sin mutants are defective in proper mitotic chromosome segregation. in an effort to understand the basis for these phenotypes, we employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with sin in vivo. here, we demonstrate that sap, a novel protein belonging to the 'aaa' family of atpases, is able to directly interact with sin. furthermore, we show, using recombinant molecules in vitro, that a short amino acid sequence near the n terminal of sin is sufficient to bind sap. previous experiments defined different domains of sin that interact with other proteins and with dna. the c terminal domain of sin was shown to be responsible for interaction with a protein that binds the regulatory region of ho, a gene whose transcription is repressed by sin. the central 'hmg like region' of sin binds dna, while the n terminal of sin can bind cdc, a protein that regulates chromosome segregation. these data, taken together with the results presented here, suggest that sin is a multifunctional chromatin protein that can interact with a number of different proteins that are involved in several different cellular functions.
