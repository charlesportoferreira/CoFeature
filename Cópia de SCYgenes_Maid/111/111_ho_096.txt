the c terminal domain of sin in yeast interacts with a protein that binds the urs region of the yeast ho gene.. . a protein or protein complex has previously been identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae which both binds a short dna sequence in urs of ho and interacts with sin. sin, which has some sequence similarity to mammalian hmg, is an abundant chromatin protein in yeast and is thought to participate in the transcriptional repression of a specific family of genes. sin binds dna weakly, though it has no dna binding specificity. here we address the nature of the interaction between sin and the specific dna binding protein(s) to ho dna. we show that the isolated c terminal region of sin can interact in vitro with the dna binding protein, causing a supershift in a gel mobility shift assay. interestingly, inclusion of the region in sin which contains two acidic sequences, precludes the binding of recombinant protein to the dna/protein complex.
