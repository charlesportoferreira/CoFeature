switching of a mating type a mutant allele in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . aimed at investigating the recovery of a specific mutant allele of the mating type locus (mat) by switching a defective mat allele, these experiments provide information bearing on several models proposed for mat interconversion in bakers yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae. hybrids between heterothallic (ho) cells carrying a mutant mat a allele, designated mata , and mat alpha ho strains show a high capacity for mating with mata strains. the mat alpha/mata diploids do not sporulate. however, zygotic clones obtained by mating mat alpha homothallic (ho) cells with mata ho cells are unable to mate and can sporulate. tetrad analysis of such clones revealed two diploid (mat alpha/mata).two haploid segregants. therefore, mat switches occur in mat alpha/mata ho/ho cells to produce mat alpha/mata cells capable of sporulation. in heterothallic strains, the mata allele can be switched to a functional mat alpha and subsequently to a functional mata. among mat alpha to mata switches tested, where the mat alpha was previously derived from the mata mutant, only one mata like isolate was observed. however, the recovered allele, unlike the parental allele, complements the matalpha ste mutant, suggesting that these alleles are not identical and that the recovered allele presumably arose as a mutation of the mat alpha locus. no mata was recovered by ho mediated switching of mat alpha (previously obtained from mata by ho) in switches analyzed. we conclude that in homothallic and heterothallic strains, the mata allele can be readily switched to a functional mat alpha and subsequently to a functional mata locus. overall, the results are in accord with the cassette model (hicks, strathern and herskowitz )b) proposed to explain mat interconversions.
