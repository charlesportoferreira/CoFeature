tsf, a global regulatory protein that silences transcription of yeast gal genes, also mediates repression by alpha repressor and is identical to sin.. . tsf encodes one of six (tsf to tsf) recently identified global negative regulators of transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae. mutant tsf strains exhibit defects in transcriptional silencing of the gal promoter, allow expression from upstream activation sequence less promoters, and exhibit pleiotropic defects in cell growth and development. here we show that tsf is involved in transcriptional silencing mediated by the alpha repressor and demonstrate that specific systems of transcriptional silencing may depend on the more global role of tsf. cloning and sequencing of tsf allowed us to predict a amino acid gene product identical to sin, a negative regulator of transcription of the ho (homothallism) mating type switching endonuclease. tsf disruptions are not lethal but result in phenotypes similar to those of the originally isolated alleles. our results, together with those of y. w. jiang and d. j. stillman (mol. cell. biol. . , ), suggest that tsf (sin) affects the function of the basal transcription apparatus, and this effect in turn alters the manner in which the latter responds to upstream regulatory proteins.
