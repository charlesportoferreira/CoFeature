mutations in two ku homologs define a dna end joining repair pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dna double strand break (dsb) repair in mammalian cells is dependent on the ku dna binding protein complex. however, the mechanism of ku mediated repair is not understood. we discovered a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene (ku) that is structurally similar to the kda mammalian ku subunit. kuo associates with the product of the hdf gene, forming the major dna end binding complex of yeast cells. dna end binding was absent in kudelta, hdfdelta, or kudelta hdfdelta strains. antisera specific for epitope tags on ku and hdf were used in supershift and immunodepletion experiments to show that both proteins are directly involved in dna end binding. in vivo, the efficiency of two dna end joining processes were reduced &gt; fold in kuodelta, hdfldelta, or kudelta hdfdelta strains. repair of linear plasmid dna and repair of an ho endonuclease induced chromosomal dsb. these dna joining defects correlated with dna damage sensitivity, because kudelta and hdfdelta strains were also sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate (mms). ku dependent repair is distinct from homologous recombination, because deletion of ku and hdf increased the mms sensitivity of raddelta. interestingly, radodelta, also shown here to be defective in end joining, was epistatic with ku mutations for mms repair and end joining. therefore, ku and rad participate in an end joining pathway that is distinct from homologous recombinational repair. yeast dna end joining is functionally analogous to dsb repair and v(d)j recombination in mammalian cells.
