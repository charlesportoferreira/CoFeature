diversity of y region at hml locus in a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain isolated from a sardinian wine.. . several mutations in genes involved in saccharomyces mating type switching may affect the homothallic behaviour in wine yeasts. in this study the semi homothallic (hq) segregation of a flor wine yeast strain was analysed. we aimed to understand the molecular basis of this behaviour in a flor autochthonous strain, verifying the mat locus status by a pcr based ho gene disruption and sequencing of the y region of the hml, hmr and mat loci, after nested pcr. presence of orfs a and a in the y region of the hml locus was found. at the orf a at hml locus, a mutation in the stop codon was found, so the a orf contains more bases.
