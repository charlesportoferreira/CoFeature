cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the principal acid phosphatase, the phoc+ product, from zymomonas mobilis.. . the zymomonas mobilis gene encoding acid phosphatase, phoc, has been cloned and sequenced. the gene spans base pairs and encodes an mr , polypeptide. this protein was identified as the principal acid phosphatase activity in z. mobilis by using zymograms and was more active with magnesium ions than with zinc ions. its promoter region was similar to the &quot;pho box&quot; region of the escherichia coli pho genes as well as the regulatory sequences for saccharomyces cerevisiae acid phosphatase (pho). a comparison of the gene structure of phoc with that of highly expressed z. mobilis genes revealed that promoters for all genes were similar in degree of conservation of spacing and identity with the proposed z. mobilis consensus sequence in the region. the phoc gene contained a ' transcribed terminus which was at rich, a weak ribosome binding site, and less biased codon usage than the highly expressed z. mobilis genes.
