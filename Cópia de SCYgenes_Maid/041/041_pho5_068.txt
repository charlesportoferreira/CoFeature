phosphorylation of the transcription factor pho by a cyclin cdk complex, pho pho.. . induction of the yeast gene pho is mediated by the transcription factors pho and pho. pho transcription is not detectable in high phosphate; it is thought that the negative regulators pho and pho inactivate pho and pho. here it is reported that pho has homology to yeast cyclins and interacts with pho, a pcdc/cdc related protein kinase. the pho pho complex phosphorylates pho; this phosphorylation is correlated with negative regulation of pho. these results demonstrate the existence of a cyclin cdk complex that is used for a regulatory process other than cell cycle control and identify a physiologically relevant substrate for this complex.
