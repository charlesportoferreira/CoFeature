high yield synthesis of the bovine leukemia virus (blv) p major internal protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . bovine leukemia virus (blv) p gene was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the pho (encoding repressible acid phosphatase, rapase) promoter. yeast cells were transformed by a yeast e. coli shuttle vector carrying the pho promoter, the p gene and the cyc transcription terminator. after low inorganic phosphate (pi) induction of the pho promoter, p accumulated in the producing cells up to a concentration representing % of total soluble proteins. the expression level of p gene was not increased by insertion of the positive regulatory gene pho on the p expression vector. the p produced in this system and incubated in crude yeast extract showed a remarkably high resistance to proteolytic degradation, a feature that presumably correlates with the compact globular conformation of the protein combined to the stabilizing effect of the n terminal residue.
