use of beta lactamase as a secreted reporter of promoter function in yeast.. . k preprotoxin is the residue precursor of the k killer toxin secreted by the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sp beta la reporter consists of the mature, secreted form of beta lactamase (beta la) fused to s and p, two fragments of preprotoxin. s is the n terminal residues, including the secretion signal. p, a residue 'processing' segment with three sites for n glycosylation, terminates in a lys arg site for cleavage by the kex protease. expression of sp beta a in yeast results in efficient secretion, processing by signal peptidase and glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum, producing pro beta la. kex cleavage of pro beta la in the lumen of a late golgi compartment releases beta la, which accumulates stably in culture media buffered at ph . . the half life of secretion is min at degrees c; % of the total activity in exponential phase cells is intracellular, mostly in the form of pro beta la, indicating that transit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi is rate limiting. we have used sp beta la expression in single and multi copy vectors to compare the pgk, gal, gal, pho and cup promoters under varying nutritional conditions. in exponential phase cells, secretion of beta la over a fold range and up to several micrograms/ml was proportional to transcript level, demonstrating that sp beta la can be employed as a convenient secreted reporter of promoter function in yeast.
