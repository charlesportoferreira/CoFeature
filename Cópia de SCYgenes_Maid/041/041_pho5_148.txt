molecular analysis of the dna sequences involved in the transcriptional regulation of the phosphate repressible acid phosphatase gene (pho) of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the expression of the pho gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae is transcriptionally regulated in response to the level of inorganic phosphate present in the growth medium. we have identified, by dna deletion analysis, the sequences (upstream activator sequences) that mediate this response. the sequence ' ctgcacaaatg ' is present in two copies located within a base pair region. the presence of a single copy of the sequence is sufficient for the phosphate mediated transcriptional response. in addition, a dna fragment that contains two copies of this sequence will act to repress transcription of a cyc lacz fusion when placed either upstream or downstream of the cyc activator sequence.
