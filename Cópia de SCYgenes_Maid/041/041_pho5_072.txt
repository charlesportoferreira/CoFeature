the transactivation domain of pho is required for nucleosome disruption at the pho promoter.. . the chromatin structure of the pho promoter is disrupted when the promoter is derepressed by phosphate starvation. the transactivator, pho, is primarily responsible for this change. we have used deletion mutations of pho in order to determine which protein domains are involved in nucleosome dissolution. our results show that the dna binding domain by itself is not sufficient to trigger chromatin disruption, even when overexpressed. in vivo footprinting reveals that pho derivatives lacking the n terminal activation domain can bind to uasp, which resides in a constitutively nucleosome free region, but not to uasp, which lies within a nucleosome in the repressed pho promoter. the acidic activation domain of pho appears to be involved in nucleosome disruption. substitution of the native transactivation domain of pho with that from vp results in substantial chromatin disruption. in every case, the ability of the pho mutants to activate transcription correlates with their ability to disrupt nucleosome structure in the pho promoter. therefore, we conclude that the pho activation domain has at least two roles. (i) to trigger disruption of nucleosome structure over the promoter, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors, and (ii) to interact with the transcriptional apparatus at the proximal promoter.
