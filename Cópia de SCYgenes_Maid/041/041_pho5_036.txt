a cysteine residue in helixii of the bhlh domain is essential for homodimerization of the yeast transcription factor phop.. . the yeast transcription factor phop is required for expression of the phosphate repressible acid phosphatase encoded by the pho gene. functional studies have shown that the molecule is composed of an n terminal acidic activation domain, a central region which is necessary for interaction with a negative regulatory factor (the cyclin pho) and a c terminal basic helix loop helix domain, which mediates dna binding and homodimerization. in this study the homodimerization domain maps specifically to helixii of this region and a cysteine residue within this region is essential for this function. experiments support the role of an intermolecular disulfide bond in stabilization of homodimerization, which is critical for dna binding.
