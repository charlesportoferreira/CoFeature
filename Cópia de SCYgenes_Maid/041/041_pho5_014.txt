structure and function of cyclin dependent pho kinase of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has five cyclin dependent protein kinases (cdks), cdc, srb, kin, ctk, and pho. any of these cdks requires a cyclin partner for its kinase activity and a cdk/cyclin complex, thus produced, phosphorylates a set of specific substrate proteins to exert its function. the cyclin partners of srb, kin, and ctk are srb, ccl, and ctk, respectively. in contrast to the fact that each of srb, kin, and ctk has a single cyclin partner, cdc and pho are polygamous; cdc has cyclins and pho has cyclins. among these cdks, kin and cdc are essential cdks and it is well known that cdc kinase plays a major role in regulating cell cycle progression. pho is a non essential cdk but its absence causes a broad spectrum of phenotypes such as constitutive expression of pho, inability to utilize non fermentable carbon sources, defects in cell cycle progression, and so on. pho homologues are expanding to higher eukaryotes. pho is most closely related with cdk in terms of the amino acid sequence. the functional analysis of the domains of pho also supports the close relationship between pho and cdk, in which it was shown that the method of regulation of these two kinases is similar. furthermore, forced expression of the mammalian cdk gene in a phodelta strain canceled a part of the pho defects. in this review, we summarize the functions of both pho/cyclin kinase and emphasize yeast pho as valuable model systems to elucidate the functions of their homologues in other organisms.
