[cloning, structure and features of a saccharomyces cerevisiae dna fragment causing the expression of reporter genes]. . a dna fragment &quot;px&quot; of b.p. was isolated at random from the genomic sequences of s. cerevisiae by using a plasmid that contained a promoterless reporter gene lacz of e. coli. &quot;px&quot; was capable of activating synthesis of three reporter genes (pho from yeast and bacterial lacz and neo) in yeast cells bidirectionally. results of southern blot hybridization with yeast genomic dna suggest that the cloned sequence is represented in at least ten copies per cell. nucleotide sequence of &quot;px&quot; shows that dna contains putative tata elements and four tandems of inverted repeats.
