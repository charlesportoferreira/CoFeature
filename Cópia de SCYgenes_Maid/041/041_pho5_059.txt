the homeodomain protein pho and the basic helix loop helix protein pho bind dna cooperatively at the yeast pho promoter.. . two transcription factors, the bhlh protein pho and the homeodomain protein pho, are required for transcriptional activation of the pho promoter in saccharomyces cerevisiae. there are two essential pho binding sites, corresponding to the regulatory elements uasp and uasp at the pho promoter, but only a single, dispensable pho binding site had previously been identified. we have reinvestigated binding of pho to the pho promoter using purified recombinant protein and have found multiple pho binding sites of different affinities along the promoter. one of the high affinity pho sites largely overlaps the pho binding site at uasp. cooperative dna binding of the two proteins to their overlapping sites, resulting in a high affinity ternary complex, was demonstrated. pho and pho also bind dna cooperatively at uasp where two pho sites flank the pho site. finally, pho facilitates binding of pho to a third, cryptic pho binding site which binds pho with lower affinity than uasp or uasp. these results suggest that cooperative dna binding with pho is integral to the mechanism by which pho regulates transcription of the pho gene.
