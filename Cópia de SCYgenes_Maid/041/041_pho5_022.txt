redox regulation of amp synthesis in yeast. a role of the basp and basp transcription factors.. . expression of yeast amp synthesis genes (ade genes) was severely affected when cells were grown under oxidative stress conditions. to get an insight into the molecular mechanisms of this new transcriptional regulation, the role of the basp and basp transcription factors, known to activate expression of the ade genes, was investigated. in vitro, dna binding of basp was sensitive to oxidation. however, this sensitivity could not account for the regulation of the ade genes because we showed, using a bas vp chimera, that basp dna binding activity was not sensitive to oxidation in vivo. consistently, a triple cysteine mutant of basp (fully resistant to oxidation in vitro) was unable to restore transcription of the ade genes under oxidative conditions. we then investigated the possibility that basp could be the oxidative stress responsive factor. interestingly, transcription of the pho gene, which is dependent on basp but not on basp, was found to be severely impaired by oxidative stress. nevertheless, a basp cysteine free mutant was not sufficient to confer resistance to oxidative stress. finally, we found that a basp basp fusion protein restored ade gene expression under oxidative conditions, thus suggesting that redox sensitivity of ade gene expression could be due to an impairment of basp/basp interaction. this hypothesis was further substantiated in a two hybrid experiment showing that basp/basp interaction is affected by oxidative stress.
