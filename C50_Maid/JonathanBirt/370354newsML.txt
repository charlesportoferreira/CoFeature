unilever plc stirred up the world chemicals industry tuesday with surprise news that it plans to sell most of its speciality chemicals businesses.. the announcement of the massive disposal programme, which analysts said could net up to five billion pounds ($. billion) for the anglo dutch group, sparked a rash of speculation about potential buyers.. the four businesses, national starch &amp; chemical co., quest international, unichema international and crosfield, had total sales of around three billion pounds ($. billion) last year and employ nearly , people in countries.. analysts said the move, which could free unilever up for a major acquisition in its core food, detergents and personal product businesses, was well timed.. the company is taking advantage of a shake up in chemicals as europe comes to grips with overcapacity and increasing competition from the united states and asia by swapping assets and disposing of non core operations.. businesses like unilever's are particularly attractive, offering higher margins and less volatile performance than industrial chemicals. with profit margins of more than percent, unilever's businesses "are at the good end of the range," said williams de broe analyst peter cartwright..
