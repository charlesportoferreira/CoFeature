telecommunications firm mitel corp sees growth in the computer telephony integration business lagging expectations, chief executive john millard told reuters on friday.. "it's certainly come more slowly than we anticipated and we see projections of the volume of business in this area being pushed back, but i can tell you that there's tremendous interest in the networks," millard said in a phone interview.. ottawa based mitel has stumbled in recent months because its computer telephony integration (cti) unit, which makes lines and equipment to combine telephone and data into one network, did not achieve forecast results.. mitel warned investors in late february that it expected fourth quarter earnings to fall to c$. a share in the period ending march from year earlier c$. a share.. it also took a c$ million restructuring charge due to increased operating costs and additional price cuts by rivals.. "before we see what you might call explosive growth in this area, it might be another year," millard said of cti.. he said mitel planned to release a slew of cti and pbx products later this year, which would boost fiscal earnings per share from the estimated c$. in fiscal .. mitel also makes public branch exchange (pbx) telephone switches and semiconductors.. shares in mitel closed up . to . in toronto on friday and were unchanged at / in new york..
