"the test they have going with the biggest potential to really kind of blow the doors off the numbers is with subway," caicco said.. the privately held submarine sandwich chain is the world's second largest restaurant franchisor after mcdonald's corp.. the company began testing with subway in u.s. locations a few weeks ago, caicco said.. yogen fruz president michael serruya cautioned.

"they're actively, right now, looking at five or six deals in the u.s.," caicco said. the other analyst said the prime target was in the north eastern united states.. caicco added. "they may also, in fact, purchase or acquire a franchise that is not specifically complementary to what they do, but might be something that they could move out into their very strong sort of international franchise network.. yogen fruz, which is running out of manufacturing capacity, is considering buying a pennsylvania plant in the next one or two months, caicco added.. serruya would only say that it would be on the u.s. east coast..
