"the weather has been very dry, despite reports that it has been raining recently...we do not call this rain," he said.. little or no rain fell in most areas during the first days of february leading to concern that possible damage to trees would reduce mid crop (april sept) potential and reduce bean sizes in developing pods.. but official data for the last eight days of the month show average rainfall at weather stations of . mm, against . mm in the previous days and .mm for the last eight days of february last year.. ivory coast produced a record . million tonnes / crop after a bumper , tonnes mid crop.. some industry forecasters raised / crop estimates after strong main crop arrivals. mid crop prospects are expected to be clearer by mid march as pod counters complete tallies.. late mid crop volumes depend partly on rains up to april..
