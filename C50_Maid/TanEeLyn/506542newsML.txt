hong kong's colonial government cautioned beijing on monday not to cause constitutional problems by enacting laws for the territory before britain hands it back to china at midnight on june .. security secretary peter lai said beijing might spark a flurry of lawsuits that would work against its declared aim of a smooth transition for hong kong.. lai's warning came after hong kong's future lawmakers from a china appointed provisional legislature said they would develop laws for the territory before july , which marks the end of more than years of british colonial rule.. residency rights, or the so called "right of abode", in hong kong after the handover are among the issues china wants the body to decide before the handover, but the hong kong government is opposed, lai said.. "we clearly cannot accept this because there can only be one legislature for hong kong before july , and that is the legally constituted legislative council of hong kong which exists today," lai told reporters.. but the hong kong government warning appeared unlikely to worry china. lu ping, beijing's top official on hong kong matters, said the right of abode issue was an internal affair because it concerned china's nationality laws.. "the provisional legislature does not need the approval of the british government," lu told reporters.. the member provisional legislature that beijing intends to install in place of the elected council faces fierce opposition from the pro democracy camp. democrats have vowed to sue the body if it tries to make laws before july .. while britain and china have agreed on major provisions on the right of abode, they are deadlocked on actual legislation.. "immigration/nationality matters are a notoriously litigious area...if decisions have to be taken on the basis of legislation processed by the provisional legislature before july , they would attract a huge amount of litigation which could paralyse the immigration system in hong kong after june ," lai said.. "that would be highly unconducive to a smooth transition.". the issue on right of abode in hong kong after july is close to the hearts of , hong kong people who have obtained foreign citizenship in recent years but who also value their permanent residency rights in hong kong.. uncertainty has prompted a scramble for air tickets among migrants anxious to land in hong kong before midnight june .. emigrants can establish permanent right of abode in hong kong if they return within months of the handover, the hong kong and macau affairs office in beijing said.. hong kong chinese will retain hong kong permanent residency status unless they stay away for more than months before resettling in the territory, a spokesman for the office said.. rita fan, president of the interim legislature, vowed to press on and make the draft right of abode bill into law..
