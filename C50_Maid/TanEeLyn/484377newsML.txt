"the last statement from china was that as long as we remain helpful to hong kong, the status quo will remain. but it's quite vague and nothing is written about it," she said.. "they feel concerned whether their positions would be taken by mainland women," she said, voicing fears that hong kong employers and future authorities, might prefer to allow more mainland chinese women to work as maids.. tellez also stressed that the philippine government needed to address the wider concern of filipinos working overseas.. "what is there when we go back home, will i have something to look forward to?" she said.. the hong kong filipino community are part of a diaspora of four million filipinos, according to official data, working abroad to support families in their relatively poor country.. tellez said the number of filipinos working overseas was probably as high as seven million, when taking into account illegal workers.. spread over countries the world over, the guest workers remit us$ billion each year back to the philippines..
