a south korean official on tuesday said progress had been made in talks with china over the fate of the most senior leader to flee pyongyang but terms of his departure from beijing were still undecided.. hwang jang yop, a senior north korean ideologue and top aide to supreme leader kim jong il, has been stranded in seoul's mission in beijing since february while the three nations negotiate his fate..
