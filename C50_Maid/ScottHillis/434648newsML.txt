talks in beijing on the fate of a senior pyongyang defector have made progress but have not clinched a deal despite a personal bid by north korea's foreign minister to break the deadlock.. "there has been some headway. negotiations are still going on," chang moon ik, spokesman for the south korean embassy in beijing, said on tuesday about talks on hwang jang yop, who sought refuge in seoul's beijing consulate four weeks ago.. hwang, a senior north korean ideological theoritician and top aide to supreme leader kim jong il, has been stranded in the consular compound since february while the three nations negotiate his fate.. officials in south korea said on monday they expected a breakthrough this week in talks with china aimed at securing hwang's passage out of beijing, but chang said it was unlikely he would be moved in the next few days..

"we want to bring mr hwang to seoul directly but if that is not possible we can make other arrangements," embassy spokesman chang said. korean sources have said hwang may be whisked away to another country, possibly in southeast asia.. armed chinese police backed by armoured personnel carriers and a crowd control truck maintained a tight security cordon around seoul's consular compound, in beijing's normally sedate diplomatic quarter, where hwang is holed up.. beijing has appealed to north and south korea to stay calm during attempts to end the diplomatic standoff sparked by hwang's defection.. chinese foreign minister qian qichen said last week beijing was still investigating hwang's case and hoped for a solution as soon as possible.. north korea initially accused the south of kidnapping hwang, then changed its hardline stance by saying that if he really had defected he was a traitor and would be dismissed.. beijing, which sent its armies to fight on pyongyang's side during the korean war, established diplomatic links with seoul only in ..
