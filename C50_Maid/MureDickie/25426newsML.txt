"minerals resources are very rich here," zou said in an interview. "this is the 'kingdom of non ferrous metals'.". output of electrolytic copper would be raised to , tonnes a year by , increasing from , tonnes last year, said zhou, the general manager.. the group's mines would wrest about , tonnes of copper ore a year from yunnan's mountains, up from , tonnes, he said..
