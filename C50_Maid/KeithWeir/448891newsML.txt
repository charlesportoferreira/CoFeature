"we are comfortable with that provision," makinson told reuters in a telephone interview. "the million pounds is to cover all known and foreseen eventualities," he added.. makinson dismissed a report in the sunday times newspaper that the charge could double as a result of legal action by book retailers in the united states.. pearson increased its full year dividend to p from .p. the company's shares slipped p to p in early trading although the figures were broadly in line with market forecasts.. a great deal of market attention focused on the plans of texan scardino, who took the reins at pearson in january.. she acknowledged that the company's profit performance must improve but gave few clues as to which parts of the business could be sacrificied in her drive for focus.. among pearson's assets are the financial times newspaper, a number of television production companies and a leisure arm which includes london's madame tussaud's waxworks museum.. "the major immediate changes under new management at pearson will be the ones of style and focus on performance. as time goes on, we may change the business we're in too, as we work toward being first in a few important markets," scardino said..
