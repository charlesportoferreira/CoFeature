"bskyb is positioning itself to become a key player in digital," chief executive sam chisholm told a news conference.. "digital satellite is going to be the primary driver (of the new technology) as it offers such a wide range of services," chisholm added.. bskyb, in which rupert murdoch's news corp is the leading shareholder, earlier said pre tax profit rose percent to . million pounds ($. million) in the six months to end december, up from . million a year ago.. it reported record subscriber growth of , in the last three months of last year and now has over six million customers in britain and ireland.. bskyb shares continued their surge of recent days as markets welcomed the digital developments. bskyb closed .p higher at .p, its best level for over three months.. bskyb said it expected shortly to confirm an order for up to one million digital satellite decoders from four manufacturers as it gears up for an autumn launch.. it plans to work with partners to offer interactive services such as home shopping and home banking as part of the digital satellite package.. chisholm said a new company would be formed to subsidise the digital satellite decoder so that it could retail for around pounds. a decoder is needed to view any digital service.. he did not name the members of the company, but bskyb is reported to have had talks with british telecommunications, japanese electronics company matsushita and bankers hsbc.. bskyb remained optimistic about the prospects for digital television in germany, playing down the initial slow take up recorded by kirch gruppe's df..
