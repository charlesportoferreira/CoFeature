"our commitment to the growth of our businesses in asia/pacific is as strong as ever, but we have decided that this investment is no longer effective in developing either our television business or our other interests in the region," scardino said.. pearson acquired the stake in tvb two years ago for . million pounds and has received dividends of . million pounds on it.. share analysts were pleased that scardino had made an early move in her attempts to improve the focus of the business and said that pearson had done well to recover its investment.. "it's obviously a blow to greg dyke," said one, referring to the head of pearson's television arm, adding that scardino appeared to have reversed part of his strategy.. there has been speculation that dyke, a well known figure in the british media world, may shortly part company with pearson.. dyke said that the investment had given pearson great insight into the television business in asia.. "however since we made the minority investment pearson television's strategy has evolved to concentrate on programme making and larger broadcast roles," he added.. pearson shares stood unchanged at .p after the announcement.. debt rating agency moody's said on friday it was downgrading pearson. moody's said that this reflected its view that pearson's debt protection measurements weakened by recent acquisitions would not recover to previous levels near term.. scardino, the first woman to head a leading british company, has promised to improve pearson's profit performance.. the company has a clutch of big name assets such as the financial times newspaper and penguin books but has failed to secure an adequate return on these.. analysts say that the company lacks focus and have predicted that pearson may sell its tussauds leisure unit and its stake in merchant bank lazards.. the scardino era got off to a bad start when the company announced last week that improper accounting at penguin usa would force it to make a charge of up to million pounds against profits.. pearson said the problems dated back five years but had come to light only very recently.
