"i think they are credible forecasts, but not very encouraging," david lubin, an economist at hsbc midland told reuters.. "it's okay for a country to run a current account deficit of nine percent of gdp but only if you believe in the future the economy will generate trade surpluses big enough to repay the debt that's being accumulated to finance the deficits.". according to the csu estimates, the current account shortfall should be between . . percent of gdp in . it forecast the trade deficit to widen to billion crowns from a deficit of . billion crowns last year.. at the heart of the trade gap was a . percent rise in imports in , due in large part to firms investing in new machinery and materials, badly needed as part of the country's economic restructuring.. meanwhile exports stagnated, rising only . percent for the year. but the csu said it expects exports to grow . . percent in , while import growth should ease slightly to percent..
