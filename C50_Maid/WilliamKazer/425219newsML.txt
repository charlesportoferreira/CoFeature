china's economic tsar has called for tougher controls on financial risk to protect the nation's banking system and set strict guidelines for trimming its huge pile of bad debt.. vice premier zhu rongji said state banks, struggling with loans they may never recover, needed to cut bad debt by two percent a year or their top managers could be sacked, the official people's daily said on thursday.. "the financial system must make a major push in to restore financial order and reduce risk," zhu told delegates to the nation's parliament.. "we must seek to reduce the rate of bad loans by two percent annually over the next few years," he said. "we will hold accountable the leaders of those banks that cannot meet the standards.". zhu, former head of the central bank, has been pushing to insulate banks from speculative investments in real estate as well as the nation's volatile stock and futures markets.. he has ordered banks to divorce themselves from trust company subsidiaries that can invest in more speculative markets.. he has also pushed hard for banks to extend loans based on the creditworthiness of their customers.. many local governments pressure state banks to lend money to key enterprises that are major employers even when they are unlikely to repay.. zhu reminded government officials that the commercial bank law bars local governments from interfering in bank operations.. central bank officials have said as much as percent of all loans extended by state run banks were non performing.. some big banks might be insolvent if their bad loans were written off, financial analysts say.. in january, china announced it had shut the china agribusiness development trust and investment corp (cadtic), major trust firm, for unspecified irregularities.. on thursday, official newspapers reported that the state would stand behind the debts of cadtic, repaying principal though it would not pay interest..
