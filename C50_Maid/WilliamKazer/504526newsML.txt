china has scored new successes in its fight against inflation and economists said on friday that price rises this year could be well below target.. some economists say inflation has been squeezed out of the economy with only a modest impact on growth as economic expansion continued at a fairly rapid pace.. "this is better than expected," said chen dezun, head of the price research institute of the state planning commission..
