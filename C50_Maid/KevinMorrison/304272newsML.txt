the surprise purchase by australia's biggest gambler, kerry packer, of control at the sydney casino was welcomed by investors and analysts on monday.. shares in sydney harbour casino holdings ltd (shc), which owns the sydney casino and packer's publishing and broadcasting ltd (pbl), were both up after the deal.. analysts said the deal was good for both companies as packer's influence was likely to yield a tax concession for the casino on the high roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and pbl's coffers. . under the deal, pbl will buy percent of shc for a$. per share from showboat inc and pay the u.s. casino operator a$ million for management control of the casino.. the casino deal is likely to put any plans packer has of controlling newspaper publisher john fairfax holdings ltd on the back burner, analysts said.. pbl has a percent stake in fairfax and packer has said he would like to control fairfax. . shc, which holds a year monopoly to operate the only legal casino in australia's largest city, has battled with the new south wales (nsw) state government for the past months to get a similar tax rate to other australian casinos.. "i think packer will probably get the tax break from the government," one sydney based casino analyst said. "i expect there will be some tax break announcement this month," he said.. the sydney casino is seeking a percent tax concession from the nsw government on big spending gamblers, mainly from asia, compared with the present tax rate of percent. . shc chief executive neil gamble told reuters last month the tax break could equate up to a$ million in new revenue and about a$ million to the casino's bottom line profit.. analysts said pbl would improve the running of the casino, which has consistently failed to meet its profit forecasts..
