"this quarter took the wind out of their sails," said daniel ries, a nomura research analyst.. "rather than easily achieve (wall) street estimates, ibm appeared to be huffing and puffing," morgan stanley analyst steve milunovich said in a note to clients.. ibm stock more than doubled in the last year, aided late in the year by merrill lynch analyst daniel mandresh, who in november raised his price target for ibm stock to $.. on wednesday mandresh cut his earnings estimate for ibm to $ a share from $., traders said. mandresh did not return calls seeking comment. but traders said he reiterated his buy rating on the stock and the $ price target.. for all of , ibm earned $. billion, or $. a share.. while ibm's service business continued to perform well in the fourth quarter revenues there grew percent mainframe sales were disappointing and its microelectronics unit was hurt by a drop in computer memory chip prices.. in addition, sales of rs/ workstations were flat..
