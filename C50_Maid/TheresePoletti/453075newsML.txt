"i'd like to add here that i am very happy and proud that our transformation has created job growth," gerstner said in his letter to shareholders, in which he described overall as "a solid year.". when gerstner first took over the then struggling computer giant in april , one of his first actions was to take a whopping restructuring charge and cut , jobs from ibm.. the global services unit which designs, installs and services computers, including running entire corporate computer systems was formerly part of ibm's sales and services group.. sales and services will be renamed the sales and distribution group, still headed by ibm senior vice president ned lautenbach.. ibm also said dennie welsh, who was general manager of global services, will be promoted to a senior vice president and report directly to gerstner.. welsh was also named an ibm group executive and will join ibm's executive committee, which makes strategic decisions.. "the time is right for this change," gerstner said in an ibm memo announcing the reorganization. "he (welsh) and his colleagues on the services team have done an outstanding job building a great new business for ibm. this change not only reflects a logical adjustment in our organisational structure, but also a recognition of their success.". ibm's services business has been its fastest growing in recent quarters. in the fourth quarter, ibm said services revenues jumped percent to $ billion. in comparison, ibm's total revenues grew percent in the fourth quarter..

"anything this important demands direct oversight by gerstner.". wednesday's move follows changes in december when ibm consolidated computer services under the ibm global services brand. ibm's services organisation had been operating in some countries outside the united states under different names.. the addition of global services now gives ibm five major corporate divisions. the others are the software group, the server group, which makes the computers that run networks; the personal systems group; and sales and distribution.. with welsh's promotion to ibm senior vice president, the company now has a total of senior vice presidents.. ibm stock fell $. to $. on the new york stock exchange..
