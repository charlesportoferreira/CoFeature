gte corp, the one big local telephone company already able to offer long distance across much of the united states is being courted for alliances and mergers, but seems relatively self sufficient.. analysts who attended a meeting with the company on friday came away impressed by the list of suitors.. "they said they have been in merger and alliance talks with everyone from at&amp;t (corp) to worldcom (inc), but they didn't give the impression that talks had gone very far," said barry sine of brokers sbc warburg. . analysts were even more impressed by how well gte expects it can do on its own and by the freedom from management distractions that such self sufficiency offers.. gte forecast that earnings per share in and beyond would rise percent a year or more, including a infusion of a third to half a billion dollars of long distance revenues. telephone revenues in the u.s., where growth in customer lines has often been the best in the industry, were expected to grow percent in .. gte shares took a cue from the presentation, rising $. on friday and a further $/ to $ / by midday on monday. .
