"as wireless customers realise its not that much more expensive to use a cellular phone to make a long distance call we could get a real windfall...," kiernan said.. on top of this services such as caller id are a big boost to revenues and profits, first because they cost almost nothing to provide to each marginal user and because they help retain customers who might switch between providers.. "revenue per customer in wireless is down only . percent from the prior year," kiernan said. wireless companies have come to expect bigger falls in average revenue per user as falling prices enable casual users to take a mobile phone.. traditionally, wireless providers cope by switching to cheaper methods of acquiring new customers through retailers or resellers to offset marginal revenue declines.. but kiernan said value added services help support the wireless revenue curve, even as costs decline.. already sbc reaped over $ billion in revenues in from value added services, mostly on the wired network.. in wired networks a new generation of software based features would be available in mid using advanced intelligent networks (ain), kiernan said.. ain means a phone or data network carries plenty of its own computing power and more information about a call than existing networks.. desktop video conferencing is available already, but others will include call management based on information extracted from caller id records. eventually many of the new features will migrate to the wireless network too.. kiernan said that sbc had just last week started selling a package of local and long distance calling, plus local and long distance wireless under the cellular one brand in new york state.. "we will be rolling that out in our other out of region markets in chicago, washington/baltimore, boston during , so that will further buoy up average revenue per customer," he said.
