sears, roebuck &amp; co. will spend more than $ million to revamp and expand its stand alone tire and battery stores under the new national tire and battery name, the retailer said wednesday.. the change is part of a plan under which sears will spend more than $ billion through the year on its entire auto group, adding stores and converting some existing stores.. hoffman estates, ill. based sears, which sold million tires and . million batteries through its sears tire group in , will combine most of its tire america and national tire warehouse stores under the national tire and battery name, sears said.. the company also plans to add about national tire stores a year over the next five years, and hopes to add about $ million in annual tire group revenue when the expansion is completed. sears tire group had $. billion in revenues in .. the stores, unveiled wednesday in chicago, will have a high tech, open feel, with customers able to watch the work being done on their cars. pricing will be competitive in individual markets, sears said.. "we will be at market pricing in every market we're in," paul baffico, president of sears automotive group, said in an interview. "we do not necessarily want to be the market price leader, but we will be competitive with anybody who is in the market.". the stores, which will be located away from shopping malls, are geared toward a younger, higher income customer with higher performance car needs than the mall based sears auto centres, baffico said. because of the existence of the mall stores, the retailer chose not to include the sears name in national tire and battery.. "from a location strategy standpoint, a different name allows us to be closer to a sears store without cannabilizing the market," baffico said.. areas targeted for new tire stores this year are detroit, minneapolis/st. paul, rochester, n.y. and buffalo, n.y.. sears will also add a small number of sears auto centre stores in malls, baffico said.. separately, sears plans to spend more than $ million to add parts america auto parts stores by the year and to transform western auto stores to parts america, he said.. "we should be by the clear no. in parts," baffico said. that category is currently led by memphis, tenn. based autozone inc., followed by pep boys manny, moe &amp; jack of philadelphia, based on revenues. sears' parts group had $. billion in revenue in .. since the parts stores do not compete with sears' mall stores, the company will decide by the end of the summer whether to include the sears name in the name of the stores, baffico said.. one analyst said that sears' expansion plans for the automotive group were aggressive, but noted that the company was being even more aggressive in other formats.. "those are relatively aggressive, but remember they're coming from a place where they've been a little stagnant for a while," stephen latz, of a.g. edwards, said of the auto group expansion plans..
