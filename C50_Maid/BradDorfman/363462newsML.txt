reliance acceptance corp said friday it borrowed from its bank credit lines because the less expensive short term commercial debt market has been essentially closed to sub prime lenders most of this week.. "this week, with what's hit with the other companies, nobody's buying commercial paper," said howard silverman, chairman of reliance, the auto lending unit of wheeling, ill. based cole taylor financial group inc. . sub prime lenders, who loan money to consumers with riskier credit, had trouble securing commercial debt due to problems with mercury finance co and another firm.. last week, mercury said it overstated its earnings by about $ million over the last four years, due to accounting discrepancies. the company is currently in default and negotiating with its lenders to try to obtain short term financing to stabilize the company.. on thursday, dallas based jayhawk acceptance corp, another sub prime lender, said it might have to file for reorganization under protection of the u.s. bankruptcy code. . sub prime lenders use commercial debt, with maturities of days or less, to fund purchases of loans from auto dealers. they make money on the spread, or difference, between what they pay for funds and the higher rates of the loans.. reliance's bank debt can cost about basis points more than commercial debt, lowering the amount they make on the spread, the company said. but reliance also stressed that its bank credit exceeds its commercial debt lines, and that the company has full access to its bank financing.. "our bank group is terrific," said jim kaplan, general counsel for reliance. "they have called us and told us they are strongly behind us.". analysts said they had also heard that the commercial debt market has been closed to sub prime lenders this week.. "mercury has been making a lot of people gun shy," said thomas kmiotek, analyst at duff &amp; phelps credit rating co.. ((chicago newsdesk )).
