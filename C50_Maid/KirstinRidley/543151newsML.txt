"the timing required to accomplish the technical integration of the various parts as well as the investments necessary to establish the new brand on a nation wide basis suggest that at . billion stg, cwc assets are fairly valued.". with . billion pounds of capital expenditure, cwc plans to complete its sophisticated broadband cable and local telephone networks and offer its services to six million customers by .. however, other analysts, such as richard jones at brokers yamaichi and andrew harrington at salomon brothers, were more bullish.. jones is recommending buying the stock up to pence per share. harrington values the shares at p and the company at . billion pounds.. harrington argues that cwc's network cost structure has a competitive advantage against its main telephony and multi channel television provider british telecommunications plc and satellite broadcaster british sky broadcasting group plc.. "it's got percent fewer employees per line than bt," he said. "we think cwc has a unique competitive advantage in the provision of multi channel tv and telephony. i think it's going to exceed expectations in the next year.". cwc's core business will be the telephony provided by mercury. initially, percent of revenues will come from telephony and only nine percent from entertainment, but it will be the first company to be able to bundle multi channel television and telephony.. nevertheless, some analysts are cautious about the new company's prospects. cable television companies have yet to make a profit in britain's stagnant market..

"put that alongside the impact of bt's on going marketing muscle in basic telephony, combined with the impact of digital terrestrial tv and digital satellite tv, and i think that will all serve to put a brake on our expectations of long term cable tv penetration," he said.. oliver ehrenberg, telecoms analyst at robert fleming, says cwc is not worth more than . billion pounds and says his valuation is already stretched.. but harrington brushed aside these concerns, noting that bt's network will need a lot of investment to upgrade its telephone lines so they can support multi channel tv and interactive services..
