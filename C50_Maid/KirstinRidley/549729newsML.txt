music companies are waiting for the world to rock to a new sound that will entice consumers back into record stores and drive up sluggish global sales.. without new global best sellers and an economic upturn, few analysts expect the global market to bask in the double digit growth seen from to when people lined about around the block to get the latest records such as pop group r.e.m.'s "monster.". discounting among retailers, international piracy of cassettes and compact discs and an ageing population, whose first stop at the mall might be a book store rather than a record store, have all hit the more mature markets.. global sales of pre recorded music reached $. billion in , a . percent growth in retail value over . four billion compact discs, cassettes and records percent more than in were sold.. but the rate of growth is slowing. in retail value, global growth was percent in and a hefty percent in .. the figures, compiled by the international federation of the phonographic industry (ifpi), which represents the world's record firms, confirm that growth in developing markets is surging. but more mature markets such as north america have been hit by static sales and falling prices.. david chermont, media analyst at merrill lynch, said that investors had become used to the lack of "mind blowing" growth, however, in an industry which is made up of a mix of growth and cyclical markets that wax and wane with economic confidence..
