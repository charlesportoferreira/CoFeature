"there has quite clearly been a re rating in the last week and i think it's going to continue," said jason crisp, media analyst at brokers socgen.. another broker said only in "wildly optimistic" cases could the shares be valued even at p.. negative weekend newspaper reports helped compound last week's share falls sparked by a report in the financial times that bskyb could be shut out of the bidding for new digital tv licences, experts said.. the financial times reported last week the television watchdog, the independent television commission, had told bskyb it should drop its one third stake in a consortium with commercial tv groups carlton communications and granada group.. bskyb was enjoying an effective monopoly on pay television and the watchdog was concerned about market domination, the ft said.. the report, which remains unconfirmed, followed last week's announcement that bskyb's respected chief executive sam chisolm was stepping down and deputy managing director david chance was becoming a consultant.. socgen's crisp said the stock, which had hit an intraday high of p on february , had been vastly over rated and should be trading nearer p.. he noted apart from the possible loss of its equity stake in its digital terrestrial tv consortium, called british digital broadcasting, and the loss of two very talented and experienced staff, flat satellite dish sales and rising operating costs were hitting the shares..
