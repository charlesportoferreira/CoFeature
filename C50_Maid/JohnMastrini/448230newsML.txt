czech foreign minister josef zieleniec on monday said his country viewed as frivolous and "absolutely unacceptable" russian hints of economic reprisals for prague's entry into nato.. "we consider it frivolous to connect the expansion of the north atlantic alliance with bilateral (czech russian) relations and threaten economic sanctions in this context," the czech news agency ctk quoted zieleniec as saying.. moscow's ambassador to prague, nikolai ryabov, warned the czech republic on sunday that key bilateral agreements with russia might be jeopardised if it joined nato.. ryabov told russia's ntv commercial television that the former warsaw pact member's entry into the western defence alliance could mean a damaging loss of arms markets for moscow.. the ambassador went on to hint that moscow could reconsider economic deals with prague if it went ahead.. "agreements fundamental to the czech republic, such as gas deliveries and nuclear energy, create a basis for future problems that our countries would face," he said.. zieleniec told ctk that ryabov's statement made it clear why the czechs wanted to join western organisations.. "this type of demand is one of the reasons why it is important...at the earliest, to become a member of the key western political, economic, and security organisations," zieleniec said.. he said he thought the ambassador's interview on russian television was mostly for media consumption.. the czechs, poland and hungary are expected to be named among the first former soviet bloc countries to be invited to join nato at a july summit of the alliance in madrid.. after the collapse of former communist trade arrangements in the early part of the decade, total czech trade turnover with russia grew . percent in to $. billion.. but it was heavily weighted in russia's favour with czech exports to russia at $ million while imports from russia were $. billion.. czechs are still dependent on russia for natural gas and most of their crude oil, but prague is in the final stages of negotiations of a long term contract for some of its gas supplies to come from norway.. last year, the czechs opened the ingolstadt spur in the transalpine crude pipeline from the adriatic sea, providing direct access to crude from the middle east.. the czech power company cez a.s. is also dependent on russian nuclear fuel for its lone atomic power station at dukovany. but the company is expected to take u.s. supplied nuclear fuel when it opens a new plant at temelin by the end of the century.. the czech army is also considering several offers to modernise its mostly soviet era equipment with western made, nato compatible goods..
