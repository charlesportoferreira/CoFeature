a royal navy warship, bristling with weaponry, took up position on the hong kong waterfront on monday to serve as a floating nerve centre for britain's end of empire retreat in just days time.. dodging flimsy sampans and commuter ferries chugging about the famously crowded harbour, the multi role frigate hms chatham berthed beneath glassy skyscrapers alongside the prince of wales barracks in the heart of the metropolis.. there it will tick away the hours, assuming the role of command centre for the british military withdrawal, until china takes back hong kong at the stroke of midnight on june .. after the historic handover, the chatham will escort the departing royal yacht britannia, with prince charles and colonial governor chris patten on board, out of hong kong.. braving one of the hottest and steamiest days so far this summer, captain christopher clayton said he and his crew looked forward to performing an historic task with pride..
