chinese sugar processors have begun hoarding their white sugar in the hope that prices will improve after the two week lunar new year holiday, traders and industry watchers said on wednesday.. "now the factories are reluctant to sell because they want the price to stabilise at a level where they can at least recover their costs," said a chinese trader in hong kong, just returned from the southern sugar producing region of guangdong..
