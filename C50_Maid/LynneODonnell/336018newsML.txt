"that zinc was sold before the rally, but it was still quite expensive," he said.. a futures trader with a state chinese firm in singapore said chinese producers who sold into the market before price rises could well deliver their metal to the lme to record a paper loss, but a healthy profit in the cash market.. "they (producers) would only look at the premium picture," he said. "if physical sells at a nice premium, they could sell their lme position, and sell physical based on lme prices plus a nice premium," he said.. sources in asia said lme price levels over $, a tonne would make chinese exports worthwhile..
