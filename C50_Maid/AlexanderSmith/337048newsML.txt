"what's million pounds to an american bank," said one corporate finance expert, adding that dlj was buying phoenix's british mergers and acquisitions expertise and hoping to use it as a springboard for building up its european business.. others said this was a big price to pay given phoenix's relatively slim revenues and profits. "most people would say it was a pretty racy number," one corporate financier said, adding that dlj was buying a relatively small number of deal makers.. phoenix, whose clients include mutual life insurer scottish amicable, was set up in and was bought by morgan grenfell in . but it regained its independence in through a management buyout led by chairman martin smith and the other founders, philip seers and david reid scott.. the firm has gained a reputation for expertise in financial services. in it advised on transactions worth around . billion pounds and in august last year was ranked second by industry magazine acquisitions monthly in a league table of british based independent corporate finance houses.. philip healey, editor of the magazine, said the sale last october of hambro magan which came top of the table was the catalyst for the phoenix sale.. "that was when boutiques like phoenix decided to put themselves up for sale," he said. hambro magan, whose founder george magan had said it wanted to remain independent, was sold to natwest markets for an estimated to million pounds.. healey said while other boutiques might try to take a similar route, there was nothing of a comparable size to hambro magan or phoenix on offer.. healey said phoenix's directors, who own percent of the company, could be seen as getting out at the top of the booming mergers and acquisitions market.. the new firm, to be called dlj phoenix, would play a leading role in developing dlj's investment banking business in europe and asia. smith will be chairman and all of phoenix's directors and staff will be retained, the two groups said.. phoenix's three founding directors will be tied in to the new venture for four years, while middle management have signed agreements for a two year period.. corporate financiers said this might go some way to ensuring client relationships were maintained, but some pointed out that clients would have opted for phoenix's independent advice over larger product led firms and this could be at threat.. new york based dlj employs , people worldwide and describes itself as the leading distributor of u.s. equity securities to institutional investors outside the united states.. dlj chairman and chief executive john chalsty said phoenix could help the group develop high yield business and target newly emerging companies in eastern europe and russia.. he said dlj had been operating in london for years and was not looking for further acquisitions in the capital.
