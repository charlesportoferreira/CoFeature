dow corning corp. said monday it would set aside up to $ billion to pay silicone breast implant claims under a $ billion bankruptcy reorganization plan but that it also was seeking a trial on whether the implants cause diseases.. dow corning said the plan, filed monday with the u.s. bankruptcy court in bay city, mich., would provide up to an additional $ billion to pay commercial creditors.. the midland, mich. based company, a joint venture between dow chemical co. and corning inc., filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in may because of lawsuits by thousands of women who alleged that their implants have caused a variety of medical problems, including lupus and other autoimmune disorders.. dow corning introduced silicone gel breast implants in and was the largest maker of the products until the food and drug administration imposed a moratorium in .. under the reorganization plan, dow corning said it would set up a $ million fund for out of court settlements. another $. billion would become available for implant claims if it was proven in a trial that implants caused disease.. dow corning said it wanted a jury to hear testimony from a court appointed, independent panel of doctors on the issue and to decide whether the company should compensate claimants.. the company has long held that numerous scientific studies have failed to show a link between the implants and disease.. "we believe the value of breast implant claims should be based on the best and most compelling scientific evidence available," dow corning chairman richard hazleton said in a statement. he added that the plan "provides a fair process to resolve the central legal controversy of whether breast implants cause disease.". plaintiffs said the $ million settlement fund was not enough to address the needs of some , women who have received dow corning implants..
