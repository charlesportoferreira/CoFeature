for the second time in a row, the united auto workers union has chosen ford motor co. to lead the union's labor contract negotiations with the big three u.s. automakers, officials said late on tuesday.. uaw vice president ernest lofton said union leaders notified ford executives of the decision tuesday, but added that the union was not viewing the company as a traditional "strike target" in the talks.. "they are the lead company in regards to resolving our negotiations," lofton said tuesday night in a brief interview on wdiv tv.. the selection will allow the no. u.s. automaker to negotiate an agreement that will serve as a pattern for rivals general motors corp and chrysler corp to follow.. contracts covering nearly , u.s. hourly workers at all three companies expire september . despite the conciliatory talk, ford as the target company faces the threat of a national strike if it fails to reach an agreement before the expiration.. ford spokesman jon harmon would only read the following statement tuesday. "we're hard at work negotiating with the uaw at the subcommittee level as well as at the main table, and we are encouraged by the tone of the negotiations," he said..
