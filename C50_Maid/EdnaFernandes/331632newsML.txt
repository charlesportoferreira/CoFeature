stagecoach plc, the transport group which has seen its share price rocket by percent in the last year, predicted the biggest future growth coming from more acquisitions being made in the rail and bus sector overseas, its chairman told reuters.. brian souter, executive chairman, added that stagecoach's underlying gearing of percent, excluding securitised debt which raises it to percent, was not excessive and that the group was confident it had the financial scope to remain a deal maker. . "we are very comfortable about our gearing levels," said souter, adding "we would be in a position to make a major european acquisiton in the next year if needed.". commenting on how the group could continue to maintain its pacy growth which has helped fuel the share fever in the stock, he said that its european ambitions had been ignited by the swebus bus acquistion last year. stagecoach was looking to make similar acquisitons in countries "clustered in the region". "i also think there'll be overseas railways opportunities. these two will provide the biggest lump of growth in future that's my prediction." . responding to some analysts' comments about the high debt levels, souter said the company expected to have million stg in free cash in two to three years and stressed that percent of its current million of total debt (including securitised loans) was fixed for seven years at . percent..
