building materials and energy group boral ltd reported a lower net profit for the first half year on wednesday, but said it was poised to take advantage of a long awaited upturn in the house building sector.. "the building materials division is now in a position to exploit the upturn," boral managing director tony berg told reporters after announcing the profit fall.. "the upturn will bring profit leverage from improved margins and price improvements and further leverage will come from lowering costs," berg said. . earlier, boral reported a a$. million net profit for the six months to december , down from a$. million in the same period a year earlier. this was due in large part to a a$. million abnormal profit booked from an asset sale in the previous comparable period.. net profit pre abnormals fell to a$ million from a$ million the previous year and compared with market expectations for a pre abnormals net of about a$ million.. analysts said the result was a touch above expectations, largely because of a much stronger result from boral's u.s. building materials operations..
