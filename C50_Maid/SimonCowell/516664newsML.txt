the numbers of names at lloyd's of london, already at year lows, could fall even further after the insurance market said it would raise the amount of capital they must pledge to back their underwriting activities.. the move, which was announced earlier on thursday as part of a package of measures to strengthen lloyd's financial credibility, will fuel fears among the insurance market's traditional backers that names are being eased out in favour of corporate investors.. but andrew duguid, secretary of the lloyd's council, rejected any suggestion of a hidden agenda and said that the purpose of the proposals was to bolster the market's financial security..
