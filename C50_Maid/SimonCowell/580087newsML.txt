"they are terrific operating figures but the nav was a long way short of what the market was expecting," said credit lyonnais insurance analyst david hudson.. the disappointing nav reflected the company's policy of switching out of equities and into bonds. that reduced nav growth because of the absence of unrealised gains but increased operating profits because the higher yield comes through in investment income.. the company's nav of pence per share was some pence below market expectations, said hudson, and the shares slipped five pence to pence by late morning..

"there are some signs on content that rate increases may be being thought about but generally the weather has been good and the homeowners account hasn't suffered unduly.". but general accident had seen a percent increase in subsidence claims to two million pounds, although it was too early to say whether it was going to be as bad as it was in , he said.. after absorbing the integration costs of provident mutual in , life profits were up percent to million pounds.. sales of life and pension products were up . percent overall with the profitability of new business continuing to grow.. new uk single premium business grew by percent to million pounds..
