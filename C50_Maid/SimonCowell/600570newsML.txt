insurance market lloyd's of london will have to wait to find out the implications for it of tuesday's announcement of a shake up in britain's financial services regulatory system.. no decision has yet been reached about where lloyd's will fit into the new regulatory regime which will see the existing system of self regulatory organisations (sros) swept away and replaced by a securities and investments board (sib) with tougher new powers and an extended remit.. only last week the insurance market announced it favoured giving up years of self regulation for supervision by an external authority, specifically the sib.. a treasury spokesman described the labour government as "sympathetic" to the proposals but said that no decision had yet been taken.. "there are a number of areas lloyds, building societies, insurance more generally which are still under discussion as to how they are going to be handled under these new arrangements. we'll have to wait to see how those discussions proceed," said the spokesman.. lloyd's has yet to talk to the government about its proposals which would bring it more into line with other regulated markets and narrow the gap in treatment between it and insurance companies.. under the plans the council would retain day to day responsibility for regulation but be subject to external oversight by the sib and department of trade and industry.. the changes would need legislation to be brought forward to amend both the insurance companies acts and the financial services act.. the government is likely to want all parties involved to take part in discussions and a lloyd's spokesman said it would be "happy to do so"..
