north carolina's attorney general on friday questioned the legal utility of the industry documents liggett group has promised to hand over for use against fellow cigarette companies.. liggett, a unit of brooke group, on thursday agreed as part of a settlement with state governments suing it to deliver internal documents that may help the states press their cases against philip morris and others.. "it's hard to see how liggett group would give up evidence of criminal behaviour," easley said. . easley has not filed a suit like of his peers seeking compensation for billions of dollars spent by state governments on treating sick smokers. he favors a legislative resolution.. north carolina is the biggest tobacco producing state in the country and home to leading manufacturers. its governor has allied with the tobacco industry in fighting federal limits on marketing cigarettes, especially to young people. . the contents of the documents has not been made public. and tobacco company lawyers have secured an order barring the delivery until at least march , when a north carolina state judge will hear arguments on whether not the liggett handover would violate lawyer client privileges for other companies.. easley dismissed as "aggressive" remarks by attorneys general announcing the liggett deal on thursday that the internal documents would be crucial in proving allegations of a conspiracy among the tobacco companies.. a liggett promise to pay percent of pre tax profits for a quarter of a century was worthless, he said, because liggett has not been profitable in many years.. "it would appear that the (plaintiff) attorneys only wanted to get some papers," easley said.. easley backed a bill in the north carolina legislature that would regulate cigarette marketing to children.. the courtroom battles against the tobacco industry would be resolved only by a sweeping new law from washington, easley said..
