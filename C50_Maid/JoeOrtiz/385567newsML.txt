barclays chief executive martin taylor on monday defended the high level of costs at its investment banking unit bzw which contributed to a sharp fall in its profits.. "you have to be careful not to be frightened by your own shadow," taylor told reuters in an interview. "the reason that the returns are depressed this year is that we're spending so much.". taylor said that if barclays had invested less in bzw, the unit's profits would have been higher than the million stg it reported earlier, a percent fall on the previous year. . taylor said that without the investment, bzw would be a weaker firm.. in a statement earlier, barclays admitted underperformance by bzw in the fixed income, with the exception of sterling, and foreign exchange areas.. in foreign exchange, the bank said bzw had performed poorly in an increasingly competitive area.. taylor said barclays had decided in that bzw would not be able to break through and compete without a lot of upgrading.. "there are two phases to that," taylor said. "first of all, assembling a new team, and then getting that team to build the business. the first part has gone quicker than i could have hoped, but it has cost a lot of money.". taylor said bzw would continue to incur quite high costs in the first half of the current year and would then face the disruption of moving its offices to canary wharf in london's docklands.. "i would hope that the second half would be a lot better," he added..
