prudential corp said on tuesday its injection of funds into scottish amicable's life fund had probably clinched its bid for the mutually owned life company, prudential chief executive sir peter davis told reuters.. "our offer used the strength of our balance sheet and the prudential life fund," davis said. "we've put together an imaginative structure with the key difference being the capital injection or support we've offered of up to . billion stg to the (scotam) life fund." . davis said the boost to scotam's fund the company will be run as a completely separate entity under the prudential umbrella will mean that it will be able to have a more flexible investment policy which could include a greater proportion of investments in equities.. this in turn could raise returns.. the . billion stg investment comes from prudential's life fund, which totals billion stg, and will be provided to scotam at a commercial rate.. the merger, creating scottish amicable life, is subject to the approval of policyholders at a special general meeting to be held in june. the proposals will be subject to a percent vote in favour by eligible members. . davis said that on an embedded value or accruals basis, the merger would be earnings enhancing straight away but that on a modified accounting basis, which only takes account of profits on a new policy as bonuses start to be paid, the merger would be slightly dilutive for a couple of years.. the prudential is paying million stg from its shareholders' funds and its life fund. coupled with the injection of up to . billion stg, this will allow the release of around million stg over time from the scotam life fund to its policyholders.. davis said scotam will develop more successfully with prudential's capital backing and is expected to show a larger rate of growth..
