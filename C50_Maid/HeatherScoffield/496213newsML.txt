zaire's civil war should be resolved in africa, without the intervention of the west, the canadian government said on wednesday.. "we're asking for all parties to sit down and discuss and peacefully negotiate a resolution to this," christine stewart, canada's secretary of state for latin america and africa, told the house of commons. "we believe that the africans themselves must come to a peaceful resolution to this problem.". canada's stand contrasted with that of the united states, which signalled on wednesday that zaire's president mobutu sese seko should step down.. rebel forces now control almost half the territory in zaire, the largest country in central africa. although he is under siege and suffering from prostate cancer, mobuto is clinging to power and has declared a state of emergency in the capital kinshasa and the rest of the country.. "the government of canada is not asking the president to leave the country at this time," stewart said. "canada believes that africans have to resolve their problems. obviously western imposed solutions in this area of the world have not succeeded in the past.". she encouraged the countries around zaire to help it resolve its problems.. earlier on wednesday, washington effectively ended a decades old alliance with mobutu. white house spokesman mike mccurry said a negotiated soloution to zaire's civil war must include agreements on interim transitional government arrangements leading ultimately to elections.. "that clearly reflects our view that mobutuism is about to become a creature of history, because the support for president mobutu is not sufficient to lead zaire into the next chaprter of its history," mccurry told reporters.. late last year, canadian soldiers led a multinational force into eastern zaire to aid rwandan refugees fleeing after a revolt by zairean rebels.. the canadian led force was able to do little more than coordinate data from aerial searches for refugees and prepare plans for aid airdrops..
