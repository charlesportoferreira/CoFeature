"i've concluded the only person who could ever make a movie out of this is alfred hitchcock. it's become so bizarre that people have lost any tolerance for staying in," goepel shields analyst rick cohen said in a telephone interview.. adding to the uncertainty was the death of bre x chief geologist michael de guzman, a co discoverer of the busang gold deposit.. de guzman, who fell out of a helicopter on wednesday while flying to the gold site in indonesia's east kalamantan province, was ill and may have committed suicide, indonesian officials said. de guzman's body has not been found.. "obviously, one of the reasons the stock has been under a lot of pressure is because of this mystery of the man's death. he was their chief on site exploration guy...which cast some doubt on the stock," said painewebber analyst marc cohen.. analysts predicted rumors would swirl around busang until freeport issued a statement after completing its review.. citing unnamed sources, indonesia's harian ekonomi neraca newspaper reported on friday that freeport's test results did not match bre x's estimates..
