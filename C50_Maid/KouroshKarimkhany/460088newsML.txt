"we do not expect that the demand weakness we saw in december will recur," said eric benhamou, com chief executive.

"it looks like the worst is behind them, although it could take at least a quarter or two for them to get things back in line," said noel lindsey, analyst at investment bank deutsche morgan grenfell inc. in san francisco.. benhamou's positive remarks also likely will boost com's stock friday, lindsey said.. about percent of com's revenue comes from the sale of networking adapter cards, the graham wafer sized devices that plug into pcs to connect them to networks. com said adapter card revenue rose percent in the third quarter to $. million.. com also sells switches and hubs, the devices that shuffle information through networks. sales of these system products rose percent to $. million.. benhamou said the company is bringing expenses in line with revenue. he also said strong sales throughout asia is offsetting weakness in japan. similarly, strong british sales are mitigating weak sales in germany, he said.. "during the quarter, we saw strong demand for our high end" network equipment, com chairman eric benhamou said in a statement, "and the number of multimillion dollar orders we received from large accounts has never been greater.". "at the same time, our industry is in the midst of many important transitions," benhamou added, citing the adoption of higher speed technologies, new methods for directing network traffic and pricing and distribution increasingly based on volume sales.. he said that as a result of these changes, com's results in the latest quarter reflected increased price competition and a pause in industry demand as corporate networking customers and network service providers assess how to maximize their investments in computer networks.. but he added the changes were "positive for com and the industry in the long run.". the acquisition of u.s. robotics, the leading worldwide maker of modems for the consumer market, will create a company with annual revenues topping $ billion.. under terms of the agreement, each share of skokie, ill. based u.s. robotics will be exchanged for . shares of com stock..
