gal is a general activator of basal transcription, whose activity is regulated by the general repressor sin in yeast.. . mutations in sin, which encodes a global transcriptional regulator in saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been suggested to lead to an increase in basal transcription of various genes by causing an alteration in chromatin structure. we reported previously that this activation of basal transcription occurs via a mechanism that differs from activator mediated transcriptional enhancement. this finding prompted us to seek general activators of basal transcription by screening for extragenic suppressors of a sin mutation using pho, which is activated by the transcriptional activator pho, as a reporter gene. one of the mutations found, the semi dominant abe , is described here. the abe mutation reduced the enhanced basal transcription of pho caused by the sin mutation, but did not impair pho mediated activation of pho. the abe mutation also suppressed the aggregation phenotype and the rough colony morphology of the sin mutant cells, while it exacerbated temperature sensitive growth and telomere shortening, suggesting that abep is involved in the basal transcription not only of pho but also of other diversely regulated genes. swi, which encodes a component of the swi snf complex that has chromatin remodeling activity, was identified as a gene dosage suppressor of the abe mutation. abe was found to be allelic to gal. these observations suggest that gal acts as a general activator for the basal transcription of various genes, possibly by relieving torsional stress in chromatin, and that its function is repressed by the sin protein.
