rna polymerase ii holoenzyme recruitment is sufficient to remodel chromatin at the yeast pho promoter.. . we examine transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling at the pho promoter in yeast by fusion proteins that are thought to act by recruiting the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme to dna in the absence of a classic activating region. these hybrid proteins (e.g., gal+pho or gal( )+pho in the presence of a galp allele) efficiently activated transcription and remodeled chromatin. similar chromatin remodeling was observed at a pho promoter deleted for tata and thus unable to support transcription. we conclude that recruitment of the holoenzyme or associated proteins suffices for chromatin remodeling. we also show that the swi/snf complex is required neither for efficient transcription of the wild type pho nor the gal promoters, and we observe nearly complete chromatin remodeling at pho in the absence of snf.
