the yeast nua and drosophila msl complexes contain homologous subunits important for transcription regulation.. . in drosophila, the msl complex is required for the dosage compensation of x linked genes in males and contains a histone acetyltransferase, mof. a point mutation in the mof acetyl coa binding site results in male specific lethality. yeast esap, a mof homolog, is essential for cell cycle progression and is the catalytic subunit of the nua acetyltransferase complex. here we report that nua purified from yeast with a point mutation in the acetyl coa binding domain of esap exhibits a strong decrease in histone acetyltransferase activity, yet has no effect on growth. we demonstrate that eafp (esap associated factor protein), a yeast protein homologous to the drosophila dosage compensation protein msl, is also a stable component of the nua complex. unlike other subunits of the complex, it is not essential, and the deletion mutant has no growth phenotype. nua purified from the mutant strain has a decreased apparent molecular mass, but retains wild type levels of histone h acetyltransferase activity. the eaf deletion and the esa mutation lead to a decrease in pho gene expression; the eaf deletion also significantly reduces his and trp expressions. these results, together with those previously obtained with both the msl and nua complexes, underscore the importance of targeted histone h acetylation for the gene specific activation of transcription.
