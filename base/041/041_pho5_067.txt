the transcription factor, the cdk, its cyclin and their regulator. directing the transcriptional response to a nutritional signal.. . the pho pho cyclin cdk complex prevents transcription of pho by inhibiting the ability of the basic helix loop helix transcription factor pho to activate transcription in response to high phosphate conditions. in low phosphate the pho pho complex is inactivated and pho is then able to activate the acid phosphatase gene pho. we show here that pho and the homeobox protein pho interact in vivo and act cooperatively to activate the pho uas, with interaction being regulated by the phosphate switch. in addition, we also demonstrate that an additional factor, pho, interacts in high phosphate with both the pho cyclin and with pho. in low phosphate, pho and pho dissociate from pho, but retain the ability to interact with each other. the evidence presented here supports the idea that pho acts as a phosphate sensitive trigger that regulates the ability of the pho pho cyclin cdk complex to bind pho, while dna binding by pho is dependent on the phosphate sensitive interaction with pho.
