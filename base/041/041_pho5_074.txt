[heterologous expression of functionally active human cytochrome p . i. synthesis of cytochrome p iid by transformed saccharomyces cerevisiae cells]. . functionally active human cytochrome p iid was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with yeast expression vectors containing a fragment of the mu plasmid and cytochrome p cdna. transcription was regulated by yeast acid phosphatase pho promoter or chimeric gal cyc promoter. induced yeast cells synthesized cytochrome p that was revealed by the optical absorption of the reduced co form. intact yeast cells were capable to metabolize the drug sparteine forming biotransformation products usually found in human. expression of the human cytochromes p seems to be a promising route to investigate new drugs and to screen genotoxic compounds.
