the two positively acting regulatory proteins pho and pho physically interact with pho upstream activation regions.. . the repressible acid phosphatase gene pho of saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the two positively acting regulatory proteins pho and pho for expression. pho or pho mutants are not able to derepress the pho gene under low pi conditions. here we show that both pho and pho bind specifically to the pho promoter in vitro. gel retardation assays using promoter deletions revealed two regions involved in pho binding. further characterization by dnase i footprinting showed two protected areas, one located at to (relative to the atg initiator codon) (uasp) and the other located at to (uasp). exonuclease iii footprint experiments revealed stops at and (uasp) as well as at and (uasp). gel retardation assays with the pho protein revealed a binding region that lay between the two pho binding sites. dnase i footprint analysis suggested a pho binding site covering the region between and .
