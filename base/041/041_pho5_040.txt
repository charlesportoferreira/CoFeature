integrative transformation of the dimorphic yeast arxula adeninivorans ls based on hygromycin b resistance.. . a transformation system has been developed for the dimorphic yeast arxula adeninivorans based on a stable integration of the donor dna into ribosomal dna. for this purpose a cassette was constructed which contains the e. coli hph gene, conferring hygromycin b resistance, fused to the ' expression signals of the a. adeninivorans tef gene, encoding the translation elongation factor ef alpha, and the transcription termination region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae pho gene. this cassette was fused into the s rdna of a. adeninivorans. linearization of this vector was required for high transformation frequencies. the vector was integrated in multiple copies into the s rdna by homologous recombination. copy number was not altered even after the growth of transformants for generations under non selective growth conditions. microscopical analyses revealed that integration of the transformed plasmid did not influence the dimorphism, which is triggered at degrees c for both transformed and non transformed cells.
