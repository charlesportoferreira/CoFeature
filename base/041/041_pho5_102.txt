constitutive and inducible expression of human cytochrome pia in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. an alternative enzyme source for in vitro studies.. . a cdna of human cytochrome pia was expressed in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae on a multicopy plasmid under the control of the constitutive gapfl or the inducible pho promoter. microsomes of transformed yeast contained substantial amounts of the heterologous enzyme as determined by reduced co difference spectra ( pmol/mg). enzyme kinetics with ethoxyresorufin as substrate resulted in a km value of nm and a vmax value of pmol/mg/min, which is comparable to data obtained with human liver microsomes. the antimycotic drug ketoconazole (ki = nm) as well as the isozyme specific p inhibitor alpha naphthoflavone (ki = . nm) were shown to be strong inhibitors of human pia. taken together, these data show that heterologous p gene expression in yeast is a potent instrument for the study of enzyme specific parameters and might be used to answer further questions with regard to substrate specificity as well as drug interaction in a background with no interfering activities.
