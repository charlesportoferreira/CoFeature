interaction of saccharomyces cerevisiae pho with pho increases the accessibility of the activation domain of pho.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of acid phosphatase, encoded by the pho gene, requires two positive regulatory factors, pho and pho (also called bas or grf). using gal pho fusions, we demonstrate that a functional interaction between these two proteins is necessary for transcriptional activation to occur. this functional interaction between pho and pho is independent of the presence of the negative regulatory factor, pho, which also interacts with pho. interestingly, truncations of pho missing amino acids , which encompass the basic region of the basic helix loop helix (bhlh) dna binding motif, exhibit high transcriptional activation that is independent of the pho molecule. single amino acid mutations of highly conserved residues within this area all display this pho independent phenotype. a region near the c terminus of pho appears to be critical for this interaction with pho. a model to account for the requirement for pho in pho dependent transcriptional activation is proposed.
