increase in gene expression by respiratory deficient mutation.. . respiratory deficient mutants (rho cells) of saccharomyces cerevisiae produced about times as much human (h ) lysozyme as did wild type strains (rho+ cells) when the gal promoter was used in an expression plasmid with the h lysozyme gene. introduction of intact mitochondria into the rho cells resulted in a significant decrease in the production of h lysozyme, indicating that the rho mutation increased the expression of the h lysozyme gene. the copy number of the expression plasmid was not responsible for the increased expression. the level of h lysozyme mrna in the rho cells was also much higher than that in the rho+ cells especially at the stationary phase. the increased expression of the h lysozyme gene was also observed when a glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter and the pho promoter were used in the expression plasmid. the rho mutation also increased the expression of the pho gene under the control of the his promoter in a plasmid and the act gene in the yeast chromosome, but did not increase the expression of the ribosomal rna gene. in contrast to the rho mutants, pet mutants did not show higher gene expression compared with wild type strains.
