secretion of mouse alpha amylase from kluyveromyces lactis.. . we constructed two mouse alpha amylase secretion vectors for kluyveromyces lactis using the well characterized signal sequence of the pgkl kda killer precursor protein. both pho and pgk expression cassettes from saccharomyces cerevisiae directed the expression of mouse alpha amylase in ypd medium at a similar level of efficiency. k. lactis transformants secreted glycosylated and non glycosylated alpha amylase into the culture medium and both species were enzymatically active. the k. lactis/s. cerevisiae shuttle secretion vector pmi was constructed, and k. lactis md/(pmi) secreted about four fold more alpha amylase than s. cerevisiae ynn harboring the same plasmid, indicating that k. lactis is an efficient host cell for the secretion and production of recombinant proteins.
