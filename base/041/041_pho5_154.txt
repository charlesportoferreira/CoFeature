the fos gene product undergoes extensive post translational modification in eukaryotic but not in prokaryotic cells.. . to investigate the properties of the fos oncogene, we have constructed bacterial and yeast vectors which express the entire fos coded protein (fos) and two c terminal deletion products. in escherichia coli, fos proteins were expressed from the phage lambda pl promotor under the control of the temperature sensitive lambda repressor. in vitro transcription/translation studies indicate that these vectors produce fos proteins of the expected sizes. however, in vivo, fos protein accumulation is observed only in hosts with the lon phenotype. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fos gene was expressed from the pho promoter which is induced under low phosphate conditions. in contrast to the situation in e. coli, in which the heterologous proteins appeared as single major products when subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the fos proteins in s. cerevisiae displayed extensive mr heterogeneity. pulse chase analyses indicated that this heterogeneity was a consequence of extensive post translational modification. these modifications occurred to an equivalent extent on the products coded by the fos gene with c terminal deletions and thus appear not to be controlled by the missing domain.
