extremely conserved histone h n terminus is dispensable for growth but essential for repressing the silent mating loci in yeast.. . yeast histone h function was probed in vivo by deleting segments of this extremely conserved amino acid protein. deletions in the hydrophobic core of h are lethal and block chromosomal segregation. in contrast, deletions at the hydrophilic n terminus (residues ) and c terminus (residues ) are viable. however, n terminal deletion alters normal chromatin structure and lengthens the cell cycle, especially g. surprisingly, removal of the h n terminus also derepresses the silent mating type loci, hml alpha and hmra, disrupting mating. this activation is specific since other regulated genes (gal, pho, cup) are repressed and induced normally in these cells. deletions of the hydrophilic n termini of ha or hb do not show this effect on mating. these experiments allow us to define a unique h function that is not shared by other histones (ha and hb).
