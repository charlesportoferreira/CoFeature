histone h n terminal mutations allow hyperactivation of the yeast gal gene in vivo.. . recent work has shown that the yeast histone h n terminus, while not essential for viability, is required for repression of the silent mating loci and activation of gal and pho promoters. because histone h shares many structural features with histone h and is intimately associated with h in the assembled nucleosome, we asked whether h has similar functions. while the basic n terminal domain of h is found to be non essential (deletion of residues of this amino acid protein allows viability), its removal has only a minor effect on mating. surprisingly, both deletions (of residues ) and acetylation site substitutions (at residues , and ) within the n terminus of h allow hyperactivation of the gal promoter as well as a number of other gal regulated genes including gal, gal and gal. to a limited extent glucose repression is also alleviated by h n terminal deletions. expression of another inducible promoter, pho, is shown to be relatively unaffected. we conclude that the h and h n termini have different functions in both the repression of the silent mating loci and in the regulation of gal.
