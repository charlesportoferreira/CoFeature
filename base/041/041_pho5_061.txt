structure function relationships of the yeast cyclin dependent kinase pho.. . the pho gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a cyclin dependent kinase involved in both transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. although a great deal is known concerning the structure, function, and regulation of the highly homologous cdc protein kinase, little is known concerning these relationships in regard to pho. in this study, we constructed a series of pho cdc chimeras to map the region(s) of the pho molecule that is critical for function of pho in repression of acid phosphatase (pho) expression. using a combination of site directed and ethyl methanesulfonate induced mutagenesis, we have identified numerous residues critical for either activation of the pho kinase, interaction of pho with the cyclin like molecule pho, or substrate recognition. finally, analysis of mutations analogous to those previously identified in either cdc or cdc of schizosaccharomyces pombe suggested that the inhibition of pho pho activity in mechanistically different from that seen in the other cyclin dependent kinases.
