expression of a cdna derived from the yeast killer preprotoxin gene. implications for processing and immunity.. . the type i killer strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae secrete a dimeric kda protein that kills sensitive cells by disrupting cytoplasmic membrane function. this toxin is encoded by the double stranded rna plasmid m dsrna, which also determines specific immunity to toxin. a preprotoxin, the kda in vitro translation product of denatured m dsrna, is presumed to be the primary in vivo gene product. to facilitate studies on preprotoxin structure and maturation, we have inserted a partial cdna copy of m dsrna into the yeast vector pa, bringing it under control of the phosphate repressible pho promoter. this in frame gene fusion encodes all of the preprotoxin sequence except for its n terminal secretion leader, which is replaced by the leader sequence of pho. transformation of sensitive yeast strains lacking m dsrna with such fusion plasmids converts them to phosphate repressible, immune killers, demonstrating that both toxin and immunity determinants are contained within the preprotoxin molecule. l tosylamido phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone retards glycosylation of preprotoxin to toxin, facilitating size comparisons and indicating that processing of the normal precursor involves three glycosylation events but does not involve cotranslational leader peptidase action. in contrast, the pho leader is apparently removed from the fusion preprotoxin.
