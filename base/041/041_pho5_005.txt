polyphosphate loss promotes snf/swi and gcn dependent mitotic induction of pho.. . approximately transcripts in saccharomyces cerevisiae are cell cycle regulated. the oscillation of approximately % of these genes, including a prominent subclass involved in nutrient acquisition, is not understood. to address this problem, we focus on the mitosis specific activation of the phosphate responsive promoter, pho. we show that the unexpected mitotic induction of the pho acid phosphatase in rich medium requires the transcriptional activators pho and pho, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor pho, and the chromatin associated enzymes gcn and snf/swi. pho mitotic activation is repressed by addition of orthophosphate, which significantly increases cellular polyphosphate. polyphosphate levels also fluctuate inversely with pho mrna during the cell cycle, further substantiating an antagonistic link between this phosphate polymer and pho mitotic regulation. moreover, deletion of phm, required for polyphosphate accumulation, leads to premature onset of pho expression, as well as an increased rate, magnitude, and duration of pho activation. orthophosphate addition, however, represses mitotic pho expression in a phmdelta strain. thus, polyphosphate per se is not necessary to repress pho transcription but, when present, replenishes cellular phosphate during nutrient depletion. these results demonstrate a dynamic mechanism of mitotic transcriptional regulation that operates mostly independently of factors that drive progression through the cell cycle.
