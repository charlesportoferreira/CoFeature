increasing the rate of chromatin remodeling and gene activation a novel role for the histone acetyltransferase gcn.. . histone acetyltransferases (hats) such as gcn play a role in transcriptional activation. however, the majority of constitutive genes show no requirement for gcn, and even regulated genes, such as the yeast pho gene, do not seem to be affected significantly by its absence under normal activation conditions. here we show that even though the steady state level of activated pho transcription is not affected by deletion of gcn, the rate of activation following phosphate starvation is significantly decreased. this delay in transcriptional activation is specifically due to slow chromatin remodeling of the pho promoter, whereas the transmission of the phosphate starvation signal to the pho promoter progresses at a normal rate. chromatin remodeling is equally delayed in a galactose inducible pho promoter variant in which the pho binding sites have been replaced by gal binding sites. by contrast, activation of the gal gene by galactose addition occurs with normal kinetics. lack of the histone h n termini leads to a similar delay in activation of the pho promoter. these results indicate that one important contribution of hats is to increase the rate of gene induction by accelerating chromatin remodeling, rather than to affect the final steady state expression levels.
