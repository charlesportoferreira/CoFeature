at least base pairs of ' flanking dna is required for the correct expression of the ho gene in yeast.. . homothallic yeast cells undergo a specific pattern of mating type switching initiated by an endonuclease encoded by the ho gene. ho transcription is affected by cell type (a, alpha, and a/alpha), by cell age (mother or daughter), and by the cell cycle. this paper investigates the sequences involved in ho transcription by replacing genomic dna with copies mutated in vitro. a region between and (called urs) is necessary for transcription in addition to a &quot;tata&quot; like region at . the bp of dna separating urs from the &quot;tata&quot; box is not necessary for transcription nor for a/alpha repression and some measure of mother/daughter control, but it is necessary for correct cell cycle control.
