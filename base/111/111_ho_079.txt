meiotic recombination initiated by a double strand break in rad delta yeast cells otherwise unable to initiate meiotic recombination.. . meiotic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae is initiated by double strand breaks (dsbs). we have developed a system to compare the properties of meiotic dsbs with those created by the site specific ho endonuclease. ho endonuclease was expressed under the control of the meiotic specific spo promoter, creating a dsb at a single site on one of yeast's chromosomes. in rad+ strains the times of appearance of the ho induced dsbs and of subsequent recombinants are coincident with those induced by normal meiotic dsbs. physical monitoring of dna showed that spo. . ho induced gene conversions both in rad+ and in rad delta cells that cannot initiate normal meiotic dsbs. we find that the rad gene is important, but not essential, for recombination even after a dsb has been created in a meiotic cell. in rad delta cells, some dsbs are not repaired until a broken chromosome has been packaged into a spore and is subsequently germinated. this suggests that a broken chromosome does not signal an arrest of progression through meiosis. the recombination defect in rad delta diploids is not, however, meiotic specific, as mitotic rad diploids, experiencing an ho induced dsb, exhibit similar departures from wild type recombination.
