relation between the efficiency of homothallic switching of yeast mating type genes and the distribution of cell types.. . homothallic switching of yeast mating type genes occurs as often as each cell division, so that a colony derived from a single haploid spore soon contains an equal number of mata and mat alpha cells. cells of opposite mating types conjugate, and eventually the colony contains only nonmating mata/mat alpha diploids. mutations that reduce the efficiency of homothallic mat conversions yield colonies that still contain many haploid cells of the original spore mating type plus a few recently generated cells of the opposite mating type. these (a greater than alpha) or (alpha greater than a) mating colonies also contain some nonmating diploid cells. as an alternative to microscopic pedigree analysis to determine the frequency of mating type conversions in a variety of mutant homothallic strains, we analyzed the proportions of mata, mat alpha, and mata/mat alpha cells in a colony by examining the mating phenotypes of subclones. we developed a mathematical model that described the proportion of cell types in a slow switching colony. this model predicted that the proportion of nonmating cells would continually increase with the size (age) of a colony derived from a single cell. this prediction was confirmed by determining the proportion of cell types in colonies of an ho swi strain that was grown for different numbers of cell divisions. data from subcloning (a greater than alpha) and (alpha greater than a) colonies from a variety of slow switching mutations and chromosomal rearrangements were used to calculate the frequency of mat conversions in these strains.
