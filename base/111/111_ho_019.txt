post transcriptional regulation through the ho ' utr by mpt, a yeast homolog of pumilio and fbf.. . drosophila pumilio (pum) and caenorhabditis elegans fbf bind to the ' untranslated region (' utr) of their target mrnas and repress translation. pum and fbf are members of a large and evolutionarily conserved protein family, the puf family, found in drosophila, c.elegans, humans, and yeasts. budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, has five proteins with conserved puf motifs. mpt/uth, yglw, yllc, jsn, and yprc. here we report that mpt negatively regulates expression of the ho gene. loss of mpt increased expression of reporter genes integrated into the ho locus, whereas overexpression of mpt decreased expression. repression required the ' utr of ho, which contains a tetranucleotide, uugu, also found in the binding sites of pum and fbf. mutation of uugu to uacu in the ho ' utr abolished mpt mediated repression. studies using a three hybrid assay for rna binding indicate that mpt binds to the ' utr of ho mrna containing a uugu sequence but not a uacu sequence. these observations suggest that the yeast puf homolog, mpt, negatively regulates ho expression post transcriptionally.
