homothallic mating type switching generates lethal chromosome breaks in rad strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in homothallic cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae, a or alpha mating type information at the mating type locus (mat) is replaced by the transposition of the opposite mating type allele from hml alpha or hmra. the rad mutation, which reduces mitotic and abolishes meiotic recombination, also affects homothallic switching (malone and esposito, proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. . , ). we have found that both ho rad mata and ho rad mat alpha cells die. this lethality is suppressed by mutations that substantially reduce but do not eliminate homothallic conversions. these mutations map at or near the mat locus (mat alpha inc, mata inc, mata stk) or are unlinked to mat (ho and swi). these results suggest that the switching event itself is involved in the lethality. with the exception of swi, ho rad strains carrying one of the above mutations cannot convert mating type at all. mat alpha rad ho swi strains apparently can switch mat alpha to mata. however, when we analyzed these a maters, we found that few, if any, of them were bona fide mata cells. these a like cells were instead either deleted for part of chromosome iii distal to and including mat or had lost the entire third chromosome. approximately % of the time, an a like cell could be repaired to a normal mata genotype if the cell was mated to a rad mat alpha inc strain. the effects of rad were also studied in mata/mat alpha inc rad/rad ho/ho diploids. when this diploid attempted to switch mata to mata, an unstable broken chromosome was generated in nearly every cell. these studies suggest that homothallic switching involves the formation of a double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid break or a structure which is labile in rad cells and results in a broken chromosome. we propose that the production of a double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid break is the lethal event in rad ho cells.
