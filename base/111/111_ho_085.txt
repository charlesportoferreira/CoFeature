association of yeast sin with the tetratrico peptide repeats of cdc.. . the yeast sin protein is a nuclear protein that together with other proteins behaves as a transcriptional repressor of a family of genes. in addition, sin mutants are defective in proper mitotic chromosome segregation. in an effort to understand the basis for these phenotypes, we employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with sin in vivo. here we demonstrate that cdc, a protein known to be involved in sister chromatid separation during mitosis, is able to directly interact with sin. furthermore, using recombinant molecules in vitro, we show that the n terminal of sin is sufficient to bind a portion of cdc consisting solely of tetratrico peptide repeats. earlier experiments identified the c terminal domain of sin to be responsible for interaction with a protein that binds the regulatory region of ho, a gene whose transcription is repressed by sin. taken together with the results presented here, we suggest that sin is a chromatin protein having at least a dual function. the n terminal of sin interacts with the tetratrico peptide repeat domains of cdc, a protein involved in chromosome segregation, whereas the c terminal of sin binds proteins involved in transcriptional regulation.
