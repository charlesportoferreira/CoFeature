structure of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ho gene and analysis of its upstream regulatory region.. . the ho gene product of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a site specific endonuclease that initiates mating type interconversion. we have determined the nucleotide sequence of a , base pair (bp) segment containing ho. the segment contains a single long open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of amino acids, which has unusual (unbiased) codon usage and is preceded by bp of upstream region. the predicted ho protein is basic (% lysine and arginine) and is calculated to have a secondary structure that is % helical. the corresponding transcript is initiated approximately nucleotides prior to the presumed initiation codon. insertion of an escherichia coli lacz gene fragment into the putative ho coding segment inactivated ho and formed a hybrid ho lacz gene whose beta galactosidase activity was regulated by the mating type locus in the same manner as ho (repressed by a alpha ). upstream regions of , and bp conferred strong repression; bp led to partial constitutivity and bp to full constitutivity. thus, dna sequences that confer repression of ho by a alpha are at least nucleotides upstream of the transcription start point and are within nucleotides of the ho initiation codon. the progressive loss of repression suggests that both the to and the to intervals contain sites for regulation by a alpha . the ho gene contains two distinct regions that promote autonomous replication of plasmids in s. cerevisiae. these regions contain sequences that are homologous to the two conserved sequences that are associated with ars activity.
