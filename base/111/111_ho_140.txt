a negative regulator of ho transcription, sin (spt), is a nonspecific dna binding protein related to hmg.. . the sin gene was initially identified because mutations in sin bypass the need for swi to activate transcription of the yeast ho gene. we show here that transcription of ho in swi sin cells efficiently utilizes the normal start site. we have cloned sin and found that it is identical to the previously identified gene spt, mutations in which allow transcription from certain mutated regulatory regions. the predicted sin/spt protein has a distinctive amino acid composition (% charged residues, % basic and % acidic) and has similarity to the mammalian hmg protein, a nonhistone component of chromatin. we show that sin is concentrated in the nucleus and binds to dna with little or no sequence specificity in vitro. it thus exhibits properties of an hmg protein. addition of random dna segments to a test promoter alters regulation by sin in a manner similar to addition of a segment from the ho upstream region. functional analysis of certain sin mutations suggests that sin may be part of a multiprotein complex. on the basis of these results, we propose that sin is a nonhistone component of chromatin which creates the proper context for transcription. because sin mutants exhibit increased loss of chromosome iii, sin may also play a role in fidelity of chromosome segregation.
