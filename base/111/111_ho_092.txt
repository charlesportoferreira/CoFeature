dna synthesis errors associated with double strand break repair.. . repair of a site specific double strand dna break (dsb) resulted in increased reversion frequency for a nearby allele. site specific dsbs were introduced into the genome of saccharomyces cerevisiae by the endonuclease encoded by the ho gene. expression of the ho gene from a galactose inducible promoter allowed efficient dna cleavage at a single site in large populations of cells. to determine whether the dna synthesis associated with repair of dsbs has a higher error rate than that associated with genome duplication, ho induced dsbs were generated . kb from revertible alleles of trp. the reversion rate of the trp alleles was approximately fold higher among cells that had experienced an ho cut than among uninduced cells. the reverted allele was found predominantly on the chromosome that experienced the dna cleavage.
