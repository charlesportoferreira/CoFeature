british banks have developed a greater understanding of the needs of small firms, but much remains to be done to finance the sector, the bank of england (boe) said in a report released on wednesday.. "relationships between small firms and their banks have improved greatly from a low point four years ago. the question is how much of this improvement is due simply to economic recovery, and how much to structural change," howard davies, the central bank's deputy governor, said in a statement.. davies said while there had been genuine changes and banks did now better understand the needs of their small firm customers, there was "a lot more to do".. he said two areas that would receive particular attention were the financing of small exporters and the problems faced by ethnic minority businesses.. the report found that while bank finance continued to be the main form of external finance used by small firms described by the bank as small businesses with a turnover up to and including a million pounds a year asset backed finance accounted for "a steadily increasing proportion".. factors and invoice discounters reported strong growth during and there was an increase of percent in the number of firms using the services they offer.. factoring is a credit collection service whereby a company sells its receivables, the outstanding debts due to it, to a factor at a discount. the factor then collects the funds owed and earns a profit via the discount while the company benefits from an improved cash flow.. in the field of bank finance, the report found there was more reliance on the business proposition and less on collateral as well as a rebuilding of relationships between banks and small business customers a move from overdrafts to term loans.. such loans "now account for around two thirds (by value) of the total of billion pounds of bank lending to small firms," the report said.. despite these changes, the bank's report found that the range of margins paid on small business borrowing did not change significantly during .
