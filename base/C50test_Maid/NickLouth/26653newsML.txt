at the end of this month, at&amp;t corp. will finally untether lucent technologies inc. as a separate company, a year after the telecommunications behemoth first said it would split into three businesses.. for some of at&amp;t's . million shareholders it has more than any other u.s. corporation it may be a confusing time.. telecom equipment maker lucent already had an initial public offering of stock in april, but on sept. at&amp;t stock will be shorn of the rights to the remaining . percent of lucent shares.. at&amp;t will then made up only of the telecommunications services and computing businesses. the last part of the three way split up will be around the end of , when shareholders receive stock in computing company ncr.. existing shareholders on sept. will receive one new lucent share for about every three at&amp;t shares they hold, and if they intend to hold both stocks, they need do nothing.. but the confusion arises because of the necessity to create two new classes of stock one for the rump portion of at&amp;t and one for lucent in the weeks leading up to the sept. split.. the new york stock exchange said that these classes of temporary "when issued" stock which are rights to the respective new shares will effectively form a market in the new companies before formal trading begins..
