"this is something that our firms are primarily concerned about, that they raised with us, and yet it is something that we in the government are concerned about, and we want to talk to the relevant authorities on the hong kong side," boucher said.. "we have (talked) in the past and we will continue to talk to them, as our companies have, to try to work out this problem, so that hong kong has efficient, competitive and commercially reasonable rates and a setup here that works both in a commercial sense and in terms of a competitive sense as well.". airlines have said recently landing costs could be three to four times higher than at the present kai tak airport, and even the airport authority has said overall fees may nearly double.. industry analysts and some airlines, such as taiwan's china airlines, have said the rises could hurt their profit margins, push up ticket prices, or force traffic to other airports at nearby macau or china's zhuhai and shenzhen.. hong kong secretary for economic services stephen ip said airport officials were still consulting the airlines..
