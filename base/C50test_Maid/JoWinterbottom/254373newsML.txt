the remaining independent british regional electricity companies (recs) could become fair game for predators as the british government approved on friday a hostile bid for northern electric from u.s. based ce electric.. shares in the only three remaining recs which are not currently subject to bids southern, london and yorkshire gained strongly as the market speculated further offers would emerge.. the government cleared ce electric's pence per share bid earlier on friday with some conditions aimed at clearing up financial queries, lifting a cloud of uncertainty which had kept northern's shares languishing around pence.. "this is the green light for other bids to emerge," said fraser mclaren, analyst at greig middleton.. northern shares closed /p higher at p after peaking at pence and analysts said the million pound ($. billion) bid from ce, which is percent owned by calenergy, was likely to be successful.. london rose / pence to and southern gained / pence to with yorkshire putting on / pence to .. east midlands electricity, which has agreed to a $. billion takeover by dominion resources of the u.s. at pence per share, strode / pence higher to as the market assumed approval for this less contentious bid.. seven of the original cash rich recs have fallen to predators since they came up for grabs in march when the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in .. three of these south western, seeboard and midlands have already been sold to u.s. companies and american firms are hotly tipped to be potential buyers of other recs as they are attracted by easier regulation and expertise in supply..

"southern has formidable firepower and so any bid would probably have to be agreed and could be a joint effort by two companies," said nigel hawkins of yamaichi.. london and yorkshire would cost a predator up to around . billion pounds each, analysts added, at levels of above pence and pence per share respectively.. "that's a price which could be contemplated by a company if it were to want a foothold in the uk supply market," said one analyst who asked not to be named. london has already had discussions with u.s. group entergy, which called off talks in november but said it still considered britain an "attractive market.". houston industries of the united states, which tried but failed to secure control of rec norweb with central &amp; south west corp in october .. central &amp; south west eventually bought seeboard but speculation continues that houston might still be interested in a british rec..
