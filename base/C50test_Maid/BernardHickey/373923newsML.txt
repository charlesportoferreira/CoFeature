the commonwealth bank of australia (cba) announced a surprisingly strong percent rise in first half profits on wednesday as a percent surge in business lending more than offset a further squeeze in home loan margins.. "business volumes during the first half of / were pleasing, leading to a better than expected interim result," cba managing director david murray told a news conference.. "this likely to lead to a slightly better than expected full year result," murray said. . cba's net profit for the six months to december rose to a$ million from a$ million in the comparable six months a year earlier.. cba had itself been saying until now that it expected competition in its key home loan market would squeeze home loan margins and keep profits flat in the year to june , .. analysts too had expected a subdued profit performance, forecasting a profit of between a$ million and a$ million.. cba's shares rallied sharply on the profit and on news of a interim dividend of cents per share, up seven cents on the previous interim dividend. . cba's shares were up cents at a$. at . p.m. ( gmt), helping to drive the share market overall to a new record high. "obviously the market liked it. the profit was probably about a$ million above expectations and there was a nice increase in the dividend," said lance jones dealer hamish dee.. cba said the launch of its business asset finance and capital business card products in july and october had attracted significant new business. . but cba dampened optimism about its business lending boom by cutting its varible home mortgage rates by up to . of a percentage point, ensuring further margin pressure on australia's largest home lender..
