air france announced on monday the start of a transatlantic alliance with two major u.s. carriers, delta air lines and continental, as part of a strategy to form global links vital to the french state owned carrier's future.. delta and continental unveiled registration facilities at air france's central hub at paris charles de gaulle airport, marking the official transfer of flights and operations from paris orly airport.. the alliances were announced last october.. under the move, air france's global hub at charles de gaulle is now linked to five major u.s. hubs new york's jfk airport, atlanta and cincinnati belonging to delta and new york newark and houston belonging to continental.. "through our partnership with air france, we see a very good opportunity to flow traffic over the delta hubs in the u.s. to paris and beyond (the) air france cdg hub," bob coggins, delta's executive vice president for marketing told reporters.. besides the move from orly to the more modern and spacious facilities at charles de gaulle, the alliances allow the u.s. and french firms to share frequent flyer programmes and share revenues on feeder and transatlantic flights.. the main benefit will come when air france links its schedules with delta and continental through a formal code sharing programme, barry simon, continental's senior vice president international said.. code sharing allows one airline to issue a through ticket using a connecting flight on its partner's network. such deals can significantly increase traffic at low cost.. but air france cannot sign up a code sharing pact until the french and u.s. governments agree a bilateral air treaty. the u.s. authorities seek substantial liberalisation, including the right to fly from a domestic city to france and onward to a destination in a third country..
