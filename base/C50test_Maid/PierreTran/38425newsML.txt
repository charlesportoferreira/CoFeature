troubled eurotunnel sa/plc releases first half results on monday but analysts contacted by reuters said any attempt to forecast the figures was futile, given the uncertainties overhanging its debt restructuring.. "everything depends on resolving the financial situation. if they announce a good figure...that might help, but it's really a face off between the company and the bankers," olivier machou, analyst at brokerage leven said.. it was hard to forecast results due to "dumping" in eurotunnel's bitter price war with the ferries, he added.. one analyst said, "it's not a stock that you can take a view based on half year figures, especially as the first half comes before the summer season.". a london based broker said, "it's not worth forecasting, everything hangs on the debt talks, which will take forever. it will happen when it happens.". however, one analyst at a large french brokerage said he had a rough forecast of a . billion franc net loss and an operating loss of around million.. eurotunnel needs to agree a refinancing of its bank debt by the end of september, having asked in july for two court appointed mediators to stay on to negotiate a deal with its some strong bank syndicate.. the channel tunnel operator posted first half sales of . billion francs, up from million a year ago.. it made a net loss for full year of . billion francs on turnover of . billion.. the headline figures will likely be flattered by the fact that eurotunnel did not have all its services running a year ago, said jeff summers, head of research at debt specialist klesch and co in london.. stripping out the minimum usage fee that the railway operators pay, he expected a percent improvement in the underlying results from a year ago.. in sterling terms, summers has pencilled in a million pretax, pre interest loss versus million a year ago. with benign currency movements, it may break even.. operating cashflow should at least double to million stg before interest and capital expenditure, compared to million.. "everything is going in its favour," summers said. he cited the british government's recent decision to allow cooperation between ferry companies to pool their capacity and the european commission's decision not to extend the duty free sales regime beyond .. pooling by rivals such as p&amp;o and stena would lead to "a reduction in direct competition" for eurotunnel, while the loss of duty free sales, representing million stg of soft subsidies for the ferries, would push ferry firms to raise ticket prices.. eurotunnel could then raise its prices and boost turnover.. the cross channel market has also grown much faster even than eurotunnel forecast, with traffic up percent last year and estimated growth of percent this year, summers said.. moreover, richard branson, head of the london &amp; continental railways (lcr) group which runs the eurostar high speed train concession, has forecast it will hit six million passengers in the financial year / and million in months.. if that happens, eurotunnel could receive revenues above the minimum usage fee as higher service levels trigger extra payments.. paris newsroom + .
