"for the time being, we're being modest.". portuguese interests dominated the sector until angola sank into civil war following independence in . most of / exports came from southern farms but percent of potential coffee production lay in the north in unita areas largely closed to access, lutucuta added.. "what is certain is that access roads are mined," he said. "plantation roads themselves are not, except for a few where unita had camped and placed them for security.". military mine clearance units set up in are working in each province under local government control..
