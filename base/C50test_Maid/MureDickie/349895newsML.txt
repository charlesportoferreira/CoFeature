china and the united states reached agreement on sunday to extend a deal on textiles, averting a multi billion dollar trade war, an official with china's ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation said.. "the two sides will be signing the agreement in a ceremony shortly," the official said by telephone.. the eleventh hour agreement followed marathon all night talks between u.s. chief textile negotiator rita hayes and a team of chinese officials on renewal of a textile accord and resolution of a dispute over u.s. penalties on chinese textile exports.. hayes had said on saturday she was confident of accord in last ditch talks after extending by a day a january deadline for multi million dollar penalties on china's exports.. the sino u.s. textile pact had been scheduled to expire on december but was extended by one month to give both sides time to hammer out a compromise.. washington slapped $ million worth of penalties on imports of chinese textiles last september, saying beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.. china has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some u.s. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.. hayes said earlier issues at the forefront in the final rounds of talks were two major demands the u.s. market access package and a level playing field for the textile industry.. disagreement over market access in china appeared to be a major stumbling block, industry representatives said earlier.. washington could have made significant cuts to china's textile quotas if an agreement had not been reached before the deadline.. washington and beijing were also seeking to ease tensions in the dispute over chinese exports of textiles via third countries..
