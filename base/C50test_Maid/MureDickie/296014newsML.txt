china on thursday ordered two airliners from u.s. aviation giant boeing co in a multimillion dollar deal that washington's ambassador to china said was hastened by upcoming visits by u.s. congressmen.. the two jets would be powered by engines from pratt and whitney, a subsidiary of united technologies corp, and would be delivered in to air china, beijing's international carrier, officials of the china aviation supplies corp said.. closure of the $ million contract, which follows the purchase of three s by air china in july last year, had been hastened by imminent visits to beijing of about u.s. congressmen, said u.s. ambassador james sasser.. "this boeing contract is something that has been under discussion for some time," sasser told reporters. "clearly there was an effort to try to finalise this transaction on the eve of the visit of a number of senators and congressmen.". one official bipartisan delegation of around u.s. congressmen is scheduled to arrive in beijing next week for talks with chinese officials that are expected to include touchy issues such as the sino u.s. trade balance and human rights.. relations between washington and beijing have long been battered by disputes over trade, taiwan, copyright piracy and china's human rights record, but both sides say ties warmed in the latter half of .. chinese efforts to ease beijing's swelling and highly sensitive trade surplus with the united states were likely to provide a boost to u.s. exports to china, sasser said..

"we are just very encouraged and optimistic about our long term relationship with china," abel told reuters.. a boeing statement said the two passenger combis it would supply to air china marked a strong vote of confidence in the u.s. planemaker from an airline that already operated of its aircraft.. officials of the state run china air supplies corp also welcomed the deal, although they identified the ordered aircraft as seat s..
