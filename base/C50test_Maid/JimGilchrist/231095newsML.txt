the international air transport association (iata) said on tuesday it supports plans for a single air traffic control centre to cover all airports in the fast growing pearl river delta region in southern china.. iata director general pierre jeanniot told the hong kong international aerospace forum that all three existing air traffic service providers in hong kong, china and macau had indicated acceptance of the concept after a recent meeting in guangzhou.. jeanniot told reuters after his speech that all airlines would benefit from a unified air traffic control through lower costs, faster transit times for overflights and reduced pilot workload.. however he could give no timescale for when the concept might be introduced, where an overall centre would be based or how much it would cost.. "three air traffic control centres can be very inefficient and potentially dangerous. it is at a busy cross roads and it is important that local capacity is coordinated. there is agreement now that it would be better if control was integrated. the concept has been agreed in principle that it needs to be done. discussions are ongoing," jeanniot said.. air traffic is continuously increasing in the pearl river delta region with large airports at guangzhou and shenzhen and new airports at zhuhai and in the nearby portuguese enclave of macau.. also within a few minutes flying time is one of the world's busiest airports in hong kong at kai tak, which will be replaced in by chek lap kok airport offering even more capacity, industry sources said. air cargo newsroom tel+ fax + ..
