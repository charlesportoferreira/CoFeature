"i can assure you the minister of transport, the cabinet and the prime minister are aware of air canada's desires and ambitions," durrett said.. when asked when a breakthrough might be expected, durrett said. "we will continue our lobbying effort but it is very difficult to say. the only indication we have had from ottawa is that we would probably get the increase when the new airport opens (at chek lap kok due in april )," he added.. air canada currently uses boeing combi aircraft on the hong kong route but durrett ruled out increasing passenger capacity by using a boeing , saying a daily service was the solution.. air cargo newsroom tel+ fax+ .
