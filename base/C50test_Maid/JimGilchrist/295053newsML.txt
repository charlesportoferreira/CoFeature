eva air is planning to start a new freighter service from taipei to brussels later this year, airline spokesman k. w. nieh has told reuters.. at the same time, the taiwanese carrier is also planning to replace its mcdonnell douglas md freighter service from taipei to amsterdam via dubai with an md combi aircraft, nieh said in an interview.. "we propose the new md freighter service to brussels starting in may or june using the aircraft that is being replaced by the combi aircraft on the amsterdam service," nieh said.. in a further expansion of its cargo business, eva will also take delivery of two more mcdonnell douglas md freighters by the end of this year, along with the first of two new boeing passenger aircraft, bringing eva's all md freighter fleet to five. eva's current fleet of aircraft is due to rise to by next year with the two md freighters and two purchases along with two mcdonnell douglas md shorthaul passenger twinjets, nieh added.. he said the new freighters will be used to expand cargo revenue which is already expected to be more than per cent of the airline's total revenue when last year's financial figures are published in march.. eva has not yet chosen which routes the two new freighters will operate on but chicago is a possibility to supplement existing freighter services to new york and seattle. eva also operates combi flights into los angeles and san francisco, nieh added.. "we hope we can use our new freighters to the united states but it depends on traffic rights and government negotiations regarding america's open skies policy. we hope an agreement can be reached later this year, once that happens we could apply for chicago," nieh said.. eva has no plans to start a dedicated freighter service from the taiwanese capital to hong kong which is now served by passenger flights a week partly using combi aircraft, the spokesman added. air cargo newsroom tel+ fax+ .
