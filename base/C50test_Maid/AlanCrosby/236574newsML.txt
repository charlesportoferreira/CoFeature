the prague stock exchange continued to gain ground on thursday, but analysts said they were not convinced the beleaguered bourse's fortunes had turned around, attributing the rise to thin domestic buying.. the bourse has showed signs of rebounding recently gaining in of the past sessions. but analysts saw little change in market sentiment amid mostly domestic trading as investment funds settled positions before the end of the year.. "this doesn't really look like a rebound to me. (mainly) there's a bit of domestic buying and some of the local brokers are just bidding up the market," alex angell of the brokerage wood and company said.. the px index closed up . percent at . at its daily price fixing on thursday, putting the bourse about nine percent higher than its low in mid november.. the pse stumbled through most of the autumn, losing close to percent as key investors sold positions, tired of a market characterised as unregulated and murky.. although eastern europe's most capitalised bourse, the czech market has long been plagued by poor legislation that investors say fails to provide protection for minority shareholders.. under the czech republic's securities act, devised to handle the logistics of the government's massive voucher privatisation scheme, the securities registry (scp) is bound by law to provide services such as moving securities to and from client accounts.. since the scp does not reveal any details of transactions, including prices and volumes, local brokers have taken to the scp because of its privacy and faster settlement process.. but this has restrained activity on the pse which sees on average $ million of stock turnover each day, compared with $ million in warsaw, a much smaller market.. "there are clearly investors who have decided to stay away from this market because of its opaqueness and are still on the sidelines," said one international trader.. "this is the case especially at the end of the year when a lot of local funds push prices all over the place in order to get a desired result on their books for the year," he added.. but many analysts said that hope is not lost for the bourse.. they expected investors to buy back into the market as the downtrend bottoms out, although maybe not before the end of the year.. "i expect most of the buying to come in the new year, but i think it means that investors already familiar with the market should do something now," said danial gladis, head of the brokerage atlantik financni trhy.. market officials have also begun taking steps to correct the problems which should slowly lure back disenchanted investors.. in april, parliament approved a series of market reforms to compel companies and fund managers to be more open and accountable. a key element tackles the chronic problem of slow and irregular reporting of company earnings and actions.. the pse itself has taken several steps to brings more transparency to the market, stressing in particular the need for the early creation of an independent watchdog, though analysts said a lack of political will to establish the body remains..
