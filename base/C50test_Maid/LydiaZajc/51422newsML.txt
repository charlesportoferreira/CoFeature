"our purpose here is to attract additional business from asia so we're looking, quite frankly, to get ... investment from asia into these companies," courtney said. "it's an extension of a number of asian pacific initiatives we've had under way," which included marketing trips.. some canadian brokerages will get involved. "we don't have every single vse member committed to the programme but we do have a kind of a critical mass to start the trading," courtney said. trading partners include toronto dominion's discount service green line and levesque beaubien geoffrion.. overseas brokerages will also be able to participate. international brokerages can gain associate status through vse members and trade using special reuters and bloomberg terminals, courtney said.. as of yet none are confirmed but several have applied, she added.. canadian brokerages seem to be approaching this development cautiously. diane ratte, midland walwyn capital inc's senior vice president and director of equity trading, said the brokerage would not staff the new session. "at the present time, no. we're going to sit back and see what happens.". "i didn't get the impression that too many of the firms were going to be actively involved. i got the impression that most of the firms are going to take that attitude sit back and wait," ratte said.. courtney said the vse is hoping for a low key start but expects trading to build up. "we're looking for a gradual evolution of this trading session.".
