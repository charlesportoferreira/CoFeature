a bill to protect homeowners from paying unneccessary mortgage insurance was passed overwhelmingly by the house of representative wednesday.. by a vote of to seven, the house adopted the homeowners insurance protection act that would cancel mortgage insurance once the homeowner has built up sufficient equity.. "the truth is that a vast number of people are paying for insurance they no longer need," representative henry gonzalez said during the debate on the bill. the texas democrat urged the senate to quickly pass the measure.. consumer advocates say these policies cost homeowners millions of dollars a year.. "i think it would be hard for the senate to resist moving forward," michelle meier, counsel for government affairs at consumers union, said. the house vote "brings us really close to getting a final measure.". but the mortgage insurance industry warned that the automatic cancellation proposal would raise the cost for loans with low downpayments.. "unfortunately, the bill has serious flaws that would impose unnecessary government mandates and controls on the industry," said suzanne hutchinson of the mortgage insurance companies of america.. currently, mortgage lenders require a borrower to obtain and pay for such insurance when the borrower is making a relatively small down payment, such as percent of the purchase price of a home.. borrowers putting down percent or more of the purchase price generally are not required to obtain insurance, which can cost $ to $ a year.. the bill would automatically cancel a mortgage insurance policy if the homeowner was current on mortgage payments and had built up percent equity of the original house value.. the bill would not not apply to existing mortgages. the new rules would cover only mortgages and refinancings closed a year after enactment..
