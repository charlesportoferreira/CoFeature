federal reserve chairman alan greenspan urged lawmakers on thursday to put off consideration of controversial proposals that would allow banks to merge with commercial companies, such as carmakers.. instead, he said congress should press ahead with more modest financial reforms that would knock down the year old legal barriers that prevent banks from affiliating with insurance companies and securities firms.. "congress should widen the permissible range of affiliations for banking organizations in order to expand the choices for consumers and increase the efficiency of financial markets," greenspan told the house banking committee.. technology and free market competition are blurring the boundries between financial and non financial companies, but congress can afford to wait, greenspan said..

"it's already out there," said karen shaw petrou, president of bank consulting firm isd/shaw inc., referring to the savings and loan authority. "that's always been the stumbling block and if you take it away, people will get mad and congress doesn't deal with that very well.". on wednesday, treasury secretary robert rubin outlined the clinton administration's bank plan, but sidestepped the controversial banking and commerce question. instead, he offered congress two alternatives one that would allow such combinations and another that would not..
