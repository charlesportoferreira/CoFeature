foreign companies are finally beginning to realise the dream of the china market that has long tantalized traders selling goods to the world's largest slice of mankind and making money from it.. many foreign companies remain stuck in china ventures that are money losing and frustrating, but the number turning a profit or at least gaining solid market share is increasing, along with the market, according to analysts and businessmen.. in the or so years since china opened its doors to the global economy, the country has become the second biggest recipient of foreign investment funds in the world, after the united states.. foreign brands such as coca cola, kentucky fried chicken and lux soap have become household names throughout china, and the shelves of convenience stores from harbin to hainan are stuffed with foreign brand soaps, chocolates and cigarettes.. "overall, more and more companies are coming, which is not necessarily to say they're making money yet," said a western diplomat in shanghai. "but there's now a general view that there's not only great potential but also an increasingly good track record for companies that have persisted.". "you can now see that if you stick it out, you can make money and you can get good market share. coca cola is now a household name throughout china," he added.. coca cola co. came back to china after a year absence in , and the company booked its first accounting profit for its china operations years later, said john farrell, head of china operations.. "you cannot afford not to be in china. it's just the reality of opening a country of this size and the size of the economy and population," farrell said.. "but it takes a lot of patience and you need to be very diligent to build your business. it's not easy by any means.". the atlanta based company has bottling plants across china, and with sales volume doubling every three years this is just the beginning.. coca cola declines to say just how profitable the china market is. like most other companies, it does not issue figures on its china operations.. "you have to march along with the constraints that you're given," farrell said.. "the main thing for us was living up to the commitments we'd made on building plants, transferring technology and training people. the more we did that, the longer we did that, the more people would believe and trust us and allow us to expand a little bit more.". among the sectors that have done well so far are communications equipment firms, such as motorola inc. of schaumberg, ill., and sweden's lm ericsson ab, and low priced consumer product makers.. "generally speaking, the easiest place to make a profit tends to be in the consumer industry, usually fairly small scale operations," said anne stevenson yang, director of china operations for the u.s. china business council.. "that is, assuming the deal is done right," she added.. there are big variations on market access and ease of business for foreign companies depending on the sector they are trying to storm.. the restraints are few in areas such as consumer products, while in sectors such as banking, distribution and insurance, foreign firms are kept on a very tight leash.. overall, companies involved in high cost, long term projects seem to bear a proportionately bigger risk, analysts said.. "big, heavy industry projects are a problem," said one foreign broker in shanghai.. "generally, foreign businesses in trouble have a bad business plan, or they're doing things which china is not famous for like trying to build airplanes or something.". the automobile industry has seen its share of troubles for foreign companies which have ventured in.. chrysler corp. had a famously difficult relationship when it set up a joint venture in beijing in the early s, and france's psa peugeot citroen is looking at closing one of its two china plants.. "we're having some difficulties all western carmarkers are having difficulties in china," said a peugeot official in early december.. general motors corp., which has been close to completing negotiations for a $ billion automobile factory in shanghai for months, is well behind schedule on its plans and could have trouble ever making a profit in china, according to some analysts.. "it's going to be very difficult for them to make money. but they're coming in because they feel they have no choice," said the western diplomat. "it they don't do the deal, ford will.". hong kong and taiwan businessman have generally done much better in their investments than non chinese, said a representative for a hong kong trading company in shanghai.. "but more people make money than they would admit," he added. "people find ways to shift profits to hong kong or from one company to another to make things look like break even.". making money is not a top priority for many companies in the china market, at least in the initial stages. many are happy to break even or lose money for many years in order to gain market share.. the canadian insurance company manulife financial, for instance, which set up a joint venture last month, said it doesn't expect to see a profit for at least seven years..
