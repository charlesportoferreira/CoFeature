caterpillar inc remains concerned that continued strength of the dollar could pressure its pricing, though the impact was not that great in the first quarter.. "so far... the impact's been very minimal and a large part of that is the fact that we've restructured our business so we know how to manage an overvalued dollar," douglas oberhelman, chief financial officer of the peoria, illinois based heavy equipment maker, said in an interview. . that restructuring includes more overseas production, he said.. but the continued strength in the dollar, which is at a multi year high against the yen, could lead to pricing competition from japanese competitors later this year, oberhelman said.. "no question that if the dollar continues to be overvalued and continues to be strong, we'll see some price erosion later in the year," oberhelman said. . "so far, it's not been the predatory pricing that we've seen in the past from our competitors," he said.. earlier tuesday, caterpillar said it expected profits to rise from on "moderately higher" sales.. that forecast anticipates additional tightening by the federal reserve this year.. "we're expecting another basis points probably this year before we finish," oberhelman said. "that's in our plan. anything over and above that, we'd be concerned about.". caterpillar reported net income of $ million, or $. a share for the first quarter, up from $ million, or $. a share a year ago. earnings were well above the $. a share first call mean analyst estimate.. caterpillar shares were up / at / tuesday..
