australia's trust bank has begun looking for a strategic equity partner, inviting offers for a percent stake and announcing plans to put the small, year old bank on the map.. but australian banks need not apply, nor any foreigners which do not share trust bank's ambition to expand beyond the shores of australia's small island state of tasmania, managing director paul kemp told reuters.. "we will be very keen to sort out anybody who thinks they can come in and make a quick killing," kemp said. . "they won't really get to first base with us.". kemp was responding to media speculation that prospective partners would be interested in acquiring the stake to enable it to issue credit cards in australia.. "we would have a broader vision than just that for the franchise. it (a partner) would really need to be an organisation with a broad vision of the expansion of financial services, not just confined to credit cards," he said.. trust bank, which has assets of about a$. billion and is the dominant home lender in tasmania, has just four branches elsewhere in australia. but the bank has national ambitions..
