"it's time we stood up for what our industry is doing right out there," said peterson. "so, to our friends in the media, i say take a tip from one of your own, miss manners, and park that old stereotype of fast talking salesmen in plaid coats and white bucks.". according to peterson, miss manners, whose real name is judith martin, wrote a column in after she shopped for a new car in which she said she was "astonished" at the "dignified courtesy" she found at a dozen dealerships she visted.. peterson spoke at the opening day of the nada's th annual convention and equipment exposition.. in his remarks, peterson acknowledged the traditional dealer franchise system is facing numerous challenges from the explosive growth of used car superstores such as carmax and autonation usa.. but he said traditional franchised dealers will remain the dominant system for selling new cars and trucks. in a year when the superstores grew rapidly, peterson said franchised dealers boosted sales by three percent, increased profits by percent, and finished the year with , dealerships in operation.. of the approximately million new light vehicles expected to be sold in , . million will be sold by the current franchise system.. peterson also took issue with critics who say car dealers do not respond to customers, saying a recent survey by the newspaper association of america indicated that more than percent of new vehicle buyers are satisified or very satisfied..

"large retail chains or automobile department stores are not the answer to the challenges we face. the current franchise system will not only survive, it will flourish," he said.. at a news conference afterward, gieszel said he does not believe the large superstore chains can reap enough economies of scale that they can outperform local franchises. gieszel also said toyota is not convinced the large superstores can offer the close customer attention that individual dealers can..
