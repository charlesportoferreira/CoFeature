russia's norilsk nickel metals group said on thursday that it wanted to be a competitive company and not a financial wet nurse to the arctic, in a strong challenge to the costly soviet legacy of firms supporting towns.. rao norilsky nickel spokesman sergei vetchinin said the burden of supporting the northern town where norilsk's main plant is based was sucking the company dry of resources needed to emerge from financial crisis and boost production.. "capitalists don't support cities," he said. "the city was created for the company. now some of the town is not related to us. but the company still supports the whole town.". it will be difficult for norilsk, a key producer of nickel and precious metals based miles north of the arctic circle, to shatter one of the soviet union's most enduring and costly legacies that of production no matter what the costs.. production costs are precisely what matter now that norilsk, one of the world's biggest nickel, platinum and palladium.
