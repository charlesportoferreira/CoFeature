itt corp. met with financial advisers on thursday to assess an unsolicited $. billion bid from hilton hotels corp., while some wall street analysts said the company's best defense might be to pursue an acquisition.. industry experts said itt might be able to stave off the takeover if it made a large casino or hotel purchase.. "itt is a company with a lot of friends on wall street and a lot of investment bankers and there are a lot of players in the gaming industry who would like to trade up to a higher quality," said thomas ryan of bankers trust.. although itt is widely expected to reject the offer, sources close to the company said no decision had been made and no acquisition talks were being held. itt's board will consider the bid at a regularly scheduled board meeting next tuesday.. itt declined to comment.. on monday, hilton offered to buy itt in a stock and cash transaction that values the company at $ per share. the offer also includes the assumption of $ billion in debt.. the stock of new york based itt, which soared most of the week on views hilton would be forced to raise the bid, fell cents to $... on friday, itt's financial advisers are expected to pore over hilton's official bid documents that are to be filed with the securities and exchange commission.. an acquisition "certainly would be in keeping with the company's history.
