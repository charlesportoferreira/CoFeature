western resources inc, which has spent much of laying the groundwork to buy adt ltd, is widely expected to sweeten its unsolicited $. billion offer for the electronic security giant.. industry experts said the bid, which values adt at / per share, is deliberately low and merely reflects an opening salvo in a hostile transaction.. "the price is a low ball price. there is a very good chance this deal will be done at a higher price," said andrew jeffrey, analyst at robertson stephens &amp; co.. long considered one of the premier properties in the highly fragmented electronic security industry, most industry analysts value adt at significantly more than the western resources offer announced earlier wednesday.. "i feel this stock will go to to on earnings in . anything below that range is not acceptable," said rosario ilacqua of rothschild inc.. furthermore, adt's proposed acquisition by republic industries inc, which collapsed in september, valued the company at about per share. that deal fell apart due uncertainty from republic's volatile stock price.. shares of adt jumped / to / on wednesday.. in a telephone interview, western president dave wittig declined to discuss a potential higher bid, noting only that shares of adt have appreciated considerably in recent months..

"they've got a lot on their plate, but as far as wanting to run the electronic security business, this is the way to do it," jeffrey said.. the electronic security business has grown increasingly attractive to utilities and telecommunications companies in recent months as they prepare to enter new markets that previously were off limits due to government regulation. the phone companies and utilities hope to add protection to their menu of services and expand their presence in homes and businesses..
