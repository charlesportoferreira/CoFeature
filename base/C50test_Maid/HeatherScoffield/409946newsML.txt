inmet mining corp chief executive bill james has one focus for the company he has led for the past six months. antamina.. the huge copper and zinc discovery in peru holds a resource of at least million tonnes of ore, but the deposit requires at least us$. billion to develop. inmet shares the deposit with rio algom ltd.. "we're going to focus on antamina and hopefully that will turn out to be a very profitable mine," james said on friday in an interview.. "our trick is going to be to finance it. we have very limited cash flow right now," he said. "it'll be a difficult situation. but we're going to do it.". how?. "well, at some stage we'll probably do some underwritings and we'll sell off some assets. with the combination of that, we think we can handle our share," james said, springing out of his chair and pacing the room..

"we're not in any rush to sell these things off and we don't want anyone going around these properties kicking tires," he warned.. the company has c$ million in the bank and would not need to fund antamina for two or three more years, he said.. inmet shares were up . to . in toronto, down from a week high of ...
