conagra inc said tuesday its u.s. beef business, which saw a sharp decline in profits in the first half of fiscal , is showing strong signs of recovery in the second half.. "in the second half, the beef business has shown significant improvement," especially compared with weak results a year ago, lee lochmann, president of conagra refrigerated foods cos, said in an interview. conagra was among several food companies presenting at an analysts' conference here. . in the first half of fiscal , conara said its u.s. beef operating earnings were hurt by tighter cattle supplies. looking ahead, lochmann said he expects a good supply of cattle in the united states through the summer and into the fall.. while u.s. cattle supplies are expected to tighten later in calendar , lochmann does not anticipate a severe decline.. "certainly everything we're looking at would indicate it's not going to be as severe a correction as previous cattle cycles," he said. . but an outlook for a tighter u.s. beef market opens some opportunities for conagra's australian beef business, where operating margins have improved considerably, lochmann said.. "as american beef markets begin to firm up more, and they will because of supply, australia is going to be in very good shape for us," lochmann said. "it's a natural hedge for us. they (australian beef operations) become much more competitive from an export standpoint.". conagra already exports about percent of the beef it processes in australia to japan, korea, canada, mexico and, potentially, the united states.. currently, beef exports to the united states from australia are not significant because of low cattle prices in the united states, which makes it difficult to compete.. "but that is going to change," lochmann said.. ((chicago newsdesk )).
