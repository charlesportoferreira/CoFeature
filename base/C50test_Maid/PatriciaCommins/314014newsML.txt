"it's no secret that the retail industry is 'over stored,'" pamela rucker, a spokeswoman for the national retail federation, said. "consolidations are taking place ... those retailers and those retail establishments that aren't performing are the ones that are going to close.". mervyn's stores in florida and georgia are modestly profitable, but their operating margins were below the chain average, dayton hudson spokeswoman susan eich said..

"i'm sure florida and georgia are the areas where they're missing plan the most," merrill lynch analyst daniel barry said.. piper jaffray analyst saul yaari said he has been looking for dayton hudson to shed all of its mervyn's division, focusing the company more on its target division.. "we're looking for a total disposition of mervyn's over the next few years," he said.. however, dayton chairman robert ulrich said in a statement that all three retail divisions target, mervyn's and department stores are core to the company's overall corporate strategy..
