"the cereal aisle is one of the most competitive aisles in the grocery store. as a result, to remain on the shelves, products have to meet increasingly high expectations," said joseph rutledge, a spokesman for general mills inc, the second largest u.s. cereal marker. . while cutting slow selling products is a long standing marketing practice, analysts and industry sources said the process has intensified..

"it comes back to the efforts of the manufacturers to roll back the promotional spending, which will provide the impetus for the retailers to exercise category management practices," sbc warburg analyst chris jakubik said.. scanner data, collected at the grocery check out counter, has provided key information on cereal brand sales..
