"people got spooked about the mainframe business," said alex. brown analyst chris mortenson, who noted the company told analysts in a conference call tuesday night mainframe revenues had fallen eight percent in the december quarter. . cowen &amp; co analyst drew brosseau said mainframe sales were a primary reason why he had lowered his revenue estimates for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in march and for its fiscal year. he also tied the stock decline back to ibm.. "anything that affects ibm mainframes positively or negatively is going to have an impact on ca," he said, noting how ibm's mainframe growth is considered a key indicator of the health of the mainframe business overall.. the analyst said he trimmmed his march fourth quarter revenue estimate by $ million to $. billion and reduced fiscal revenues by $ million to $. billion. . but despite mounting mainframe revenue concerns, most analysts left earnings estimates and stock ratings untouched.. "most of that near term transitional challenge is in the stock so we are still recommending it," brosseau said.
