nuclear oscillations and nuclear filament formation accompany single strand annealing repair of a dicentric chromosome in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dicentric chromosomes undergo breakage during mitosis as a result of the attachment of two centromeres on one sister chromatid to opposite spindle poles. studies utilizing a conditional dicentric chromosome iii in saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that dicentric chromosome repair occurs primarily by deletion of one centromere via a rad dependent recombination pathway. we report that dicentric chromosome resolution requires rad, a gene involved in the single strand annealing dna repair pathway. we additionally show that single strand annealing repair of a dicentric chromosome can occur in the absence of rad. rad independent repair requires the adaptation defective cdc ad allele of the yeast polo kinase and the dna damage checkpoint gene rad. dicentric chromosome breakage in cdc ad rad mutant cells is associated with a prolonged mitotic arrest, during which nuclei undergo microtubule dependent oscillations, accompanied by dynamic changes in nuclear morphology. we further demonstrate that the frequency of spontaneous direct repeat recombination is suppressed in yeast cells treated with benomyl, a drug that perturbs microtubules. our findings indicate that microtubule dependent processes facilitate recombination.
