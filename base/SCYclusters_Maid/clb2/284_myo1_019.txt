type ii myosin involved in cytokinesis in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . we have cloned an unique gene encoding the heavy chain of a type ii myosin in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe. the myo+ gene encodes a protein of amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of kda and containing consensus binding motifs for both essential and regulatory light chains. the s. pombe myo+ head domain is % identical to myosin iis from saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens and % identical to drosophila melanogaster structurally, myo+ most closely resembles budding yeast myo, the tails of both myosin iis containing a number of proline residues that are predicted to substantially disrupt the ability of these myosins to form coiled coils. the myo+ gene is located on chromosome iii, . map units from ade+. deletion of approximately % of the coding sequence of myo+ is lethal but myodelta spores can acquire a suppressor mutation that allows them to form viable microcolonies consisting of filaments of branched cells with aberrant septa. overexpression of myo+ results in the inhibition of cytokinesis; cells become elongated and multinucleate and fail to assemble a functional cytokinetic actin ring and are either aseptate or form aberrant septa. these results suggest that a contractile actin myosin based cytokinetic mechanism appeared early in the evolution of eukaryotic cells and further emphasise the utility of fission yeast as a model organism in which to study the molecular and cellular basis of cytokinesis.
