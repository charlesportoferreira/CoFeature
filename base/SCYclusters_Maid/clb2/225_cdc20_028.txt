cell cycle regulated expression, phosphorylation, and degradation of pcdc. a mammalian homolog of cdc/fizzy/slp.. . pcdc is a mammalian protein that shows high homology to the cell cycle proteins cdcp of saccharomyces cerevisiae and the product of the drosophila fizzy (fzy) gene, both of which contain wd repeats and are thought to be required for the metaphase anaphase transition. the fzy mutants exhibit a metaphase arrest phenotype, which is accompanied by stabilization of cyclins a and b, leading to the hypothesis that fzy function is required for cell cycle regulated ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. pcdc expression was initiated at the g/s transition and steady state levels of pcdc were highest at m and lowest in g. inhibition of the s proteasome prevented both mitotic exit and loss of pcdc at the m/g transition, suggesting that pcdc degradation was mediated by the cell cycle regulated proteolytic pathway. immune complexes of pcdc obtained at different cell cycle stages showed a variety of proteins with dramatic differences observed in the pattern of associated proteins during the transition from g to m. immunolocalization of pcdc demonstrated dynamic changes in pcdc localization as the cells transit mitosis. pcdc appears to act as a regulatory protein interacting with several other proteins, perhaps via its seven wd repeats, at multiple points in the cell cycle.
