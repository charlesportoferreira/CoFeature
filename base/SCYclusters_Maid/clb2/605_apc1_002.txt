identification of subunits of the anaphase promoting complex of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . entry into anaphase and proteolysis of b type cyclins depend on a complex containing the tetratricopeptide repeat proteins cdcp, cdcp, and cdcp. this particle, called the anaphase promoting complex (apc) or cyclosome, functions as a cell cycle regulated ubiquitin protein ligase. two additional subunits of the budding yeast apc were identified. the largest subunit, encoded by the apc gene, is conserved between fungi and vertebrates and shows similarity to bimep from aspergillus nidulans. a small heat inducible subunit is encoded by the cdc gene. the yeast apc is a s particle that contains at least seven different proteins.
