solution structures of two zinc finger domains from swi obtained using two dimensional h nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. a zinc finger structure with a third strand of beta sheet.. . this paper describes the detailed three dimensional structures of two zinc finger domains from the yeast transcription factor swi, calculated using the results of the n.m.r. experiments described in the accompanying paper. the structure of finger is essentially similar to those previously obtained by others for isolated, synthetic single zinc finger domains in solution, and for the three zinc finger peptide zif in its crystalline complex with dna. the n terminal half of the sequence forms a two stranded, irregular beta sheet containing both of the metal binding cysteine residues, while the remainder of the structure forms a helix. approximately the first half of this helix is alpha helical, whereas the c terminal portion, including the two metal binding histidine residues, is () helical. four invariant hydrophobic residues form a core to the structure. in contrast to all previously described structures of zinc finger domains, finger has an additional strand in the beta sheet, formed by residues n terminal to the formal start of the finger motif. this additional strand plays a role in stabilising the folded form of finger , since a two finger peptide lacking the n terminal residues showed folded structure in finger but not in finger .
