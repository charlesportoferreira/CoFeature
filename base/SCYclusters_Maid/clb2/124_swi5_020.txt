cyclin dependent kinase site regulated signal dependent nuclear localization of the sw yeast transcription factor in mammalian cells.. . control over the nuclear transport of transcription factors (tfs) represents a level of gene regulation integral to cellular processes such as differentiation, transformation and signal transduction. the saccharomyces cerevisiae tf swi is excluded from the nucleus in a cell cycle dependent fashion, mediated by phosphorylation by the cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) cdc. nuclear entry occurs in g. beta galactosidase fusion proteins carrying swi amino acids , including the nuclear localization sequence (nls. lys lys tyr glu asn val val ile lys arg ser pro arg lys arg gly arg pro arg lys) were analyzed for subcellular localization in appropriate temperature sensitive yeast strains blocked in g or g/m using indirect immunofluorescence, and for nuclear import kinetics in living rat hepatoma or vero african green monkey kidney cells microinjected with fluorescently labeled bacterially expressed protein and quantitative confocal laser microscopy. cell cycle dependent nuclear localization in yeast was both nls and cdk site dependent, whereby mutation of the cdk site serines (ser and ser) to alanine resulted in constitutive nuclear localization. in mammalian cells, the swi fusion proteins were similarly transported to the nucleus in an nls dependent fashion, while the mutation to ala of the cdk site serines increased the maximal level of nuclear accumulation from about to over fold. we suggest that phosphorylation at the cdk sites inhibits nuclear transport of swi, consistent with our previous observations for the inhibition of sv large tumor antigen nuclear transport by phosphorylation by the cdk cdc. the results indicate for the first time that a yeast nls and, fascinatingly, its regulatory mechanisms are functional in higher eukaryotes, implying the universal nature of regulatory signals for protein transport to the nucleus.
