a change in sister chromatid behavior precedes nuclear division in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we used a genetic assay to monitor the behavior of sister chromatids during the cell cycle. we show that the ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges (sce) with ionizing radiation is maximal in budded cells with undivided nuclei and then decreases prior to nuclear division. sce can be induced in cells arrested in g using either nocodazole or cdc mutants. these data show that sister chromatids have two different states prior to nuclear division. we suggest that the sister chromatids of cir. iii, a circular derivative of chromosome iii, separate (anaphase a) prior to spindle elongation (anaphase b). other interpretations are also discussed. sce can be induced in cdc mutants that arrest in g and in nocodazole treated cells, suggesting that mitotic checkpoints arrest cells prior to sister chromatid separation.
