teap is a kinesin like protein required to generate polarized growth in fission yeast.. . cytoplasmic microtubules are critical for establishing and maintaining cell shape and polarity. our investigations of kinesin like proteins (klps) and morphological mutants in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified a kinesin like gene, tea(+), that is required for cells to generate proper polarized growth. cells deleted for this gene are often bent during exponential growth and initiate growth from improper sites as they exit stationary phase. they have a reduced cytoplasmic microtubule network and display severe morphological defects in genetic backgrounds that produce long cells. the tip specific marker, teap, is mislocalized in both tea and teadelta cells, indicating that teap function is necessary for proper localization of teap. teap is localized to the tips of the cell and in a punctate pattern within the cell, often coincident with the ends of cytoplasmic microtubules. these results suggest that this kinesin promotes microtubule growth, possibly through interactions with the microtubule end, and that it is important for establishing and maintaining polarized growth along the long axis of the cell.
