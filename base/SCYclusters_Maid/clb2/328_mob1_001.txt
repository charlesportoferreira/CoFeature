the s. pombe orthologue of the s. cerevisiae mob gene is essential and functions in signalling the onset of septum formation.. . we have isolated the schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologue of the saccharomyces cerevisiae mob gene in a screen designed to enrich for septation mutants. the gene is essential, and cells lacking it display a phenotype typical of septation signalling network mutants. mobp is located on both spindle pole bodies throughout mitosis. in addition it is also co localised with the medial ring later in mitosis, and flanks the septum as the medial ring contracts. we also demonstrate that mobp can be precipitated from cells in a complex with the septation regulating kinase sidp.
