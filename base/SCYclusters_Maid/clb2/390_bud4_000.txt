midp stabilizes septin rings during cytokinesis in fission yeast.. . septins are filament forming proteins with a conserved role in cytokinesis. in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, septin rings appear to be involved primarily in cell cell separation, a late stage in cytokinesis. here, we identified a protein midp on the basis of its sequence similarity to s. pombe midp, saccharomyces cerevisiae budp, and candida albicans intp. like septin mutants, middelta mutants had delays in cell cell separation. middelta mutants were defective in septin organization but not contractile ring closure or septum formation. in wild type cells, septins assembled first during mitosis in a single ring and during septation developed into double rings that did not contract. in middelta cells, septins initially assembled in a single ring but during septation appeared in the cleavage furrow, forming a washer or disc structure. frap studies showed that septins are stable in wild type cells but exchange fold more rapidly in middelta cells. midp colocalized with septins and required septins for its localization. a cooh terminal pleckstrin homology domain of midp was required for its localization and function. no genetic interactions were found between mid and the related gene mid. thus, these studies identify a new factor responsible for the proper stability and function of septins during cytokinesis.
