nuclear migration in saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by the highly repetitive kda num protein.. . we have isolated a novel gene (num) with unusual internal periodicity. the num gene encodes a kda protein with a potential ca+ binding site and a central domain containing almost identical tandem repeats of a amino acid polypeptide. num disrupted strains grow normally, but contain many budded cells with two nuclei in the mother cell instead of a single nucleus at the bud neck, while all unbudded cells are uninucleate. this indicates that most g nuclei divide in the mother before migrating to the neck, followed by the migration of one of the two daughter nuclei into the bud. furthermore, haploid num strains tend to diploidize during mitosis, and homozygous num diploid or tetraploid cells sporulate to form many budded asci with up to eight haploid or diploid spores, respectively, indicating that meiosis starts before nuclear redistribution and cytokinesis. our data suggest that the num protein is involved in the interaction of the g nucleus with the bud neck.
