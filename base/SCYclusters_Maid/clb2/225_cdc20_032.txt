a novel mammalian protein, pcdc, present in dividing cells is associated with protein kinase activity and has homology to the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell division cycle proteins cdc and cdc.. . a novel protein, pcdc, has been identified in cycling mammalian cells. this transcript is readily detectable in all exponentially growing cell lines but disappears when cells are chemically induced to fall out of the cell cycle and differentiate. the pcdc protein appears to be essential for cell division, since transfection of antisense pcdc cdna into cho cells resulted in isolation of only those cells which exhibited a compensatory increase in pcdc transcripts in the sense orientation. immunoprecipitation of pcdc yielded protein complexes with kinase activity which fluctuated during the cell cycle. since pcdc does not have the conserved protein kinase domains, this activity must be due to one or more of the associated proteins in the immune complex. the highest levels of protein kinase activity were seen with alpha casein and myelin basic protein as substrates and demonstrated a pattern of activity distinct from that described for the known cyclin dependent cell division kinases. the pcdc protein was also phosphorylated in dividing cells. the amino acid sequence of pcdc contains seven repeats homologous to the beta subunit of g proteins, and the highest degree of homology in these repeats was found with the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc and cdc proteins, which have been proposed to be involved in the formation of a functional bipolar mitotic spindle in yeast cells. the g beta repeat has been postulated to mediate protein protein interactions and, in pcdc, may modulate its association with a unique cell cycle protein kinase. these findings suggest that pcdc is a component of the mammalian cell cycle mechanism.
