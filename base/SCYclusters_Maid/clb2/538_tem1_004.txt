a novel functional domain of cdc kinase is required for its interaction with tem gtpase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . exit from mitosis requires the inactivation of cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) activity. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, a number of gene products have been identified as components of the signal transduction network regulating inactivation of cdk (called the men, for the mitotic exit network). cdc, one of such components of the men, is an essential protein kinase. by the two hybrid screening, we identified cdc as a binding protein of tem gtpase, another essential regulator of the men. coprecipitation experiments revealed that tem binds to cdc in vivo. by deletion analysis, we found that the tem binding domain resides near the conserved kinase domain of cdc. the cdc lf mutation, which was introduced into the tem binding domain, reduced the interaction with cdc and tem and caused temperature sensitive growth.the kinase activity of cdc was not so much affected by the cdc lf mutation. however, cdc lf failed to localize to the spb at the restrictive temperature. our data show that the interaction with tem is important for the function of cdc and that cdc and tem function in a complex to direct the exit from mitosis.
