a fission yeast homolog of cdc/pcdc/fizzy is required for recovery from dna damage and genetically interacts with pcdc.. . successful recovery from dna damage requires coordination of several biological processes. eukaryotic cell cycle progression is delayed when the cells encounter dna damaging agents. this cell cycle delay allows the cells to cope with dna damage by utilizing dna repair enzymes. thus, at least two processes, induction of the cell cycle delay and repair of damaged dna, are coordinately required for recovery. in this study, a fission yeast rad mutant (slp ) was genetically investigated. in response to radiation, slp stops cell division; however, it does not restart it. this defect is suppressed when slp is combined with wee or cdc w; in these mutants, the onset of mitosis is advanced due to the premature activation of pcdc. in contrast, slp is synthetically lethal with cdc, nim/cdr, or cdr, all of which are unable to activate the pcdc kinase correctly. these genetic interactions of slp with cdc and its modulators imply that slp is not defective in either &quot;induction of cell cycle delay&quot; or &quot;dna repair.&quot; slp+ may be involved in a critical process which restarts cell cycle progression after the completion of dna repair. molecular cloning of slp+ revealed that slp+ encodes a putative amino acid polypeptide exhibiting significant homology to wd domain proteins, namely, cdc (budding yeast), pcdc (human), and fizzy (fly). a possible role of slp+ is proposed.
