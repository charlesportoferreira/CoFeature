cdc activates exit from mitosis in budding yeast.. . the activity of the cyclin dependent kinase (cdk), cdc, inhibits the transition from anaphase to g in budding yeast. cdc tv, yf (cdc vf), a mutant that lacks inhibitory phosphorylation sites, delays the exit from mitosis and is hypersensitive to perturbations that arrest cells in mitosis. surprisingly, this behavior is not due to a lack of inhibitory phosphorylation or increased kinase activity, but reflects reduced activity of the anaphase promoting complex (apc), a defect shared with other mutants that lower cdc/clb activity in mitosis. cdc vf has reduced cdc dependent apc activity in mitosis, but normal hct dependent apc activity in the g phase of the cell cycle. the defect in cdc dependent apc activity in cdc vf correlates with reduced association of cdc with the apc. the defects of cdc vf suggest that cdc activity is required to induce the metaphase to anaphase transition and initiate the transition from anaphase to g in budding yeast.
