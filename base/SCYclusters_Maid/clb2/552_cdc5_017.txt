a novel role for cdcp in dna replication.. . dna replication initiates from specific chromosomal sites called origins, and in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae these sites are occupied by the origin recognition complex (orc). dbfp is proposed to play a role in targeting the g/s kinase cdcp to initiation complexes late in g. we report that dbfp may also recruit cdcp to origin complexes. cdcp is a member of the polo family of kinases that is required for the completion of mitosis. cdcp and cdcp each interact with a distinct domain of dbfp. cdc mutants have a plasmid maintenance defect that can be suppressed by the addition of multiple origins. cdc orc double mutants are synthetically lethal. levels of cdcp were found to be cell cycle regulated and peaked in g/m. these results suggest a role for cdcp and possibly polo like kinases at origin complexes.
