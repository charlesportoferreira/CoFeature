the identification of transposon tagged mutations in essential genes that affect cell morphology in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae reproduces by budding, and many genes are required for proper bud development. mutations in some of these genes cause cells to die with an unusual terminal morphology elongated or otherwise aberrantly shaped buds. to gain insight into bud development, we set out to identify novel genes that encode proteins required for proper bud morphogenesis. previous studies screened collections of conditional mutations to identify genes required for essential functions, including bud formation. however, genes that are not susceptible to the generation of mutations that cause a conditional phenotype will not be identified in such screens. to identify a more comprehensive collection of mutants, we used transposon mutagenesis to generate a large collection of lethal disruption mutations. this collection was used to identify mutants with disruptions that cause an aberrant terminal bud morphology. the disruption mutations in of these mutants identify three previously uncharacterized genes as essential, and the mutant phenotypes suggest roles for their products in bud morphogenesis.
