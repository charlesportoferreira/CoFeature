the yeast cdc and cdc genes restrict dna replication to once per cell cycle.. . cdc and cdc were identified as genes in s. cerevisiae necessary to limit dna replication to once per cell cycle. a screen for mutants that overreplicated their dna uncovered new conditional alleles that cause accumulation of up to c dna. dna overreplication involves all chromosomes and does not require passage through mitosis or another start. it occurs within a single cell cycle and can cause arrest at the mec checkpoint. remarkably, clb cdc activity remains elevated in the overreplicating cells. these observations distinguish cdc and cdc from other mutants that accumulate extra dna after completing an aberrent mitosis, or skipping mitosis altogether, and entering a second, inappropriate g and s phase. cdc and cdc may contribute to replication control by targeted proteolysis of an s phase initiator.
