the yeast tem gene, which encodes a gtp binding protein, is involved in termination of m phase.. . lte belongs to the cdc family that encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for gtp binding proteins of the ras family. previously we have shown that lte is essential for termination of m phase at low temperatures. we have identified tem as a gene that, when present on a multicopy plasmid, suppresses the cold sensitive phenotype of lte. sequence analysis of tem and gtp binding analysis of the gene product revealed that tem encodes a novel low molecular weight gtp binding protein. the defect of tem was lethal, and the tem defective cells were arrested at telophase with high h kinase activity under restrictive conditions, indicating that tem is required to exit from m phase. the defect of tem was suppressed by a high dose of cdc, which encodes a protein kinase homologous to mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinases. the genetic interaction among lte, tem, and cdc indicates that they cooperatively play an essential role for termination of m phase.
