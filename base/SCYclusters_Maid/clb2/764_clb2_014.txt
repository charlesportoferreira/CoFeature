a novel yeast screen for mitotic arrest mutants identifies doc, a new gene involved in cyclin proteolysis.. . b type cyclins are rapidly degraded at the transition between metaphase and anaphase and their ubiquitin mediated proteolysis is required for cells to exit mitosis. we used a novel enrichment to isolate new budding mutants that arrest the cell cycle in mitosis. most of these mutants lie in the cdc, cdc, and cdc genes, which have already been shown to play a role in cyclin proteolysis and encode components of a s complex (called the cyclosome or anaphase promoting complex) that ubiquitinates mitotic cyclins. we show that mutations in cdc and a novel gene, doc, also prevent mitotic cyclin proteolysis. mutants in either gene arrest as large budded cells with high levels of the major mitotic cyclin (clb) protein at degrees c and cannot degrade clb in g arrested cells. cdc associates in vivo with doc, cdc, cdc, and cdc. in addition, the majority of doc cosediments at s with cdc in a sucrose gradient, indicating that cdc and doc are components of the anaphase promoting complex.
