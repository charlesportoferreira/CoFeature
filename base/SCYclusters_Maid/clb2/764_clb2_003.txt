a novel ring finger protein, human enhancer of invasion , alters mitotic progression through regulation of cyclin b levels.. . the process of cellular morphogenesis is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is dependent upon the function of proteins that are centrally involved in specification of the cell cycle. the human enhancer of invasion clone (hei) protein was identified from a hela cell library based on its ability to promote yeast agar invasion and filamentation. through two hybrid screening, the mitotic cyclin b and an e ubiquitin conjugating enzyme were isolated as hei interacting proteins. mutation of the hei divergent ring finger motif (characteristic of e ubiquitin ligases) and cdc/cyclin binding and phosphorylation sites alter hei dependent yeast phenotypes, including delay in g()/m transition. in vertebrates, the addition of hei inhibits nuclear envelope breakdown and mitotic entry in xenopus egg extracts. mechanistically, hei expression reduces cyclin b levels in cycling xenopus eggs and reduces levels of the cyclin b ortholog clbp in yeast. hei is itself a specific in vitro substrate of purified cyclin b/cdc, with a tpvr motif as primary phosphorylation site. finally, hei is itself ubiquitinated in egg extracts and is also autoubiquitinated in vitro. these and other points lead to a model in which hei defines a divergent class of e ubiquitin ligase, functioning in progression through g()/m.
