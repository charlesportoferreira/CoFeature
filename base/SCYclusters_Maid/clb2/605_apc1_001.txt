mass spectrometric analysis of the anaphase promoting complex from yeast. identification of a subunit related to cullins.. . entry into anaphase and exit from mitosis depend on a ubiquitin protein ligase complex called the anaphase promoting complex (apc) or cyclosome. at least different subunits were detected in the purified particle from budding yeast, including the previously identified proteins apcp, cdcp, cdcp, cdcp, and cdcp. five additional subunits purified in low nanogram amounts were identified by tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. apcp, apcp, and the ring finger protein apcp are conserved from yeast to humans. apcp is similar to the cullin cdcp, which is a subunit of the ubiquitin protein ligase complex scfcdc required for the initiation of dna replication.
