cell cycle regulated transcription of the clb gene is dependent on mcm and a ternary complex factor.. . clb is the major b type mitotic cyclin required for entry into mitosis in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. we showed that accumulation of clb transcripts in g cells is controlled at the transcriptional level and identified a bp upstream activating sequence (uas) containing an mcm binding site as being necessary and sufficient for cell cycle regulation. sequences within the cell cycle regulated uas were shown to bind mcm in vitro, and mutation which abolished mcm dependent dna binding activity eliminated cell cycle regulated transcription in vivo. a second protein with no autonomous dna binding activity was also recruited into mcm uas complexes, generating a ternary complex. a point mutation in the clb uas which blocked ternary complex formation, but still allowed mcm to bind, resulted in loss of cell cycle regulation in vivo, suggesting that the ternary complex factor is also important in control of clb transcription. we discuss the possibility that the clb gene is coregulated with other genes known to be regulated with the same periodicity and suggest that mcm and the ternary complex factor may coordinately regulate several other g regulated transcripts.
