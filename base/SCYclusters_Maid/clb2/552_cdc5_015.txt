human prk is a conserved protein serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating m phase functions.. . human prk encodes a novel protein serine/threonine kinase capable of strongly phosphorylating casein but not histone h in vitro. prk expression is tightly regulated at various levels during different stages of the cell cycle in lung fibroblasts. the prk kinase activity is relatively low during mitosis, g, and g/s, and peaks during late s and g stages of the cell cycle. recombinant human prk expressed through the baculoviral vector system is capable of phosphorylating cdcc, a positive regulator for the g/m transition. human prk shares significant sequence homology with saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc and drosophila melanogaster polo, both of which are essential for mitosis and meiosis. full length prk transcripts greatly potentiate progesterone induced meiotic maturation of xenopus laevis oocytes. on the other hand, antisense prk transcripts significantly delay and reduce the rate of oocyte maturation. when expressed in a cdc mutant strain of s. cerevisiae, human prk, but not a deletional mutant protein, fully rescues the temperature sensitive phenotype of the budding yeast. taken together, prk may represent a new protein kinase, playing an important role in regulating the onset and/or progression of mitosis in mammalian cells.
