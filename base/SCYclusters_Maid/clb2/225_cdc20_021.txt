mammalian pcdc mediates association of the spindle checkpoint protein mad with the cyclosome/anaphase promoting complex, and is involved in regulating anaphase onset and late mitotic events.. . we have investigated the function of pcdc, a mammalian protein related to cdc and hct/cdh in saccharomyces cerevisiae, and fizzy and fizzy related in drosophila. immunofluorescence studies and expression of a pcdc gfp chimera demonstrate that pcdc is concentrated at the kinetochores in m phase cells from late prophase to telophase. some pcdc is also associated with the spindle microtubules and spindle poles, and some is diffuse in the cytoplasm. at anaphase, the concentration of pcdc at the kinetochores gradually diminishes, and is gone by late telophase. in extracts prepared from m phase, but not from interphase hela cells, pcdc coimmunoprecipitates with three important elements of the m phase checkpoint machinery. cdc, cdc, and mad. pcdc is required for binding mad with the cdc and cdc. thus, it is likely that pcdc mediates the association of mad with the cyclosome/anaphase promoting complex. microinjection of anti pcdc antibody into mitotic mammalian cells induces arrest or delay at metaphase, and impairs progression of late mitotic events. these studies suggest that mammalian pcdc may be part of a regulatory and targeting complex for the anaphase promoting complex.
