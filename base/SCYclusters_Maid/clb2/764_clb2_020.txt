genes involved in sister chromatid separation are needed for b type cyclin proteolysis in budding yeast.. . b type cyclin destruction is necessary for exit from mitosis and the initiation of a new cell cycle. through the isolation of mutants, we have identified three essential yeast genes, cdc, cdc, and cse, which are required for proteolysis of the b type cyclin clb but not of other unstable proteins. cdc mutants are defective in both entering and exiting anaphase. their failure to exit anaphase can be explained by defective cyclin proteolysis. cdc is required at the metaphase/anaphase transition to separate sister chromatids, and we speculate that it might promote proteolysis of proteins that hold sister chromatids together. proteolysis of clb is initiated in early anaphase, but a fraction of clb remains stable until anaphase is complete.
