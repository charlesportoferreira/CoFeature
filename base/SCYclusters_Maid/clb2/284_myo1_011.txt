srop, a saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart of the tumor suppressor l()gl protein, is related to myosins in function.. . yeast sro was identified as a multicopy suppressor of a defect in rhop, a small gtpase that maintains cell polarity. srop and srop, a homologue of srop, possess domains homologous to the protein that are encoded by the drosophila tumor suppressor gene lethal () giant larvae [l()gl]. srodelta srodelta mutants showed a partial defect of organization of the polarized actin cytoskeleton and a cold sensitive growth phenotype. a human counterpart of l()gl could suppress the srodelta srodelta defect. similar to the l()gl protein, srop formed a complex with myop, a type ii myosin. these results indicate that srop and srop are the yeast counterparts of the l()gl protein. our genetic analysis revealed that deletion of sro and sro showed reciprocal suppression with deletion of myo (i.e., the srodelta srodelta defect was suppressed by myodelta and vice versa). in addition, sro showed genetic interactions with myo, encoding an essential type v myosin. overexpression of sro suppressed a defect in myo and, conversely, overexpression of myo suppressed the cold sensitive phenotype of srodelta srodelta mutants. these results indicate that sro function is closely related to both myop and myop. we propose a model in which sro function is involved in the targeting of the myosin proteins to their intrinsic pathways.
