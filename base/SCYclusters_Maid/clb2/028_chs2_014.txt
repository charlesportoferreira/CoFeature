isolation of canchsa, a variant gene of candida albicans chitin synthase.. . a canchsa gene encoding the chitin synthase of candida albicans was cloned. dna sequencing and comparison with another canchs gene described elsewhere indicated that the canchsa gene encoded a polypeptide with amino acid residues, a protein with one less amino acid than that encoded by the canchs gene. a six base alteration was observed between the two genes, suggesting that the canchsa gene is a variant gene of the canchs. the ph profile/activity relationship of canchsa in permeabilized cells was identical to that of canchs. the canchsa enzyme was competitively inhibited by polyoxin d (. microm) and nikkomycin z ( microm). when the cloned gene was expressed in a saccharomyces cerevisiae chs mutant that exhibited aberrant morphology, the normal structure was restored. we conclude that the function of the canchsa gene is similar to that of sacchs in s. cerevisiae.
