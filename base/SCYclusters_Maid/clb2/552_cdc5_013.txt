cdc and ckii control adaptation to the yeast dna damage checkpoint.. . a single double stranded dna (dsdna) break will cause yeast cells to arrest in g/m at the dna damage checkpoint. if the dsdna break cannot be repaired, cells will eventually override (that is, adapt to) this checkpoint, even though the damage that elicited the arrest is still present. here, we report the identification of two adaptation defective mutants that remain permanently arrested as large budded cells when faced with an irreparable dsdna break in a nonessential chromosome. this adaptation defective phenotype was entirely relieved by deletion of rad, a gene required for the g/m dna damage checkpoint arrest. we show that one mutation resides in cdc, which encodes a polo like kinase, whereas a second, less penetrant, adaptation defective mutant is affected at the ckb locus, which encodes a nonessential specificity subunit of casein kinase ii.
