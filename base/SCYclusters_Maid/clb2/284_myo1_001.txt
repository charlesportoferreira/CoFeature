septins, under clap regulation, and the chitin ring are required for neck integrity in budding yeast.. . cla, encoding a protein kinase of the pak type, and cdc, encoding a septin, were isolated in a screen for synthetic lethality with chs, which encodes the chitin synthase iii catalytic moiety. although step shares some essential function with clap, it did not show synthetic lethality with chsp. cla and cdc mutants exhibited similar morphological and septin localization defects, including aberrant and ectopic septa. myop, which requires septins for localization, formed abnormally wide rings in cla mutants. in cultures started with unbudded cells, an inhibitor of chsp activity, nikkomycin z, aggravated the abnormalities of cla and cdc mutants and gave rise to enlarged necks at the mother bud junction, leading to cell death. it is concluded that clap is required for the correct localization and/or assembly of the septin ring and that both the septin ring and the chsp requiring chitin ring at the mother bud neck cooperate in maintaining the neck constricted throughout the cell cycle, a vital function in budding yeast.
