mnd and swm are core subunits of the saccharomyces cerevisiae anaphase promoting complex.. . the anaphase promoting complex (apc) is a multisubunit e ubiquitin ligase that regulates the metaphase anaphase transition and exit from mitosis in eukaryotic cells. eleven subunits have been previously identified in apc from budding yeast. we have identified two additional subunits, mnd and swm, by mass spectrometry. both mnd and swm were found specifically associated with a highly purified preparation of apc from haploid yeast whole cell extract. moreover, the apc co purified with epitope tagged mnd and swm. both proteins were present in apc preparations from haploid cells arrested in g(), s, and m phases and from meiotic diploid cells, indicating that they are constitutive components of the complex throughout the yeast cell cycle. mnd interacted strongly with cdc, apc, and apc when coexpressed in an in vitro transcription/translation reaction. swm also interacted with cdc and apc in this system. previous studies described meiotic defects for mutations in mnd and swm. here, we show that mnddelta and swmdelta haploid strains exhibit slow growth and accumulation of g()/m cells comparable with that seen in apcdelta or apcdelta strains and consistent with an apc defect. taken together, these results demonstrate that swm and mnd are functional components of the yeast apc.
