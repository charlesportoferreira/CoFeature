cell cycle regulation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae polo like kinase cdcp.. . progression through and completion of mitosis require the actions of the evolutionarily conserved polo kinase. we have determined that the levels of cdcp, a saccharomyces cerevisiae member of the polo family of mitotic kinases, are cell cycle regulated. cdcp accumulates in the nuclei of g/m phase cells, and its levels decline dramatically as cells progress through anaphase and begin telophase. we report that cdcp levels are sensitive to mutations in key components of the anaphase promoting complex (apc). we have determined that cdcp associated kinase activity is restricted to g/m and that this activity is posttranslationally regulated. these results further link the actions of the apc to the completion of mitosis and suggest possible roles for cdcp during progression through and completion of mitosis.
