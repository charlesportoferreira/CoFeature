direct evidence for a critical role of myosin ii in budding yeast cytokinesis and the evolvability of new cytokinetic mechanisms in the absence of myosin ii.. . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, an actomyosin based contractile ring is present during cytokinesis, as occurs in animal cells. however, the precise requirement for this structure during budding yeast cytokinesis has been controversial. here we show that deletion of myo, the single myosin ii gene, is lethal in a commonly used strain background. the terminal phenotype of myodelta is interconnected chains of cells, suggestive of a cytokinesis defect. to further investigate the role of myop in cytokinesis, we conditionally disrupted myo function by using either a dominant negative myop construct or a strain where expression of myop can be shut off. both ways of disruption of myo function result in a failure in cytokinesis. additionally, we show that a myodelta strain previously reported to grow nearly as well as the wild type contains a single genetic suppressor that alleviates the severe cytokinesis defects of myodelta. using fluorescence time lapse imaging and electron microscopy techniques, we show that cytokinesis in this strain is achieved through formation of multiple aberrant septa. taken together, these results strongly suggest that the actomyosin ring is crucial for successful cytokinesis in budding yeast, but new cytokinetic mechanisms can evolve through genetic changes when myosin ii function is impaired.
