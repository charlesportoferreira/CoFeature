activating phosphorylation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclin dependent kinase, cdcp, precedes cyclin binding.. . eukaryotic cell cycle progression is controlled by a family of protein kinases known as cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). two steps are essential for cdk activation. binding of a cyclin and phosphorylation on a conserved threonine residue by the cdk activating kinase (cak). we have studied the interplay between these regulatory mechanisms during the activation of the major saccharomyces cerevisiae cdk, cdcp. we found that the majority of cdcp was phosphorylated on its activating threonine (thr ) throughout the cell cycle. the extent of thr phosphorylation was similar for monomeric cdcp and cdcp bound to cyclin. by varying the order of the addition of cyclin and cakp, we determined that cdcp was activated most efficiently when it was phosphorylated before cyclin binding. furthermore, we found that a cdcp(ta) mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated, bound cyclin less well than wild type cdcp in vivo. these results suggest that unphosphorylated cdcp may be unable to bind tightly to cyclin. we propose that cdcp is normally phosphorylated by cakp before it binds cyclin. this activation pathway contrasts with that in higher eukaryotes, in which cyclin binding appears to precede activating phosphorylation.
