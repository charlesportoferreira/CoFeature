cdc and ime possess redundant functions in promoting entry into premeiotic dna replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae initiation and progression through the mitotic cell cycle are determined by the sequential activity of the cyclin dependent kinase cdc. the role of this kinase in entry and progression through the meiotic cycle is unclear, since all cdc temperature sensitive alleles are leaky for meiosis. we used a &quot;heat inducible degron system&quot; to construct a diploid strain homozygous for a temperature degradable cdc deg allele. we show that this allele is nonleaky, giving no asci at the nonpermissive temperature. we also show, using this allele, that cdc is not required for premeiotic dna replication and commitment to meiotic recombination. ime encodes a meiosis specific hcdk homolog that is required for the correct timing of premeiotic dna replication, nuclear divisions, and asci formation. moreover, in imedelta diploids additional rounds of dna replication and nuclear divisions are observed. we show that the delayed premeiotic dna replication observed in imedelta diploids depends on a functional cdc. imedelta cdc diploids arrest prior to initiation of premeiotic dna replication and meiotic recombination. ectopic overexpression of clb at early meiotic times advances premeiotic dna replication, meiotic recombination, and nuclear division, but the coupling between these events is lost. the role of ime and cdc in initiating the meiotic pathway is discussed.
