over expression of pcdc inhibits granulocyte differentiation and accelerates apoptosis in myeloid cells.. . pcdc is a protein identified in cycling mammalian cells. it is highly expressed in proliferating but not in differentiated or growth arrested cells. structurally, pcdc is similar to the cdc and cdc proteins, which have been proposed to regulate dna synthesis and mitosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. to define the role of pcdc during myelopoiesis, we studied the expression and regulation of this protein in response to the hematopoietic growth factors, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm csf) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (g csf). we analysed the time course of expression of pcdc in response to gm csf and g csf stimulation in the murine factor dependent myeloid leukemic cell line, dc, and demonstrated differential regulation of pcdc in response to these two growth factors. over expression of pcdc resulted in acceleration of apoptosis in growth factor and serum free conditions, although no difference was observed in the rate of cell proliferation. decreases in pcdc protein levels correlated with cells undergoing apoptosis. pcdc over expression also inhibited granulocyte differentiation of dc cells treated with g csf. our studies suggest that pcdc regulation is critical for normal cell cycle control during myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation.
