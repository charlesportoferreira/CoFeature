identification of myo, a second class v myosin gene in yeast.. . we have isolated a fourth myosin gene (myo) in yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). myo encodes a approximately kda ( amino acid) class v myosin, using the classification devised by cheney et al. (a; cell motil. cytoskel. , ); the motor domain is followed by a neck region containing six putative calmodulin binding sites and a tail with a short potential 'coiled coil' domain. a comparison with other myosins in genbank reveals that myo protein is most closely related to the yeast myo protein, another class v myosin. deletion of myo produces no detectable phenotype, either alone or in conjunction with mutations in myo or other myosin genes, the actin gene, or secretory genes. however, overexpression of myo or myo results in several morphological abnormalities, including the formation of short strings of unseparated cells in diploid strains, or clusters of cells in haploid strains. alterations of myo or myo indicate that neither the motor domains nor tails of these myosins are required to confer the overexpression phenotype, whereas the neck region may be required. although this phenotype is similar to that seen upon myo deletion, we provide evidence that the overexpression of myop or myop is not simply interfering with myop function.
