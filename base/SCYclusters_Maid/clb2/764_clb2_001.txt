saccharomyces cerevisiae atsp interacts with napp, a cytoplasmic protein that controls bud morphogenesis.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae ats (alpha tubulin suppressor ) was originally identified as a high copy suppressor of class two alpha tubulin mutations and was proposed to have a regulatory role in coordinating the microtubule state with the cell cycle. here, we show that atsp interacts with napp, a cytoplasmic protein that regulates the activity of the cdcp/clbp complex. loss of napp results in a delayed switch from polar to isotropic bud growth. the delayed switch results in elongated buds. napp and atsp interact in two hybrid and co immunoprecipitation assays. both napdelta and atsdelta cells have a clbp dependent elongated bud morphology. deletion of ats partially suppresses the elongated bud morphology and benomyl resistance of napdelta mutants. our results suggest atsp might regulate coordination of the microtubule state with the cell cycle through an interaction with napp.
