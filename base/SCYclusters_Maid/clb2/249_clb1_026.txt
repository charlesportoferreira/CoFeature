the role of cdc and other genes in meiosis in schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . the requirement of the cdc, cdc and cdc genes for meiosis in schizosaccharomyces pombe was investigated using three different conditions to induce meiosis. these genes were known to be required for meiosis ii. cdc and cdc are essential for meiosis i. the cdc gene, which is required for the initiation of both mitotic s phase and m phase, is essential for premeiotic dna synthesis and meiosis ii. the requirement of cdc for meiosis i was unclear. this contrasts with saccharomyces cerevisiae, where cdc, the homolog of cdc, is required for meiosis i but not for premeiotic dna synthesis. expression of cdc and cdc was induced after premeiotic dna synthesis, reaching a sharp peak before the first nuclear division. expression of cdc, encoding the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, was also induced but the peak was before premeiotic dna synthesis. the induction of cdc and cdc was largely dependent on dna synthesis and the function of the mei gene. the mei gene itself was also induced in a dna synthesis dependent manner. the chain of gene expression activating cdc may be important as part of the mechanism that ensures the dependency of nuclear division on dna replication during meiosis.
