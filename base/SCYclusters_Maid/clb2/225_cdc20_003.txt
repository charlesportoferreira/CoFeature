doc mediates the activity of the anaphase promoting complex by contributing to substrate recognition.. . the anaphase promoting complex (apc) is a multisubunit e ubiquitin ligase that targets specific cell cycle related proteins for degradation, regulating progression from metaphase to anaphase and exit from mitosis. the apc is regulated by binding of the coactivator proteins cdcp and cdhp, and by phosphorylation. we have developed a purification strategy that allowed us to purify the budding yeast apc to near homogeneity and identify two novel apc associated proteins, swmp and mndp. using an in vitro ubiquitylation system and a native gel binding assay, we have characterized the properties of wild type and mutant apc. we show that both the d and ken boxes contribute to substrate recognition and that coactivator is required for substrate binding. apc lacking apcp or docp/apc have impaired e ligase activities. however, whereas apcp is required for structural stability and the incorporation of cdcp into the apc complex, docp/apc plays a specific role in substrate recognition by apc coactivator complexes. these results imply that docp/apc may play a role to regulate the binding of specific substrates, similar to that of the coactivators.
