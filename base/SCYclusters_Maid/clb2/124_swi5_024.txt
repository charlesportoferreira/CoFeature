a new role for mcm in yeast. cell cycle regulation of sw transcription.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle regulated sw transcription is essential for ensuring that mother and not daughter cells switch mating type. we have identified a bp promoter sequence that appears to be responsible for restricting transcription to the late s, g, and m phases of the cell cycle. two proteins, mcm, a transcription factor described previously, and sff (swi five factor, a newly identified factor) bind this sequence in vitro. mcm binds the dna tightly on its own, but sff will only bind as part of a ternary complex with mcm. we observe a strong correlation between the ability of mutated swi promoter sequences to form a ternary mcm sff containing complex in vitro and to activate transcription in vivo, which suggests that efficient transcription requires that both proteins bind dna. through its interactions with cell type specific coactivators and corepressors, mcm controls cell type specific expression of pheromone and receptor genes. by analogy, we propose that sff enables mcm to function as a part of a cell cycle regulated transcription complex.
