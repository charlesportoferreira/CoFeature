budding yeast cdc phosphorylates net and assists cdc release from the nucleolus.. . polo like kinase cdc and cdc phosphatase are essential for mitotic exit in budding yeast. cdc sequestered in the nucleolus by forming a complex with net, a nucleolar inhibitor of cdc, is activated after the release from the nucleolus and cdc is essential for this release. here we show that cdc affects the phosphorylation state of net. tab is a dominant active form of cdc. we found that tab was released from the nucleolus of cdc mutant cells in a cell cycle dependent manner and that the release of tab (or cdc) was not sufficient for the cdc mutant to grow at a higher temperature. altogether, we propose that cdc acts to reduce affinity between cdc and net and that the timing of cdc release is independent of cdc. we also provide evidence that the critical function of cdc, other than cdc liberation, exists in late mitotic events.
