two distinct myosin light chain structures are induced by specific variations within the bound iq motifs functional implications.. . iq motifs are widespread in nature. mlcp is a calmodulin like myosin light chain that binds to iq motifs of a class v myosin, myop, and an iqgap related protein, iqgp, playing a role in polarized growth and cytokinesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the crystal structures of mlcp bound to iq and iq of myop differ dramatically. when bound to iq, mlcp adopts a compact conformation in which both the n and c lobes interact with the iq motif. however, in the complex with iq, the n lobe no longer interacts with the iq motif, resulting in an extended conformation of mlcp. the two light chain structures relate to two distinct subfamilies of iq motifs, one of which does not interact with the n lobes of calmodulin like light chains. the correlation between light chain structure and iq sequence is demonstrated further by sedimentation velocity analysis of complexes of mlcp with iq motifs from myop and iqgp. the resulting 'free' n lobes of myosin light chains in the extended conformation could mediate the formation of ternary complexes during protein localization and/or partner recruitment.
