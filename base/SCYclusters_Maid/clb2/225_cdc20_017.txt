inhibitory phosphorylation of the apc regulator hct is controlled by the kinase cdc and the phosphatase cdc.. . background. exit from mitosis requires inactivation of mitotic cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). a key mechanism of cdk inactivation is ubiquitin mediated cyclin proteolysis, which is triggered by the late mitotic activation of a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase promoting complex (apc). activation of the apc requires its association with substoichiometric activating subunits termed cdc and hct (also known as cdh). here, we explore the molecular function and regulation of the apc regulatory subunit hct in saccharomyces cerevisiae. results. recombinant hct activated the cyclin ubiquitin ligase activity of apc isolated from multiple cell cycle stages. apc isolated from cells arrested in g, or in late mitosis due to the cdc mutation, was more responsive to hct than apc isolated from other stages. we found that hct was phosphorylated in vivo at multiple cdk consensus sites during cell cycle stages when activity of the cyclin dependent kinase cdc is high and apc activity is low. purified hct was phosphorylated in vitro at these sites by purified cdc cyclin complexes, and phosphorylation abolished the ability of hct to activate the apc in vitro. the phosphatase cdc, which is known to be required for apc activation in vivo, was able to reverse the effects of cdc by catalyzing hct dephosphorylation and activation. conclusions. we conclude that hct phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism in the control of cyclin destruction. phosphorylation of hct provides a mechanism by which cdc blocks its own inactivation during s phase and early mitosis. following anaphase, dephosphorylation of hct by cdc may help initiate cyclin destruction.
