the rsf gene regulates septum formation in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . septum formation in the mitotic cell cycle of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs by conversion of the chitin ring, laid down at bud formation, into the primary septum. we show here that under certain conditions this septation is dependent on the newly identified rsf gene. however, cells harboring the rsf mutation accumulated in a postcytokinesis state, with delayed conversion of the chitin rich annulus into the primary septum. this rsf mediated inhibition of septum formation only occurred under conditions of biosynthetic stress and was correlated with biosynthetically mediated inhibition of the cell cycle regulatory step start. the rsf gene is distinct from the chs chitin synthase gene that is responsible for septation, and thus rsf most likely encodes a regulator of chitin synthesis. we hypothesize that rsf activity facilitates septum formation during times of biosynthetic stress, to allow efficient septation even under these conditions.
