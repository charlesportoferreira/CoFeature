regulation of metallothionein genes by the ace and amt transcription factors.. . the amt metalloregulatory trans acting factor from candida glabrata was found to functionally mimic the ace metalloregulatory trans acting factor from saccharomyces cerevisiae in the copper induced expression of the chromosomal s. cerevisiae metallothionein gene. plasmid constructs with promoters of various metal inducible genes fused to the bacterial beta galactosidase (lacz) reporter gene were used in s. cerevisiae to evaluate the roles of ace and amt in mediating metal stimulated expression. promoters from the s. cerevisiae cup gene and cu,zn superoxide dismutase (sod) and from the c. glabrata mt genes mti, mtiia, and mtiib were used. the ace factor was effective in the metalloregulation of the two s. cerevisiae promoters, cup and sod, but of only one c. glabrata promoter, mti. amt was found to be effective in the metalloregulation of all three c. glabrata mt promoters and the two s. cerevisiae promoters tested. the regulation mediated by both ace and amt was copper dependent and copper specific. episomally expressed swi, a distinct trans acting factor of s. cerevisiae, enhanced only the basal expression from promoters. the swi enhancement was not metal dependent. in conclusion, amt and ace are functionally homologous in metal specific regulation, amt appears to be more promiscuous than ace in this function.
