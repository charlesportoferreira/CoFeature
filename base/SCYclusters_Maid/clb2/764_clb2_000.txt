rnase mrp cleaves the clb mrna to promote cell cycle progression. novel method of mrna degradation.. . rnase mitochondrial rna processing (rnase mrp) mutants have been shown to have an exit from mitosis defect that is caused by an increase in clb mrna levels, leading to increased clbp (b cyclin) levels and a resulting late anaphase delay. here we describe the molecular defect behind this delay. clb mrna normally disappears rapidly as cells complete mitosis, but the level remains high in rnase mrp mutants. this is in direct contrast to other exit from mitosis mutants and is the result of an increase in clb mrna stability. we found that highly purified rnase mrp cleaved the ' untranslated region (utr) of the clb mrna in several places in an in vitro assay. in vivo, we identified rnase mrp dependent cleavage products on the clb mrna that closely matched in vitro products. disposal of these products was dependent on the ' &gt;' exoribonuclease xrn and not the exosome. our results demonstrate that the endoribonuclease rnase mrp specifically cleaves the clb mrna in its ' utr to allow rapid ' to ' degradation by the xrn nuclease. degradation of the clb mrna by the rnase mrp endonuclease provides a novel way to regulate the cell cycle that complements the protein degradation machinery. in addition, these results denote a new mechanism of mrna degradation not seen before in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.
