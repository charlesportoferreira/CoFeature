iqgap is a component of cdc signaling to the cytoskeleton.. . the ras gap related protein iqgap binds several proteins, including actin, calmodulin, e cadherin and the rho family gtpase cdc. to gain insight into its in vivo function, iqgap was overexpressed in mammalian cells. transfection of iqgap significantly increased the levels of active, gtp bound cdc, resulting in the formation of peripheral actin microspikes. by contrast, transfection of an iqgap mutant lacking part of the gap related domain (iqgapdeltagrd) substantially decreased the amount of gtp bound cdc in cell lysates. consistent with these findings, iqgapdeltagrd blocked cdc function in cells that stably overexpress constitutively active cdc and abrogated the effect of bradykinin on cdc. in cells transfected with iqgapdeltagrd, bradykinin was unable to activate cdc, translocate cdc to the membrane fraction, or induce filopodia production. iqgapdeltagrd transfection altered cellular morphology, producing small, round cells that closely resemble cdc / cells. some insight into the mechanism was provided by in vitro analysis, which revealed that iqgapdeltagrd increased the intrinsic gtpase activity of cdc, thereby increasing the amount of inactive, gdp bound cdc. these data imply that iqgap has a crucial role in transducing cdc signaling to the cytoskeleton.
