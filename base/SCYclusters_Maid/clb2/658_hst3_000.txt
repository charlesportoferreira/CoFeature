a novel yeast silencer. the mu origin of saccharomyces cerevisiae has hst , mig and sir dependent silencing activity.. . silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae is found at the mating type loci hmr and hml, in subtelomeric regions, and at the rdna locus. repressed chromatin is built up by the recruitment of the sir proteins via their interaction with dna binding proteins that bind to silencers. here, we have performed a genetic screen for novel sequence elements within the yeast genome that display silencing activity. we isolated as a novel silencer element the origin of replication from the endogenous mu plasmid (mu ars). mu ars mediated silencing was dependent upon the sir proteins, the origin recognition complex (orc), and hst, a sir histone deacetylase homolog, suggesting that it constituted a novel class of silencing in yeast. moreover, mu ars carried a binding site for mig, a transcriptional repressor of glucose regulated genes. both the mig binding site and the mig gene were necessary for full silencing activity of mu ars. furthermore, hst was physically present at mu ars in a silencing context as well as at the endogenous mu plasmid. also, hst regulated the repression of the flipase gene, although this was likely an indirect effect of hst on flp expression.
