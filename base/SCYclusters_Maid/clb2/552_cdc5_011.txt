disruption of the yrb gene retards nuclear protein export, causing a profound mitotic delay, and can be rescued by overexpression of xpo/crm.. . disruption of the yrb gene encoding a nuclear ran binding protein homologous to yrbp/ranbp makes saccharomyces cerevisiae cold sensitive for colony formation, but not for growth in liquid medium. schizosaccharomyces pombe hbap, which is homologous to saccharomyces cerevisiae yrbp, rescued the cold sensitivity of deltayrb cells. when released from an alpha factor block, deltayrb cells underwent a prolonged delay at the short spindle stage of mitosis with a normal level of clb/p(cdc) kinase activity, but there was no chromosome loss, this being consistent with the finding that deltayrb was synthetic lethal with neither deltamad nor deltamad. the cold sensitive colony formation of deltayrb cells was rescued by both xpo/crm and gsp, but not cdc, carried on a multicopy vector. xpo/crm rescued deltayrb even in a single copy. consistent with such a tight functional interaction, xpop/crmp directly bound to yrbp, but not yrbp, and deltayrb cells were found to have a defect in nuclear export signal (nes) dependent nuclear protein export. from these results together, the ability of xpo/crmp to export nes proteins is suggested to be enhanced by both yrbp and gspp, and thereby disruption of yrb retards nuclear protein export, resulting in the mitotic delay.
