the ras/protein kinase a pathway acts in parallel with the mob/cbk pathway to effect cell cycle progression and proper bud site selection.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ras proteins connect nutrient availability to cell growth through regulation of protein kinase a (pka) activity. ras proteins also have pka independent functions in mitosis and actin repolarization. we have found that mutations in mob or cbk confer a slow growth phenotype in a rasdelta background. the slow growth phenotype of mobdelta rasdelta cells results from a g delay that is accompanied by an increase in size, suggesting a g/s role for ras not previously described. in addition, mobdelta strains have imprecise bud site selection, a defect exacerbated by deletion of ras. mob and cbk act to properly localize ace, a transcription factor that directs daughter cell specific transcription of several genes. the growth and budding phenotypes of the double deletion strains are ace independent but are suppressed by overexpression of the pka catalytic subunit, tpk. from these observations, we conclude that the pka pathway and mob/cbk act in parallel to determine bud site selection and promote cell cycle progression.
