identification of proline residues in the core cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of multidrug resistance protein (mrp/abcc) important for transport function, substrate specificity, and nucleotide interactions.. . multidrug resistance protein (mrp/abcc) is an atp binding cassette transporter that confers resistance to drugs and mediates the transport of organic anions. mrp has a core structure of two membrane spanning domains (msds) each followed by a nucleotide binding domain. this core structure is preceded by a third msd with five transmembrane (tm) helices, whereas msd and msd each contain six tm helices. we investigated the consequences of ala substitution of pro residues in both the non membrane and tm regions of msd and msd on mrp expression and organic anion transport function. all mrp pro mutants except pa were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells at levels comparable with wild type mrp. in addition, five mutants containing substitutions of pro residues in or proximal to the tm helices of msd (tm pro(), tm pro(), tm pro(), and tm pro()) and msd (tm pro()) exhibited significantly reduced transport of five organic anion substrates. in contrast, mutation of pro() in the cytoplasmic loop (cl) linking tm to tm caused a substantial increase in beta estradiol beta (d glucuronide) and methotrexate transport, whereas transport of other organic anions was reduced or unchanged. significant substrate specific changes in the atp dependence of transport and binding by the pa mutant were also observed. our findings demonstrate the importance of tm, tm, tm, tm, and tm in mrp transport function and suggest that cl may play a differential role in coupling the activity of the nucleotide binding domains to the translocation of different substrates across the membrane.
