tcnp/crzp, a calcineurin dependent transcription factor that differentially regulates gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . ca+ signals regulate gene expression in animal and yeast cells through mechanisms involving calcineurin, a protein phosphatase activated by binding ca+ and calmodulin. tcnp, also named crzp, was identified as a transcription factor in yeast required for the calcineurin dependent induction of pmc, pmr, pmra, and fks which confer tolerance to high ca+, mn+, na+, and cell wall damage, respectively. tcnp was not required for other calcineurin dependent processes, such as inhibition of a vacuolar h+/ca+ exchanger and inhibition of a pheromone stimulated ca+ uptake system, suggesting that tcnp functions downstream of calcineurin on a branch of the calcium signaling pathway leading to gene expression. tcnp contains three zinc finger motifs at its carboxyl terminus resembling the dna binding domains of zif, swip, and other transcription factors. when fused to the transcription activation domain of galp, the carboxy terminal domain of tcnp directed strong calcineurin independent expression of pmc lacz and other target genes. the amino terminal domain of tcnp was found to function as a calcineurin dependent transcription activation domain when fused to the dna binding domain of galp. this amino terminal domain also formed ca+ dependent and fk sensitive interactions with calcineurin in the yeast two hybrid assay. these findings suggest that tcnp functions as a calcineurin dependent transcription factor. interestingly, induction of tcnp dependent genes was found to be differentially controlled in response to physiological ca+ signals generated by treatment with mating pheromone and high salt. we propose that different promoters are sensitive to variations in the strength of ca+ signals generated by these stimuli and to effects of other signaling pathways.
