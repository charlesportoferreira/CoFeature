cell cycle analysis and chromosomal localization of human plk, a putative homologue of the mitotic kinases drosophila polo and saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc.. . polo and cdc are two genes required for passage through mitosis in drosophila melanogaster and saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. both genes encode structurally related protein kinases that have been implicated in regulating the function of the mitotic spindle. here, we report the characterization of a human protein kinase that displays extensive sequence similarity to drosophila polo and s. cerevisiae cdc; we refer to this kinase as plk (for polo like kinase ). the largest open reading frame of the plk cdna encodes a protein of , daltons, and a protein of this size is detected by immunoblotting of hela cell extracts with monoclonal antibodies raised against the c terminal part of plk expressed in escherichia coli. northern blot analysis of rna isolated from human cells and mouse tissues shows that a single plk mrna of . kb is highly expressed in tissues with a high mitotic index, consistent with a possible function of plk in cell proliferation. the plk gene maps to position p on chromosome , a locus for which no associations with neoplastic malignancies are known. the plk protein levels and its distribution change during the cell cycle, in a manner consistent with a role of plk in mitosis. thus, like drosophila polo and s. cerevisiae cdc, human plk is likely to function in cell cycle progression.
