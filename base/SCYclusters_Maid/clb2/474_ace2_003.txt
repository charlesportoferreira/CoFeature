intramolecular interaction of yeast tfiib in transcription control.. . the general transcription factor tfiib is a key component in the eukaryotic rna polymerase ii (rnapii) transcriptional machinery. we have previously shown that a yeast tfiib mutant (called yrm) with four amino acid residues in a species specific region changed to corresponding human residues affects the expression of genes activated by different activators in vivo. we report here that yrm can interact with several affected activators in vitro. in addition, yrm and other mutants with amino acid alterations within the same region can interact with tata binding protein (tbp) and rnapii normally. however, yrm is defective in supporting activator independent transcription in assays con ducted both in vitro and in vivo. we further demonstrate that the interaction between the c terminal core domain and the n terminal region is weakened in yrm and other related tfiib mutants. these results suggest that the intramolecular interaction property of yeast tfiib plays an important role in transcription regulation in cells.
