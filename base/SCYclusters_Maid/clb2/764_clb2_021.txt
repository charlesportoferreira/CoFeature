members of the nap/set family of proteins interact specifically with b type cyclins.. . cyclin dependent kinase complexes that contain the same catalytic subunit are able to induce different events at different times during the cell cycle, but the mechanisms by which they do so remain largely unknown. to address this problem, we have used affinity chromatography to identify proteins that bind specifically to mitotic cyclins, with the goal of finding proteins that interact with mitotic cyclins to carry out the events of mitosis. this approach has led to the identification of a kd protein called nap that interacts specifically with members of the cyclin b family. this interaction has been highly conserved during evolution. nap in the xenopus embryo interacts with cyclins b and b, but not with cyclin a, and the s. cerevisiae homolog of nap interacts with clb but not with clb. genetic experiments in budding yeast indicate that nap plays an important role in the function of clb, while biochemical experiments demonstrate that purified nap can be phosphorylated by cyclin b/pcdc kinase complexes, but not by cyclin a/pcdc kinase complexes. these results suggest that nap is a protein involved in the specific functions of cyclin b/pcdc kinase complexes. in addition to nap, we found a kd protein in xenopus that is homologous to nap and also interacts specifically with b type cyclins. this protein is the xenopus homolog of the human set protein, which was previously identified as part of a putative oncogenic fusion protein (von lindern et al., ).
