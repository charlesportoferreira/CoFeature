multigenerational cortical inheritance of the rax protein in orienting polarity and division in yeast.. . diploid yeast cells repeatedly polarize and bud from their poles, probably because of highly stable marks of unknown composition. here, rax, a membrane protein, was shown to behave as such a mark. the rax protein itself was inherited immutably at the cell cortex for multiple generations, and rax was shown to have a half life exceeding several generations. the persistent inheritance of cortical protein markers would provide a means to couple a cell's history to the future development of a precise morphogenetic form.
