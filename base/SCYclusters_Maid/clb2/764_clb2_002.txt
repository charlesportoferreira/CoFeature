involvement of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of yeast nap in mitotic progression.. . nucleosome assembly protein (nap) is widely conserved from yeasts to humans and facilitates nucleosome formation in vitro as a histone chaperone. nap is generally localized in the cytoplasm, except that subcellular localization of drosophila melanogaster nap is dynamically regulated between the cytoplasm and nucleus during early development. the cytoplasmic localization of nap is seemingly incompatible with the proposed role of nap in nucleosome formation, which should occur in the nucleus. here, we have examined the roles of a putative nuclear export signal (nes) sequence in yeast nap (ynap). ynap mutants lacking the nes like sequence were localized predominantly in the nucleus. deletion of nap in cells harboring a single mitotic cyclin gene is known to cause mitotic delay and temperature sensitive growth. a wild type nap complemented these phenotypes while nap mutant genes lacking the nes like sequence or carboxy terminal region did not. these and other results suggest that ynap is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and that its shuttling is important for ynap function during mitotic progression. this study also provides a possible explanation for nap's involvement in nucleosome assembly and/or remodeling in the nucleus.
