cks dependent proteasome recruitment and activation of cdc transcription in budding yeast.. . cks proteins are small evolutionarily conserved proteins that interact genetically and physically with cyclin dependent kinases. however, in spite of a large body of genetic, biochemical and structural research, no compelling unifying model of their functions has emerged. here we show, by investigating the essential role of cks in saccharomyces cerevisiae, that the protein is primarily involved in promoting mitosis by modulating the transcriptional activation of the apc/c protein ubiquitin ligase activator cdc. cks is required for both the periodic dissociation of cdc kinase from the cdc promoter and the periodic association of the proteasome with the promoter. we propose that the essential role of cks is to recruit the proteasome to, and/or dissociate the cdc kinase from, the cdc promoter, thus facilitating transcription by remodelling transcriptional complexes or chromatin associated with the cdc gene.
