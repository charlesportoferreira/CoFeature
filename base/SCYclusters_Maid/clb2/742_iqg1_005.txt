an iqgap related protein controls actin ring formation and cytokinesis in yeast.. . background. proteins of the iqgap family have been identified as candidate effectors for the rho family of gtpases; however, little is known about their cellular functions. the domain structures of iqgap family members make them excellent candidates as regulators of the cytoskeleton. their sequences include an actin binding domain homologous to that found in calponin, iq motifs for interaction with calmodulin, and a gtpase binding domain. results. the genomic sequence of saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a single gene encoding an iqgap family member (denoted iqgap related protein. iqg). iqg and iqgaps share similarity along their entire length, with an amino terminal calponin homology (ch) domain, iq repeats, and a conserved carboxyl terminus. in contrast to iqgaps, iqg lacks an identifiable gap motif, a ww domain, and ir repeats, although the functions of these domains in iqgaps are not well defined. deletion of the iqg gene resulted in lethality. cellular defects included a deficiency in cytokinesis, altered actin organization, aberrant nuclear segregation, and cell lysis. the primary defect appeared to be a cytokinesis defect, and the other problems possibly arose as a consequence of this initial defect. consistent with a role in cytokinesis, iqg co localizes with an actin ring encircling the mother bud neck late in the cell cycle a putative cytokinetic ring. iqg overexpression resulted in premature actin ring formation, suggesting that iqg activity temporally controls formation of this structure during the cell cycle. conclusions. yeast iqgap related protein, iqg, is an important regulator of cellular morphogenesis, inducing actin ring formation in association with cytokinesis.
