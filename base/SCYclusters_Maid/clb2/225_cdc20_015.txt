a novel mutant allele of the chromatin bound fission yeast checkpoint protein rad separates the dna structure checkpoints.. . to further dissect the genetic differences between the checkpoint pathway following s phase cdc arrest versus dna damage, a genetic screen was performed for checkpoint mutants that were unable to arrest mitosis following cell cycle arrest with a temperature sensitive dna polymerase delta mutant, cdc m. one such checkpoint mutant, rad d, was found to display the cut phenotype following s phase arrest by cdc m, but not by the dna synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea, reminiscent of the chk mutant. unlike chk , rad d was not sensitive to uv irradiation. interestingly, the ionising radiation sensitivity of rad d was only at higher doses, and cells were found to be defective in properly arresting cell division following irradiation in s phase, but not g() phase. biochemical analysis attributes the checkpoint defects of rad d to the failure to phosphorylate the checkpoint effector chkp. to investigate if radp monitors the genome for abnormal dna structures specifically during dna synthesis, chromatin association of radp was analysed. radp was found to be chromatin associated throughout the cell cycle, not just during s phase. this interaction occurred irrespective of the arrest with cdc m and, surprisingly, was also independent of the other checkpoint rad proteins, and the cell cycle effectors chkp and cdsp.
