identification of a kd protein in escherichia coli related to a yeast heavy chain myosin.. . a high molecular weight protein from escherichia coli sharing structural homology at the protein level with a yeast heavy chain myosin encoded by the myo gene is described. this kd protein ( hmp) can be enriched in cell fractions following the procedure normally utilized for the purification of non muscle myosins. in western blots this protein cross reacts with a monoclonal antibody against yeast heavy chain myosin. moreover, antibodies raised against the kd protein cross react with the yeast myosin and with a myosin heavy chain from chicken. recognition by anti hmp antibodies of an overexpressed fragment of yeast myosin encoded by myo allows the localization of one of the shared epitopes to a specific region around the atp binding site of the yeast myosin heavy chain. the existence of a high molecular weight protein with structural similarity to myosin in e. coli raises the possibility that such a protein might generate the force required for movement in processes such as nucleoid segregation and cell division.
