the role of saccharomyces cerevisiae type a phosphatase in the actin cytoskeleton and in entry into mitosis.. . we have prepared a temperature sensitive saccharomyces cerevisiae type a phosphatase (ppa) mutant, pph . at the restrictive temperature, the pph cells arrested predominantly with small or aberrant buds, and their actin cytoskeleton and chitin deposition were abnormal. the involvement of ppa in bud growth may be due to the role of ppa in actin distribution during the cell cycle. moreover, after a shift to the non permissive temperature, the pph cells were blocked in g and had low activity of clb cdc kinase. expression of clb from the s.cerevisiae adh promoter in pph cells was able to partially bypass the g arrest in the first cell cycle, but was not able to stimulate passage through a second mitosis. these cells had higher total amounts of clb cdc kinase activity, but the clb normalized specific activity was lower in the pph cells compared with wild type cells. unlike wild type strains, a ppa deficient strain was sensitive to the loss of mih, which is a homolog of the schizosaccharomyces pombe mitotic inducer cdc+. furthermore, the cdcf mutation cured the synthetic defects of a ppa deficient strain containing a deletion of mih. these results suggest that ppa is required during g for the activation of clb cdc kinase complexes for progression into mitosis.
