the role of the lissencephaly protein pac during nuclear migration in budding yeast.. . during mitosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mitotic spindle moves into the mother bud neck via dynein dependent sliding of cytoplasmic microtubules along the cortex of the bud. here we show that pac, the yeast homologue of the human lissencephaly protein lis, plays a key role in this process. first, genetic interactions placed pac in the dynein/dynactin pathway. second, cells lacking pac failed to display microtubule sliding in the bud, resulting in defective mitotic spindle movement and nuclear segregation. third, pac localized to the plus ends (distal tips) of cytoplasmic microtubules in the bud. this localization did not depend on the dynein heavy chain dyn. moreover, the pac fluorescence intensity at the microtubule end was enhanced in cells lacking dynactin or the cortical attachment molecule num. fourth, dynein heavy chain dyn also localized to the tips of cytoplasmic microtubules in wild type cells. dynein localization required pac and, like pac, was enhanced in cells lacking the dynactin component arp or the cortical attachment molecule num. our results suggest that pac targets dynein to microtubule tips, which is necessary for sliding of microtubules along the bud cortex. dynein must remain inactive until microtubule ends interact with the bud cortex, at which time dynein and pac appear to be offloaded from the microtubule to the cortex.
