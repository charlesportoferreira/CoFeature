elevated recombination and pairing structures during meiotic arrest in yeast of the nuclear division mutant cdc.. . a diploid strain of yeast, homozygous for the mutation cdc , undergoes a normal meiosis at degrees c. at the nonpermissive temperature of degrees c, meiosis is arrested at the first meiotic division, after premeiotic dna replication and recombination commitment have taken place. haploidisation commitment does not occur at degrees c. electron microscopy reveals that synaptons (synaptonemal complexes) are formed and the stage of arrest is characterised by a prevalence of &quot;modified synaptons&quot;, which consist of paired lateral elements lacking the central elements. prolonged incubation at this stage of arrest results in unusually high recombination levels, perhaps related to the synaptonal structures observed. temperature shift up experiments (transfers of cell from degrees c to degrees c at various times during meiosis) reveal that the cdc function is required for both the first and the second divisions of meiosis.
