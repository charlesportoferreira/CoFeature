the role of phosphorylation and the cdc protein kinase in cell cycle regulated nuclear import of the s. cerevisiae transcription factor swi.. . the intracellular localization of the s. cerevisiae transcription factor swi is cell cycle dependent. the protein is nuclear in g cells but cytoplasmic in s, g, and m phase cells. we have identified swi's nuclear localization signal (nls) and show that it can confer cell cycle dependent nuclear entry to a heterologous protein. located within or close to the nls are three serine residues, mutation of which results in constitutive nuclear entry. these residues are phosphorylated in a cell cycle dependent manner in vivo, being phosphorylated when swi is in the cytoplasm and dephosphorylated when it is in the nucleus. as all three serines are phosphorylated by purified cdc dependent h kinase activity in vitro, we propose a model in which the cdc kinase acts directly to control nuclear entry of swi.
