diploid spore formation and other meiotic effects of two cell division cycle mutations of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the meiotic effects of two cell division cycle mutations of saccharomyces cerevisiae (cdc and cdc) have been examined. these mutations were isolated by l.h. hartwell and his colleagues and characterized as defective in mitosis, causing a temperature sensitive arrest in late nuclear division. when subjected to the restrictive temperature in meiosis, diploid cells homozygous for either of these mutations generally proceeded through premeiotic dna synthesis and commitment to meiotic levels of recombination, but then arrested at a stage following spindle pole body (spb) duplication and separation. the two spbs lacked the interconnection by spindle microtubules typical of the complete meiosis i spindle. challenge of these homozygotes by a semi restrictive temperature often caused the production of asci containing two diploid spores. genetic analysis of the viable pairs of spores revealed that each spore had become homozygous for centromere linked markers significantly more frequently than for distal markers, indicating that the two spores each contained pairs of sister centromeres that had co segregated in the reductional division of meiosis i. ultrastructural analysis of the cdc homozygote demonstrated that these cells had completed meiosis i and formed two meiosis ii spindles, but that the latter remained unusually short. this resulted in the encapsulation of both poles of each spindle within a single spore wall. these mutations therefore are defective in both meiotic divisions, as well as in the mitotic division described originally.
