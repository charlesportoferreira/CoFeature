gametogenesis in yeast is regulated by a transcriptional cascade dependent on ndt.. . gametogenesis requires the successful coordination of two key processes, meiotic nuclear division and gamete morphogenesis. a central regulatory step in progression through gametogenesis occurs at the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase. we find that ndt functions at pachytene of yeast gametogenesis (sporulation) to activate transcription of a set of genes required for both meiotic division (e.g., b type cyclins) and gamete formation (e.g., sps). ectopic synthesis of ndt in vegetative cells induces transcription of these genes, and recombinant ndt protein binds to a conserved sequence in their upstream region. transcription of ndt itself is dependent on ime, which activates expression of early sporulation genes. transcription of the ndt regulated gene clb is mediated by the checkpoint gene rad. thus ndt is a pivotal component of a transcriptional cascade programming yeast gametogenesis and may also be a target of meiotic checkpoint control.
