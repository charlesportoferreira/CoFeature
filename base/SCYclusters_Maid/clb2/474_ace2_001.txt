the endo beta , glucanase engp is required for dissolution of the primary septum during cell separation in schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . schizosaccharomyces pombe cells divide by medial fission throughout contraction of an actomyosin ring and deposition of a multilayered division septum that must be cleaved to release the two daughter cells. although many studies have focused on the actomoysin ring and septum assembly, little information is available concerning the mechanism of cell separation. here we describe the characterization of eng+, a new gene that encodes a protein with detectable endo beta , glucanase activity and whose deletion is not lethal to the cells but does interfere in their separation. electron microscopic observation of mutant cells indicated that this defect is mainly due to the failure of the cells to degrade the primary septum, a structure rich in beta , glucans, that separates the two sisters cells. expression of eng+ varies during the cell cycle, maximum expression being observed before septation, and the protein localizes to a ring like structure that surrounds the septum region during cell separation. this suggests that it could also be involved in the cleavage of the cylinder of the cell wall that covers the division septum. the expression of eng+ during vegetative growth is regulated by a ch zinc finger protein (encoded by the spacg.c orf), which shows significant sequence similarity to the saccharomyces cerevisiae scacep, especially in the zinc finger region. mutants lacking this transcriptional regulator (which we have named ace+) show a severe cell separation defect, hyphal growth being observed. thus, acep may regulate the expression of the eng+ gene together with that of other genes whose products are also involved in cell separation.
