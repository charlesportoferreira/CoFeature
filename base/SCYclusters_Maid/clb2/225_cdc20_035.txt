the cdc gene product of saccharomyces cerevisiae, a beta transducin homolog, is required for a subset of microtubule dependent cellular processes.. . previous analysis of cdc mutants of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that the cdc gene product (cdcp) is required for two microtubule dependent processes, nuclear movements prior to anaphase and chromosome separation. here we report that cdc mutants are defective for a third microtubule mediated event, nuclear fusion during mating of g cells, but appear normal for a fourth microtubule dependent process, nuclear migration after dna replication. therefore, cdcp is required for a subset of microtubule dependent processes and functions at multiple stages in the life cycle. consistent with this interpretation, we find that cdc cells arrested by alpha factor or at the restrictive temperature accumulate anomalous microtubule structures, as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. the anomalous microtubule staining patterns are due to cdc because intragenic revertants that revert the temperature sensitivity have normal microtubule morphologies. cdc mutants have a sevenfold increase in the intensity of antitubulin fluorescence in intranuclear spindles compared with spindles from wild type cells, yet the total amount of tubulin is indistinguishable by western immunoblot analysis. this result suggests that cdcp modulates microtubule structure in wild type cells either by promoting microtubule disassembly or by altering the surface of the microtubules. finally, we cloned and sequenced cdc and show that it encodes a member of a family of proteins that share homology to the beta subunit of transducin.
