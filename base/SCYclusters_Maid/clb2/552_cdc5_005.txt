physical interaction of cdc with cdc in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cdc protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae is thought to be a kinase targeting subunit of the chaperone hsp. in a genetic screen, four protein kinases were identified as interacting with cdc cdc, cdc, cdc and cak. this result underlines the importance of cdc for the folding of protein kinases. in addition, we showed that ydj, a yeast dnaj homolog belonging to the hsp family of chaperones, genetically interacts with cdc. no physical interaction has so far been detected between cdc and cdc, although genetic interactions (synthetic lethality and mutation suppression), and biochemical studies have suggested that these two proteins functionally interact. we found that, when separately expressed, the n terminal lobe of cdc interacted strongly with the c terminal moiety of cdc in a two hybrid system. this was not the case for the full length cdc protein. we present models to explain these results.
