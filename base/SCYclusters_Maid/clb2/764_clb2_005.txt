inhibition of apc mediated proteolysis by the meiosis specific protein kinase ime.. . proteolysis triggered by the anaphase promoting complex (apc) is needed for sister chromatid separation and the exit from mitosis. apc is a ubiquitin ligase whose activity is tightly controlled during the cell cycle. to identify factors involved in the regulation of apc mediated proteolysis, a saccharomyces cerevisiae gal cdna library was screened for genes whose overexpression prevented degradation of an apc target protein, the mitotic cyclin clb. genes encoding g, s, and mitotic cyclins were identified, consistent with previous data showing that the cyclin dependent kinase cdk associated with different cyclins is a key factor for inhibiting apc(cdh) activity from late g phase until mitosis. in addition, the meiosis specific protein kinase ime was identified as a negative regulator of apc mediated proteolysis. ectopic expression of ime in g arrested cells inhibited the degradation of mitotic cyclins and of other apc substrates. ime expression resulted in the phosphorylation of cdh in g cells, indicating that ime and cdk regulate apc(cdh) in a similar manner. the expression of ime in cycling cells inhibited bud formation and caused cells to arrest in mitosis. we show further that ime itself is an unstable protein whose proteolysis occurs independently of the apc and scf (skp/cdc/f box) ubiquitin ligases. our findings suggest that ime represents an unstable, meiosis specific regulator of apc(cdh).
