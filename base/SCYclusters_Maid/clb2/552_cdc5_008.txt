checkpoint adaptation precedes spontaneous and damage induced genomic instability in yeast.. . despite the fact that eukaryotic cells enlist checkpoints to block cell cycle progression when their dna is damaged, cells still undergo frequent genetic rearrangements, both spontaneously and in response to genotoxic agents. we and others have previously characterized a phenomenon (adaptation) in which yeast cells that are arrested at a dna damage checkpoint eventually override this arrest and reenter the cell cycle, despite the fact that they have not repaired the dna damage that elicited the arrest. here, we use mutants that are defective in checkpoint adaptation to show that adaptation is important for achieving the highest possible viability after exposure to dna damaging agents, but it also acts as an entree into some forms of genomic instability. specifically, the spontaneous and x ray induced frequencies of chromosome loss, translocations, and a repair process called break induced replication occur at significantly reduced rates in adaptation defective mutants. this indicates that these events occur after a cell has first arrested at the checkpoint and then adapted to that arrest. because malignant progression frequently involves loss of genes that function in dna repair, adaptation may promote tumorigenesis by allowing genomic instability to occur in the absence of repair.
