cfi prevents premature exit from mitosis by anchoring cdc phosphatase in the nucleolus.. . in eukaryotes, the activation of mitotic cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) induces mitosis, and their inactivation causes cells to leave mitosis. in budding yeast, two redundant mechanisms induce the inactivation of mitotic cdks. in one mechanism, a specialized ubiquitin dependent proteolytic system (called the apc dependent proteolysis machinery) degrades the mitotic (clb) cyclin subunit. in the other, the kinase inhibitor sic binds to mitotic cdks and inhibits their kinase activity. the highly conserved protein phosphatase cdc promotes both clb degradation and sic accumulation. cdc promotes sic transcription and the stabilization of sic protein by dephosphorylating sicl and its transcription factor swi. cdc activates the degradation of clb cyclins by dephosphorylating the apc specificity factor cdh. so how is cdc regulated? here we show that cdc is sequestered in the nucleolus for most of the cell cycle. during nuclear division, cdc is released from the nucleolus, allowing it to reach its targets. a highly conserved signalling cascade, critical for the exit from mitosis, is required for this movement of cdc during anaphase. furthermore, we have identified a negative regulator of cdc, cfi, that anchors cdc in the nucleolus.
