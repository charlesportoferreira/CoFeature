synergistic inhibition of apc/c by glucose and activated ras proteins can be mediated by each of the tpk proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . proteolysis triggered by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c) is essential for the progression through mitosis. apc/c is a highly conserved ubiquitin ligase whose activity is regulated during the cell cycle by various factors, including spindle checkpoint components and protein kinases. the camp dependent protein kinase (pka) was identified as negative regulator of apc/c in yeast and mammalian cells. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, pka activity is induced upon glucose addition or by activated ras proteins. this study shows that glucose and the activated ras(val) protein synergistically inhibit apc/c function via the camp/pka pathway in yeast. remarkably, ras proteins defective in the interaction with adenylate cyclase fail to influence apc/c, implying that its function is regulated exclusively by pka, but not by alternative ras pathways. furthermore, it is shown that the three pkas in yeast, tpk, tpk and tpk, have redundant functions in regulating apc/c in response to glucose medium. single or double deletions of tpk genes did not prevent inhibition of apc/c, suggesting that each of the tpk proteins can take over this function. however, tpk seems to inhibit apc/c function more efficiently than tpk and tpk. finally, evidence is provided that cdc is involved in apc/c regulation by the camp/pka pathway.
