a cyclin b homolog in s. cerevisiae. chronic activation of the cdc protein kinase by cyclin prevents exit from mitosis.. . a cyclin b homolog was identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae using degenerate oligonucleotides and the polymerase chain reaction. the protein, designated scb, has a high degree of similarity with b type cyclins from organisms ranging from fission yeast to human. levels of scb mrna and protein were found to be periodic through the cell cycle, with maximum accumulation late, most likely in the g interval. deletion of the gene was found not to be lethal, and subsequently other b type cyclins have been found in yeast functionally redundant with scb. a mutant allele of scb that removes an amino terminal fragment of the encoded protein thought to be required for efficient degradation during mitosis confers a mitotic arrest phenotype. this arrest can be reversed by inactivation of the cdc protein kinase, suggesting that cyclin mediated arrest results from persistent protein kinase activation.
