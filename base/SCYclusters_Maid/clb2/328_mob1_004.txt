initiation of cytokinesis is controlled through multiple modes of regulation of the sidp mobp kinase complex.. . the sidp mobp kinase complex is an important component of the septation initiation network (sin) in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. however, regulation of this complex is still elusive. here we show that mobp is required not only for the subcellular localization of sidp but also for its kinase activity. we identified a region at the amino terminus of sidp that is required for mobp binding and spindle pole body (spb) localization. deletion of this region abolishes mobp binding and diminishes spb localization, whereas this region alone is sufficient to associate with mobp and spbs. we further show that a similar region of the n terminus of the sidp related protein kinase orbp binds to the mobp related protein mobp, suggesting that this may be a conserved mode of interaction for this family of kinases. phosphorylation of ser and especially thr is important for sidp function. sidp with a mutation of thr to ala (ta) can no longer rescue sid mutant cells, and this results in reduction of mobp binding. sidp mutants mimicking phosphorylation at this site (td and te) can rescue sid cells, enhance sidp kinase activity, and partially rescue growth defects of upstream sin mutants. interestingly, sidp, but not mobp, is self associated. our experiments suggest that self associated sidp is inactive. this self association is mediated by a region that overlaps with mobp and spb binding sites. overexpression of mobp is able to disrupt the self association of sidp. taken together, our results suggest that sidp kinase may utilize multiple modes of regulation including self association, mobp binding, and phosphorylation to achieve its full activity at an appropriate time and place in the cell.
