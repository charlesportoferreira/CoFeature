budding yeast cdc. a target of the spindle checkpoint.. . the spindle checkpoint regulates the cell division cycle by keeping cells with defective spindles from leaving mitosis. in the two hybrid system, three proteins that are components of the checkpoint, mad, mad, and mad, were shown to interact with cdc, a protein required for exit from mitosis. mad and mad coprecipitated with cdc at all stages of the cell cycle. the binding of mad depended on mad and that of mad on mad and mad. overexpression of cdc allowed cells with a depolymerized spindle or damaged dna to leave mitosis but did not overcome the arrest caused by unreplicated dna. mutants in cdc that were resistant to the spindle checkpoint no longer bound mad proteins, suggesting that cdc is the target of the spindle checkpoint.
