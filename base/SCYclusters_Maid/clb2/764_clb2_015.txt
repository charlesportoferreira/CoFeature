molecular genetic analysis of rtsp, a b' regulatory subunit of saccharomyces cerevisiae protein phosphatase a.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene rts encodes a protein homologous to a variable b type regulatory subunit of the mammalian heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein phosphatase a (ppa). we present evidence showing that rtsp assembles into similar heterotrimeric complexes in yeast. strains in which rts has been disrupted are temperature sensitive (ts) for growth, are hypersensitive to ethanol, are unable to grow with glycerol as their only carbon source, and accumulate at nonpermissive temperatures predominantly as large budded cells with a n dna content and a nondivided nucleus. this cell cycle arrest can be overcome and partial suppression of the ts phenotype of rts null cells occurs if the gene clb, encoding a cdc kinase associated b type cyclin, is expressed on a high copy number plasmid. however, clb overexpression has no suppressive effects on other aspects of the rts null phenotype. expression of truncated forms of rtsp can also partially suppress the ts phenotype and can fully suppress the inability of cells to grow on glycerol and the hypersensitivity of cells to ethanol. by contrast, the truncated forms do not suppress the accumulation of large budded cells at high temperatures. coexpression of truncated rtsp and high levels of clbp fully suppresses the ts phenotype, indicating that the inhibition of growth of rts null cells at high temperatures is due to both stress related and cell cycle related defects. genetic analyses show that the role played by rtsp in ppa regulation is distinctly different from that played by the other known variable b regulatory subunit, cdcp, a protein recently implicated in checkpoint control regulation.
