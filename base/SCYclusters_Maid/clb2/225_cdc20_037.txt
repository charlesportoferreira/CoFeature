preliminary characterization of maturation promoting factor from yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . it has been known for some time that maturation promoting factor (mpf) appears in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells at m phase and exerts equal m phase promoting activity in both meiotic cells and mitotic cells in a non specific manner. mpf was extracted from cdc mutant cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae synchronized at m phase by incubation at the restrictive temperature. when injected into immature oocytes of xenopus laevis, yeast mpf caused meiosis reinitiation in a dose dependent manner and even in the presence of cycloheximide. yeast mpf exerted its activity in starfish oocytes as well. mpf activity was obtained only from cells in m phase and not from g, s or g phase cells, indicating cyclical changes during the yeast mitotic cell cycle. preliminary characterization of yeast mpf revealed that its activity was associated with a heat labile protein having a sedimentation coefficient value of s. in contrast to the current assumption that mpf is a ca sensitive phosphoprotein stabilized by phosphorylated small molecules, such as atp and na beta glycerophosphate, the present study revealed that yeast mpf was still active even after treatment with either ca+ or alkaline phosphatase. furthermore, it was found that yeast mpf and these phosphorylated small molecules were complementary in inducing reinitiation of meiosis, since the meiosis reinitiating activity was detected only when both were present simultaneously and almost undetectable when either of them was present alone.(abstract truncated at words)
