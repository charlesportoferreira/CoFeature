functional analysis of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ubc gene.. . ubc is the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene that is most similar in sequence to e c, a ubiquitin carrier protein required for the destruction of mitotic cyclins and proteins that maintain sister chromatid cohesion in animal cells and in schizosaccharomyces pombe. we have disrupted the ubc gene and found it is not essential for yeast cell viability even when combined with deletion of ubc, a gene that has also been implicated in mitotic cyclin destruction. ubcp does not ubiquitinate cyclin b in clam cell free extracts in vitro and the destruction of clbp is not impaired in extracts prepared from delta ubc or delta ubc delta ubc cells. these results suggest ubcp and ubcp together are not essential for mitotic cyclin destruction in s. cerevisiae and we can find no evidence to suggest that ubcp is the true functional homologue of e c.
