cdcp, the b type regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase a, has multiple functions in mitosis and is required for the kinetochore/spindle checkpoint in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae, like most eucaryotic cells, can prevent the onset of anaphase until chromosomes are properly aligned on the mitotic spindle. we determined that cdcp (regulatory b subunit of protein phosphatase a [ppa]) is required for the kinetochore/spindle checkpoint regulatory pathway in yeast. ctf cdc double mutants could not maintain a ctf induced mitotic delay, as determined by antitubulin staining and levels of histone h kinase activity. in addition, cdc.leu mutants and tpd.leu mutants (regulatory a subunit of ppa) were nocodazole sensitive and exhibited the phenotypes of previously identified kinetochore/spindle checkpoint mutants. inactivating cdc did not simply bypass the arrest that results from inhibiting ubiquitin dependent proteolysis because cdc cdc.leu and cdc cdc.leu double mutants arrested normally at elevated temperatures. cdc is specific for the kinetochore/spindle checkpoint because cdc mutants showed normal sensitivity to gamma radiation and hydroxyurea. the conditional lethality and the abnormal cellular morphogenesis of cdc.leu were suppressed by cdcf, suggesting that the cdc phenotypes are dependent on the phosphorylation state of cdcp. in contrast, the nocodazole sensitivity of cdc.leu was not suppressed by cdcf. therefore, the mitotic checkpoint activity of cdc (and tpd) is independent of regulated phosphorylation of cdcp. finally, cdc.leu suppresses the temperature sensitivity of cdc , suggesting additional roles for cdc in mitosis.
