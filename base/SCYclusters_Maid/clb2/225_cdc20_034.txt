saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc mutants arrested at a late stage in anaphase are rescued by xenopus cdnas encoding n ras or a protein with beta transducin repeats.. . we have constructed a xenopus oocyte cdna library in a saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector and used this library to isolate genes that can function in yeast cells to suppress the temperature sensitive [corrected] defect of the cdc mutation. two maternally expressed xenopus cdnas which fulfill these conditions have been isolated. one of these clones encodes xenopus n ras. in contrast to the yeast ras genes, xenopus n ras rescues the cdc mutation. moreover, overexpression of xenopus n ras in s. cerevisiae does not activate the ras cyclic amp (camp) pathway; rather, it results in decreased levels of intracellular camp in both mutant cdc and wild type cells. furthermore, we show that lowering camp levels is sufficient to allow cells with a nonfunctional cdc protein to complete the mitotic cycle. these results suggest that a key step of the cell cycle is dependent upon a phosphorylation event catalyzed by camp dependent protein kinase. the second clone, beta trcp (beta transducin repeat containing protein), encodes a protein of amino acids that shows significant homology to the beta subunits of g proteins in its c terminal half. in this region, beta trcp is composed of seven beta transducin repeats. beta trcp is not a functional homolog of s. cerevisiae cdc, a cell cycle gene that also contains beta transducin repeats and suppresses the cdc mutation.
