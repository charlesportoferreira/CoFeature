s. cerevisiae s protease mutants arrest cell division in g/metaphase.. . we isolated two mutants from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, cim and cim , that arrest cell division in g/metaphase at degrees c. cim (identical to sug; ref. ) and cim are similar to each other and are members of a family of putative atpases that have been proposed to be s protease subunits. we show here that cim is the functional yeast homologue of the human mss protein and that homologues of cim and cim are present in a highly purified preparation of the drosophila s protease. the short lived ubiquitin proline beta galactosidase fusion protein is stabilized in cim mutants, but leu beta galactosidase is not. the clb and clb cyclins also accumulate in the cim mutants. thus the s protease is required in vivo for the degradation of ubiquitinated substrates and for anaphase chromosome separation.
