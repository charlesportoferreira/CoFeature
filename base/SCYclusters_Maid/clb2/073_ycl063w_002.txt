identification of an organelle specific myosin v receptor.. . class v myosins are widely distributed among diverse organisms and move cargo along actin filaments. some myosin vs move multiple types of cargo, where the timing of movement and the destinations of selected cargoes are unique. here, we report the discovery of an organelle specific myosin v receptor. vacp, a novel protein, is a component of the vacuole specific receptor for myop, a saccharomyces cerevisiae myosin v. vacp interacts with the myop cargo binding domain, but not with vacuole inheritance defective myo mutants that have single amino acid changes within this region. moreover, a region of the myop tail required specifically for secretory vesicle transport is neither required for vacuole inheritance nor for vacp myop interactions. vacp is localized on the vacuole membrane, and vacuole associated myop increases in proportion with an increase in vacp. furthermore, vacp is not required for movement of other cargo moved by myop. these findings demonstrate that vacp is a component of a vacuole specific receptor for myop. organelle specific receptors such as vacp provide a mechanism whereby a single type of myosin v can move diverse cargoes to distinct destinations at different times.
