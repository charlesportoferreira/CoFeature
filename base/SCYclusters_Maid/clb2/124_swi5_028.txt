altering dna binding specificity of gal requires sequences adjacent to the zinc finger.. . many eukaryotic proteins involved in transcriptional regulation contain within their dna binding domains a polypeptide loop (the zinc finger) which interacts with dna. in proteins possessing multiple zinc fingers, including tfiiia, sp, swi and oestrogen/glucocorticoid receptors, the region containing the zinc fingers confers dna binding specificity. by contrast, our results demonstrate that all but one of the amino acids encompassing the single zinc finger region of gal, the yeast transcriptional activator, can be replaced with the analogous zinc finger region from another yeast activator protein, ppr, without changing the dna binding specificity of gal. a amino acid region adjacent to the zinc finger is necessary for determining specific recognition of dna sequences.
