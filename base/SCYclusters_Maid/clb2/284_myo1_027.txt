the yeast myo gene encoding a myosin like protein required for cell division.. . a yeast gene myo that contains regions of substantial sequence homology with the nematode muscle myosin gene (unc) has been isolated and sequenced. although the disruption of myo is not lethal, it leads to aberrant nuclear migration and cytokinesis. the kd myosin heavy chain like protein, the product of myo, cross reacts with anti nematode myosin heavy chain igg and is present in wild type strains but not in strains carrying the disrupted gene. instead, a truncated polypeptide with a molecular mass of kd can be detected in some myo mutants.
