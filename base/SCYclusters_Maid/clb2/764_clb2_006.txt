cdc clb mitotic kinase negatively regulates bud site assembly in the budding yeast.. . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, a prospective mother normally commences the formation of a daughter (the bud) only in the g() phase of the cell division cycle. this suggests a strict temporal regulation of the processes that initiate the formation of a new bud. using cortical localization of bud site components spa and bni as an indicator of bud site assembly, we show that cells assemble a bud site following inactivation of the cdc clb mitotic kinase but prior to start. interestingly, an untimely inactivation of the mitotic kinase is sufficient to drive cells to assemble a new bud site inappropriately in g() or m phases. the induction of cdc/clb kinase activity in g(), on the other hand, dramatically reduces a cell's ability to construct an incipient bud site. our findings strongly suggest that the cdc clb kinase plays a critical role in the mechanism that restricts the timing of bud formation to the g() phase of the cell cycle.
