the spgp gtpase is an essential, dosage dependent inducer of septum formation in schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . the spg gene (septum promoting gtpase) was cloned as a multicopy suppressor of a dominant negative mutant of the cdcp kinase. it encodes a small gtpase of the ras superfamily. spg is an essential gene. null or heat sensitive alleles do not make a division septum, but growth, s phase, and mitosis continue in the absence of cell division, producing elongated, multinucleate cells. increased expression of spgp induces septum formation in g, s phase, and pre start g arrested cells. this requires the activity of cdcp kinase, but not p(cdc). increased expression of cdcp bypasses the requirement for spgp. spgp and cdcp can be coimmunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and interact in the two hybrid system. these data indicate that spgp is a key element in controlling the onset of septum formation in schizosaccharomyces pombe, and that it acts through the cdcp kinase.
