timing of apc/c substrate degradation is determined by fzy/fzr specificity of destruction boxes.. . the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c), activated by fzy and fzr, degrades cell cycle proteins that carry rxxl or ken destruction boxes (d boxes). apc/c substrates regulate sequential events and must be degraded in the correct order during mitosis and g(). we studied how d boxes determine apc/c(fzy)/apc/c(fzr) specificity and degradation timing. cyclin b has an rxxl box and is degraded by both apc/c(fzy) and apc/c(fzr); fzy has a ken box and is degraded by apc/c(fzr) only. we characterized the degradation of substrates with swapped d boxes. cyclin b with ken was degraded by apc/c(fzr) only. fzy with rxxl could be degraded by apc/c(fzy) and apc/c(fzr). interestingly, apc/c(fzy) but not apc/c(fzr) specific degradation is highly dependent on the location of rxxl. we studied degradation of tagged substrates in real time and observed that apc/c(fzr) is activated in early g(). these observations demonstrate how d box specificities of apc/c(fzy) and apc/c(fzr), and the successive activation of apc/c by fzy and fzr, establish the temporal degradation pattern. our observations can explain further why some endogenous rxxl substrates are degraded by apc/c(fzy), while others are restricted to apc/c(fzr).
