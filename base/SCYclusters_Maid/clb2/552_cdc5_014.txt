plk is a functional homolog of saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc, and elevated plk activity induces multiple septation structures.. . plk is a mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity peaks at the onset of m phase. it is closely related to other mammalian kinases, snk, fnk, and prk, as well as to xenopus laevis plx, drosophila melanogaster polo, schizosaccharomyces pombe plo, and saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc. the m phase of the cell cycle is a highly coordinated process which insures the equipartition of genetic and cellular materials during cell division. to enable understanding of the function of plk during m phase progression, various plk mutants were generated and expressed in sf cells and budding yeast. in vitro kinase assays with plk immunoprecipitates prepared from sf cells indicate that glu and thr play equally important roles for plk activity and that replacement of thr with a negatively charged residue elevates plk specific activity. ectopic expression of wild type plk (plk wt) complements the cell division defect associated with the cdc mutation in s. cerevisiae. the degree of complementation correlates closely with the plk activity measured in vitro, as it is enhanced by a mutationally activated plk, td, but is not observed with the inactive forms km, dn, and dr. in a cdc wild type background, expression of plk wt or td, but not of inactive forms, induced a sharp accumulation of cells in g. consistent with elevated plk activity, this phenomenon was enhanced by the c terminally deleted forms wt deltac and td deltac. expression of td also induced a class of cells with unusually elongated buds which developed multiple septal structures. this was not observed with the c terminally deleted form td deltac, however. it appears that the c terminus of plk is not required for the observed cell cycle influence but may be important for polarized cell growth and septal structure formation.
