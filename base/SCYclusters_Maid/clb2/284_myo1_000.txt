shep/dimp interacts with the motor domain of unconventional myosins in the budding yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . shep/dimp, a member of the unc /cro/shep (ucs) domain containing protein family, is required for endocytosis, polarization of actin cytoskeleton, and polarization of ash mrna in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we show herein that shep/dimp is involved in endocytosis and actin polarization through interactions with the type i myosins myop and myop. two hybrid and biochemical experiments showed that shep/dimp interacts with the motor domain of myo/p through its ucs domain. shep/dimp was required for myop localization to cortical patch like structures. using random mutagenesis of the motor region of myo, we identified four independent dominant point mutations that suppress the temperature sensitive growth phenotype of the she/dim null mutant. all of the amino acid substitutions caused by these mutations, vi, ni, ns, and km, could suppress the defects of endocytosis and actin polarization of the she/dim mutant as well. shep/dimp also showed two hybrid interactions with the motor domain of a type ii myosin myop and type v myosins myop and myop, and was required for proper localization of myop, which regulates polarization of ash mrna. our results suggest that shep/dimp is required for structural integrity or regulation of the motor domain of unconventional myosins.
