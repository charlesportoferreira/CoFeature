a cytosolic nad dependent deacetylase, hstp, can modulate nucleolar and telomeric silencing in yeast.. . in budding yeast, the silent information regulator sirp is a nuclear nad dependent deacetylase that is essential for both telomeric and rdna silencing. all eukaryotic species examined to date have multiple homologues of sir two (hsts), which share a highly conserved globular core domain. here we report that yeast hstp and a mammalian hstp homologue, hsirtp, are cytoplasmic in yeast and human cells, in contrast to yhstp and ysirp which are exclusively nuclear. although yhstp cannot restore silencing in a sir deletion, overexpression of yhstp influences nuclear silencing events in a sir strain, derepressing subtelomeric silencing while increasing repression in the rdna. in contrast, a form of ysirp carrying a point mutation in the conserved core domain disrupts both telomeric position effect (tpe) and rdna repression at low expression levels. this argues that non nuclear yhstp can compete for a substrate or ligand specifically required for telomeric, and not rdna repression.
