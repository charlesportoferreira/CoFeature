mixed segregation of chromosomes during single division meiosis of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . normal meiosis consists of two consecutive cell divisions in which all the chromosomes behave in a concerted manner. yeast cells homozygous for the mutation cdc, however, may be directed through a single meiotic division of a novel type. dyad analysis of a cdc/cdc strain with centromere linked markers on four different chromosomes has shown that, in these meioses, some chromosomes within a given cell segregate reductionally whereas others segregate equationally. the choice between the two types of segregation in these meioses is made individually by each chromosome pair. different chromosome pairs exhibit different segregation tendencies. similar results were obtained for cells homozygous for cdc.
