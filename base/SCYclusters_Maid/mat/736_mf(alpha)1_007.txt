expression and secretion of alpha amylase and glucoamylase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . alpha amylase genes of bacillus licheniformis and glucoamylase cdna of aspergillus niger were ligated to a e. coli yeast shuttle vector. the resultant plasmid was used to transform saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct starch degrading yeast strain. the results of enzyme activity assay and enzyme property analysis show that alpha amylase and glucoamylase genes have been expressed simultaneously in yeast under the control of promoters and terminators of yeast mf alpha factor and pgk genes and over % of enzyme activities were secreted to the medium. the engineered yeast strain hydrolyses % of the starch (%) in the medium after days. the recombinant plasmid exists stably in yeast.
