glycosyl phosphatidylinositol dependent cross linking of alpha agglutinin and beta , glucan in the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall.. . the cell adhesion protein alpha agglutinin is bound to the outer surface of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall and mediates cell cell contact in mating. alpha agglutinin is modified by addition of a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor as it traverses the secretory pathway. the presence of a gpi anchor is essential for cross linking into the wall, but the fatty acid and inositol components of the anchor are lost before cell wall association (lu, c. f., j. kurjan, and p. n. lipke, . a pathway for cell wall anchorage of saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha agglutinin. mol. cell. biol. . ). cell wall association of alpha agglutinin was accompanied by an increase in size and a gain in reactivity to antibodies directed against beta , glucan. several kre mutants, which have defects in synthesis of cell wall beta , glucan, had reduced molecular size of cell wall alpha agglutinin. these findings demonstrate that the cell wall form of alpha agglutinin is covalently associated with beta , glucan. the alpha agglutinin biosynthetic precursors did not react with antibody to beta , glucan, and the sizes of these forms were unaffected in kre mutants. a cooh terminal truncated form of alpha agglutinin, which is not gpi anchored and is secreted into the medium, did not react with the anti beta , glucan. we propose that extracellular cross linkage to beta , glucan mediates covalent association of alpha agglutinin with the cell wall in a manner that is dependent on prior addition of a gpi anchor to alpha agglutinin.
