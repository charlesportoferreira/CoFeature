purification of the inducible alpha agglutinin of s. cerevisiae and molecular cloning of the gene.. . the alpha agglutinin responsible for mating type specific agglutination of s. cerevisiae alpha cells has been purified to homogeneity. the glycoprotein released from the cell surface under mild conditions has a relative molecular mass of to kda as determined by sds gel electrophoresis. the protein moiety corresponds to . kda. with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the n terminal amino acid sequence, the alpha agglutinin gene has been cloned and sequenced. from the dna sequence, a protein of amino acids with potential n glycosylation sites is predicted. the carboxy terminal one third of the protein is not required for agglutination activity.
