o glycosylation as a sorting determinant for cell surface delivery in yeast.. . little is known about the mechanisms that determine localization of proteins to the plasma membrane in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the length of the transmembrane domains and association of proteins with lipid rafts have been proposed to play a role in sorting to the cell surface. here, we report that fusp, an o glycosylated integral membrane protein involved in cell fusion during yeast mating, requires o glycosylation for cell surface delivery. in cells lacking pmt, encoding a mannosyltransferase involved in the initial step of o glycosylation, fusp was not glycosylated and accumulated in late golgi structures. a chimeric protein lacking o glycosylation motif was missorted to the vacuole and accumulated in late golgi in wild type cells. exocytosis of this protein could be restored by addition of a amino acid portion of an o glycosylated sequence from fusp. our data suggest that o glycosylation functions as a sorting determinant for cell surface delivery of fusp.
