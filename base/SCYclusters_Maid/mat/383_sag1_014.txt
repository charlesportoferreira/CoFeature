a pathway for cell wall anchorage of saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha agglutinin.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha agglutinin is a cell wall anchored adhesion glycoprotein. the previously identified kda form, which contains a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor (d. wojciechowicz, c. f. lu, j. kurjan, and p. n. lipke, mol. cell. biol. . , ), and additional forms of , , to , and &gt; kda had the properties of intermediates in a transport and cell wall anchorage pathway. n glycosylation and additional modifications resulted in successive increases in size during transport. the and to kda forms were membrane associated and are likely to be intermediates between the kda form and a cell surface gpi anchored form of &gt; kda. a soluble form of &gt; kda that lacked the gpi anchor had properties of a periplasmic intermediate between the plasma membrane form and the &gt; kda cell wall anchored form. these results constitute experimental support for the hypothesis that gpi anchors act to localize alpha agglutinin to the plasma membrane and that cell wall anchorage involves release from the gpi anchor to produce a periplasmic intermediate followed by linkage to the cell wall.
