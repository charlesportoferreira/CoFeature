nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the conformation of membrane bound alpha mating factor. transferred nuclear overhauser effect analysis.. . the c h proton resonances of alpha mating factor, yeast pheromone, in ho solution were assigned. the phase transition temperature of perdeuterated dipalmitoylglycerophosphocholine (suspension) was found to be . degrees c. in the presence of vesicles of this phospholipid, the exchange broadening and transferred nuclear overhauser effect (trnoe) of peptide proton resonances (at degrees c) were analyzed. the mode of binding of this peptide with the phospholipid bilayer was elucidated. the n terminal nine residues (trp gly) are tightly bound to the bilayer, while the c terminal four residues (gln tyr) are left free in aqueous phase. this is consistent with the previous observation that the c terminal three residues (pro tyr) are not essential for the activity of this pheromone [masui, y. et al. () biochem. biophys. res. commun. , ]. furthermore, from the trnoe analyses, the conformation of the membrane bound n terminal part of alpha mating factor was elucidated; the residues trp gln form a compact helical structure while the residues lys gly form an extended structure. a similar trnoe was also observed for an active decapeptide analog trp gln. this confirms the previous conclusion that the physiological activities of this pheromone and analog peptides are correlated with the conformations of membrane bound peptide molecules [higashijima, t. et al. () febs lett. , ].
