ubiquitin independent entry into the yeast recycling pathway.. . the yeast a factor receptor (step) is subject to two mechanistically distinct modes of endocytosis. a constitutive, ligand independent pathway links to vacuolar degradation of the receptor, while a ligand dependent uptake pathway links primarily to recycling and thus, receptor reutilization. step ubiquitination triggers its uptake into the constitutive pathway. the present work considers the role of the receptor ubiquitination associated with the step ligand dependent endocytosis mechanism. the doadelta mutation which reduces the cellular availability of ubiquitin blocks the step constitutive uptake. uptake into the step ligand dependent recycling pathway, however, continues unimpaired. the ubiquitin independence of step ligand dependent uptake was further indicated by analysis of receptor mutants having lys to arg substitutions at all possible ubiquitin acceptor sites. again, the ligand induced internalization was unimpaired. furthermore, no discernible effect was seen on either recycling or on the slow pep dependent turnover of the receptor (for receptor internalized via the ligand dependent mechanism, trafficking to the vacuole/lysosome is the minor, alternate fate to recycling). however, one striking effect of the lys to arg mutations was noted. following a prolonged exposure of the cells to the a factor ligand, rather than being delivered to the vacuolar lumen, the lys to arg receptor was found to localize instead to the limiting membrane of the vacuole. thus, while receptor ubiquitination clearly is not required for either the a factor dependent uptake into recycling pathway or for the recycling itself, it does affect the routing of receptor to the vacuole, likely by affecting the routing through the late endosomal, multivesicular body. ubiquitinated receptor may be selected into the internal, lumenal vesicles, while unmodified receptor may be left to reside at the limiting external membrane.
