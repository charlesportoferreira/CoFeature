structural requirements for alpha mating factor activity.. . the sexual hormone of s. cerevisiae, alpha mating factor (alpha mf, whwlqlkpgqpmy) has structural homology with mammalian luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (lhrh, pehwsyglrpg nh) and has been shown to exhibit lhrh activity [loumaye et al. () science , ]. we have tested whether lhrh has alpha mf activity in yeast and found that it does not. we therefore synthesized a series of hybrid peptides of alpha mf and lhrh to study the structural features which determine alpha mf and lhrh activities. a hybrid peptide consisting of the lhrh sequence with the c terminal tetrapeptide (qpmy) of alpha mf did not exhibit alpha mf activity. thus, the lack of alpha mf activity of lhrh is not due solely to the absence of the c terminal residues. substitution of lys in alpha mf with arg, as is found in lhrh, did not affect the alpha mf activity, nor did an additional substitution of trp with pglu. however, the c terminal four amino acids of alpha mf were necessary for alpha mf activity. our results indicate that insertion of a ser residue in position as found in lhrh abolishes alpha mf activity. these results suggest that, in addition to an intact c terminus, correct spacing of the n terminal his and the c terminus is required for alpha mf activity. the hybrid peptides all exhibited less lhrh activity than either lhrh or alpha mf. these structure function studies indicate that the structural homology between these two reproductive hormones may not reflect an evolutionary relationship between them.
