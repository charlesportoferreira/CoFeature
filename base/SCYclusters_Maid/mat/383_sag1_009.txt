expression of the candida albicans gene als in saccharomyces cerevisiae induces adherence to endothelial and epithelial cells.. . to identify genes encoding adhesins that mediate the binding of candida albicans to endothelial cells, a genomic library from this organism was constructed and used to transform saccharomyces cerevisiae. these transformed organisms were screened for adherence to endothelial cells, and a highly adherent clone was identified. the adherence of this clone to endothelial cells was over fold greater than that of control s. cerevisiae transformed with the empty plasmid. this clone also exhibited enhanced adherence to epithelial cells. the c. albicans gene contained within this clone was found to be als. these results indicate that als may encode a candidal adhesin.
