agglutination and mating activity of the mf alpha encoded alpha factor analog in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the mf alpha encoded asn ,arg alpha factor like peptide has been shown shown to have similar activity to gln ,lys alpha factor in morphogenesis and growth arrest studies (s. raths, p. shenbagamurthi, f. naider, and j. m. becker, j. bacteriol. . , ). we tested the asn ,arg peptide in agglutination and mating assays and found that its activity was similar to or slightly less than that of the gln ,lys alpha factor. the asn ,arg alpha factor like peptide is thus the most active analog of the gln ,lys alpha factor known.
