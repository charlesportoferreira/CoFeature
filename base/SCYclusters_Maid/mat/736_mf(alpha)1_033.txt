synthesis, secretion and processing of alpha factor interferon fusion proteins in yeast.. . a gene fusion consisting of base pairs of ' flanking region of the yeast mf alpha gene, base pairs coding for alpha factor prepro sequence, and a modified human ifn alpha gene was constructed. mat alpha cells containing the chimeric gene synthesized and secreted active ifn alpha into the growth medium. the secreted interferon molecules contained the last amino acids of alpha factor prepro sequence and the amino acids encoded by the dna modifications introduced at the beginning of ifn alpha gene. dna sequences coding for these amino acids were removed by oligonucleotide directed in vitro mutagenesis. yeast cells transformed with expression plasmids containing the altered junction synthesized and secreted human ifn alpha with the natural nh terminus.
