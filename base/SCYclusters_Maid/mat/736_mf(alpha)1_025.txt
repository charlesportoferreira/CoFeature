secretion and glycosylation of clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase a encoded by the cela gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the clostridium thermocellum cela gene encoding endoglucanase a is expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae but the enzyme produced from the native cela gene is not secreted. after removal of the bacterial signal peptide coding sequence, the gene was fused to the promoter and prepro segment of the s. cerevisiae mf alpha gene. this construction directs secretion of active endoglucanase a into the culture medium when introduced in yeast on either replicating or integrating vectors. secretion of endoglucanase a required growth of transformants on rich medium. the secreted enzyme is a , da glycoprotein containing about half of its molecular weight as carbohydrate. this new gene fusion could facilitate further research on protein secretion in yeast by using a cellulase as a marker enzyme.
