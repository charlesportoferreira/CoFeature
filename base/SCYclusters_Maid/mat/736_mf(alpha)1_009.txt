efficient intra and extracellular production of human beta , galactosyltransferase in saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by yeast secretion leaders.. . we have compared the function of homologous and heterologous secretion leaders to mediate production of human beta , galactosyltransferase (gal tf) in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. although all genes encoding leader/gal tf fusions were transcribed by strong yeast promoters, only low production levels were obtained for full length gal tf containing the human membrane anchor region. in contrast, a gene fusion encoding the membrane anchor region of the yeast alpha , mannosyltransferase (mnt) fused to soluble gal tf yielded high mrna and intracellular protein levels. gal tf could also be produced extracellularly using a fusion of the pre pro region of the yeast mf alpha precursor (mf alpha ) to soluble gal tf; a fusion containing only the pre region of mf alpha was synthesized intracellularly, but did not lead to gal tf activity in the culture medium. all yeast produced gal tf proteins were enzymatically active. these results demonstrate that yeast secretion leaders are advantageous to achieve efficient production of active gal tf in s. cerevisiae.
