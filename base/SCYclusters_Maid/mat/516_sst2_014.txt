control of adaptation to mating pheromone by g protein beta subunits of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the ste gene of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the beta subunit of a heterotrimeric g protein that mediates response to mating pheromones and influences recovery from pheromone induced growth arrest. to explore how g beta subunits regulate response and recovery (adaptation), we isolated and characterized signaling defective ste alleles (stesd). stesd mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions in the n terminal region of step, proximal to the first of seven repeat units conserved in g protein beta subunits. genetic tests indicated that stesd mutations disrupted functions of step required for inducing pheromone responses. wild type cells that overexpressed stesd alleles displayed apparently normal initial responses to pheromone as judged by quantitative mating, g arrest and transcriptional assays. however, after undergoing initial g arrest, wild type cells overexpressing stesd alleles recovered more quickly from division arrest, suggestive of a hyperadaptive phenotype. because hyperadaptation occurred when stesd alleles were overexpressed in cells lacking sstp (barp), sstp or the c terminal domain of the alpha factor receptor, this phenotype did not involve three principal modes of adaptation in yeast. however, hyperadaptation was abolished when stesd mutations were combined in cis with a deletion that removes a segment of step (residues ) previously implicated in adaptation to pheromone. these results indicate that g beta subunits possess two independent activities, one required for triggering pheromone response and another that promotes adaptation. potential models for g beta subunit mediated adaptation are discussed.
