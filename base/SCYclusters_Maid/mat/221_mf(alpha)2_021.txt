saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two discrete genes coding for the alpha factor pheromone.. . two genes, mf alpha and mf alpha , coding for the alpha factor in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified by in situ colony hybridization of synthetic probes to a yeast genomic library. the probes were designed on the basis of the known amino acid sequence of the tridecapeptide alpha pheromone. the nucleotide sequence revealed that the two genes, though similar in their overall structure, differ from each other in several striking ways. mf alpha gene contains copies of the coding sequence for the alpha factor, which are separated by nucleotides encoding the octapeptide lys arg glu ala glu(or asp) ala glu ala. the first alpha factor coding block is preceded by a sequence for the hexapeptide lys arg glu ala and additional amino acids. mf alpha gene contains coding sequences for two copies of the alpha factor that differ from each other and from alpha factor encoded by mf alpha gene by a gln leads to asn and a lys leads to arg substitution. the first copy of the alpha factor is preceded by a sequence coding for amino acids which ends with lys arg glu ala val ala asp ala. the coding blocks of the two copies of the pheromone are separated by the sequence for lys arg glu ala asn ala asp ala. thus, the alpha factor can be derived from different precursor proteins of and amino acids containing, respectively, and copies of the pheromone.
