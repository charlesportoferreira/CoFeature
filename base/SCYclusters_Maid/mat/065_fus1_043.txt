novel antagonist to agonist switch in chimeric g protein coupled alpha factor peptide receptors.. . the alpha factor analog destrp,ala alpha factor (dta alpha factor) acts as an antagonist for both the s. cerevisiae alpha factor receptor (c alpha fr) and the s. kluyveri alpha factor receptor (k alpha fr). chimeric alpha factor receptors in which a portion (residues ) of the seven hydrophobic segments were derived from the k alpha fr and the rest from c alpha fr conferred potent activation of cellular responses by dta alpha factor including induction of fus expression without significantly affecting binding. chimeric receptors with all hydrophobic segments derived from one receptor did not express sensitivity. we propose that dta alpha factor represents an antagonist that that has an activation energy barrier to activating c alpha fr and k alpha fr but which retains a latent potential to act as an agonist.
