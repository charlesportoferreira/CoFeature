role for the rho family gtpase cdc in yeast mating pheromone signal pathway.. . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the process of conjugation of haploid cells of genotype mata and mat alpha to form mata/alpha diploids is triggered by pheromones produced by each mating type. these pheromones stimulate a cellular response by interaction with receptors linked to a heterotrimeric g protein. although genetic analysis indicates that the pheromone signal is transmitted through the g beta gamma dimer, the initial target(s) of g protein activation remain to be determined. temperature sensitive cells with mutations of the cdc and cdc genes, which are incapable of budding and of generating cell polarity at the restrictive temperature, are also unable to mate. cdc acts as a guanylyl nucleotide exchange factor for the rho type gtpase cdc, which has been shown to be a fundamental component of the molecular machinery controlling morphogenesis in eukaryotic cells. therefore, the inability of cdc and cdc mutants to mate has been presumed to be due to a requirement for generation of cell polarity and related morphogenetic events during conjugation. but here we show that cdc has a direct signalling role in the mating pheromone response between the g protein and the downstream protein kinase cascade.
