homolog of a factor receptor gene in saccharomyces exiguus.. . homologs of saccharomyces cerevisiae ste, a factor receptor gene were detected from s. exiguus nfri by low stringency southern hybridization. this strain might have at least two types of homolog. one of these homologs, designated as e ste was cloned. its nucleotide sequence revealed % identity to ste. the putative protein coding region consisted of amino acid residues. the amino acid sequence identity between ste and e ste was % and that of the n terminal amino acid residues considered to be the pheromone binding domain was %.
