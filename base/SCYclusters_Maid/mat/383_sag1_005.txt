ag alpha is the structural gene for the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha agglutinin, a cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell cell interactions during mating.. . we have cloned the alpha agglutinin structural gene, ag alpha , by the isolation of alpha specific agglutination defective mutants, followed by isolation of a complementing plasmid. independently isolated alpha specific agglutination defective mutations were in a single complementation group, consistent with biochemical results indicating that the alpha agglutinin is composed of a single polypeptide. mapping results suggested that the complementation group identified by these mutants is allelic to the ag alpha mutation identified previously. expression of ag alpha rna was alpha specific and inducible by a factor. sequences similar to the consensus sequences for positive control by mat alpha and pheromone induction were found upstream of the ag alpha initiation codon. the ag alpha gene could encode a amino acid protein with a putative signal sequence, possible n glycosylation sites, and a high proportion of serine and threonine residues, all of which are features expected for the alpha agglutinin sequence. disruption of the ag alpha gene resulted in failure to express alpha agglutinin and loss of cellular agglutinability in alpha cells. an escherichia coli fusion protein containing amino acids of the ag alpha sequence was recognized by an anti alpha agglutinin antibody. in addition, the ability of this antibody to inhibit agglutination was prevented by this fusion protein. these results indicate that ag alpha encodes alpha agglutinin. features of the ag alpha gene product suggest that the amino terminal half of the protein contains the a agglutinin binding domain and that the carboxy terminal half contains a cell surface localization domain, possibly including a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor.
