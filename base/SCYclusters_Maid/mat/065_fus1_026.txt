chs, a gene involved in chitin synthesis and mating in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the chs locus of saccharomyces cerevisiae is important for wild type levels of chitin synthase iii activity. chs cells have reduced levels of this activity. to further understand the role of chs in yeast, the chs gene was cloned by complementation of the calcofluor resistance phenotype of a chs mutant. transformation of the mutant with a plasmid carrying chs restored calcofluor sensitivity, wild type cell wall chitin levels, and chitin synthase iii activity levels. dna sequence analysis reveals that chs encodes a unique polypeptide of amino acids with a molecular mass of , da. the predicted sequence shows a heptapeptide repeated times, a carboxy terminal lysine rich tail, and some similarity to neurofilament proteins. the effects of deletion of chs indicate that it is not essential for yeast cell growth; however, it is important for mating. deletion of chs, the presumptive structural gene for chitin synthase iii activity, results in a modest decrease in mating efficiency, whereas chsdelta cells exhibit a much stronger mating defect. however, chs cells produce more chitin than chs mutants, indicating that chs plays a role in other processes besides chitin synthesis. analysis of mating mixtures of chs cells reveals that cells agglutinate and make contact but fail to undergo cell fusion. the chs mating defect can be partially rescued by fus and/or fus, two genes which have been implicated previously in cell fusion, but not by fus. in addition, mating efficiency is much lower in fus fus x chs than in fus fus x wild type crosses. our results indicate that chsp plays an important role in the cell fusion step of mating.
