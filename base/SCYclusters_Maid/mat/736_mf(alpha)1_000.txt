position one analogs of the saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide pheromone.. . analogs of the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha mating factor [whwlqlkpgqpmy], in which a variety of residues replaced trp were synthesized and assayed for biological activity and receptor affinity. analogs containing gly or leu or many different aromatic residues in position of the peptide exhibited bioactivity in a growth arrest assay slightly greater than, or equal to, that of the parent pheromone, whereas the glu and lys analogs exhibited significantly lower bioactivity. analogs with an aromatic replacement at position had to fold lower receptor affinity than the parent peptide, whereas analogs with a hydrophilic residue at the n terminus exhibited large reductions in receptor affinity with the peptide with glu in position showing a fold reduction. n alpha acetylation had little effect on bioactivity but lowered receptor affinity by to fold. amidation of the carboxyl terminus resulted in a fold decrease in activity and a fold decrease in receptor affinity. these results indicate that the alpha factor receptor has a large hydrophobic binding pocket, possibly containing a negatively charged side chain, which interacts with the n terminus of alpha factor. the lack of correlation between activity and binding and several analogs suggests that small residues near the n terminus of alpha factor may be very efficient in triggering isomerization of the receptor to its activated state in the first step of the signal transduction pathway.
