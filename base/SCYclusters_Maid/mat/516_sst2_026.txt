isolation and genetic analysis of saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants supersensitive to g arrest by a factor and alpha factor pheromones.. . eight independently isolated mutants which are supersensitive (sst ) to the g arrest induced by the tridecapeptide pheromone alpha factor were identified by screening mutagenized saccharomyces cerevisiae mata cells on solid medium for increased growth inhibition by alpha factor. these mutants carried lesions in two complementation groups, sst and sst. mutations at the sst locus were mating type specific. mata sst cells were supersensitive to alpha factor, but mat alpha sst cells were not supersensitive to a factor. in contrast, mutations at the sst locus conferred supersensitivity to the pheromones of the opposite mating type on both mata and mat alpha cells. even in the absence of added alpha pheromone, about % of the cells in exponentially growing cultures of mata strains carrying any of three different alleles of sst (including the ochre mutation sst ) had the aberrant morphology (&quot;shmoo&quot; shape) that normally develops only after mata cells are exposed to alpha factor. this &quot;self shmooing&quot; phenotype was genetically linked to the sst mutations, although the leakiest allele isolated (sst ) did not display this characteristic. normal mata/mat alpha diploids do not respond to pheromones; diploids homozygous for an sst mutation (mata/mat alpha sst /sst ) were still insensitive to alpha factor. the sst gene was mapped to within . centimorgans of his on chromosome ix. the sst gene was unlinked to sst, was not centromere linked, and was shown to be neither linked to nor centromere distal to mat on the right arm of chromosome iii.
