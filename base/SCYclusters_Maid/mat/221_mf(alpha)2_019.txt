different structure function relationships for alpha factor induced morphogenesis and agglutination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . eight synthetic analogs of the mating pheromone alpha factor induced morphogenesis and increased agglutinability in a cells. most analogs induced increased agglutinability at lower concentrations than those at which they induced morphogenesis, but the ratio of the potencies for the two effects varied fold among different analogs. morphological response to pheromone required exposure for at least min, but increased agglutinability followed exposures of s. two synthetic analogs induced neither response. in competition experiments, both of these analogs prevented induction of increased agglutinability and morphogenesis by active alpha factor. the inactive peptides blocked increased agglutinability at lower concentrations than those at which they blocked morphogenesis. alpha factors exhibited different structure function relationships for morphogenesis as compared with agglutinability. thus, response of saccharomyces cerevisiae to alpha factor is complex and may be mediated by more than one receptor.
