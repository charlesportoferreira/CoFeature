alpha factor structural gene mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae. effects on alpha factor production and mating.. . the role of alpha factor structural genes mf alpha and mf alpha in alpha factor production and mating has been investigated by the construction of mf alpha and mf alpha mutations that totally eliminate gene function. an mf alpha mutant in which the entire coding region is deleted shows a considerable decrease in alpha factor production and a % decrease in mating. mutations in mf alpha have little or no effect on alpha factor production or mating. the mf alpha mf alpha double mutants are completely defective in mating and alpha factor production. these results indicate that at least one alpha factor structural gene product is required for mating in mat alpha cells, that mf alpha is responsible for the majority of alpha factor production, and that mf alpha and mf alpha are the only active alpha factor genes.
