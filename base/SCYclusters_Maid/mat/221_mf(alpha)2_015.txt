biological activity and conformational isomerism in position analogues of the des tryptophan, beta cyclohexylalanine alpha factor from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . analogues of the des tryptophan, beta cyclohexylalanine alpha factor of saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the glycyl residue of position was replaced by d ala, l ala, d leu, and l leu, were synthesized and evaluated by morphogenesis assays and circular dichroism spectroscopy. synthesis was accomplished in solution phase with mixed anhydrides and p nitrophenyl active esters as the coupling agents. all crude dodecapeptides were purified to greater than % homogeneity by preparative high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed phase column. the gly, d ala, and d leu analogues elicited morphogenic alterations in mata strains of s. cerevisiae at concentrations of micrograms/ml and exhibited similar cd patterns in both trifluoroethanol and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer, ph .. in contrast, the l ala and l leu analogues were more than times less active in the morphogenesis assay and had markedly different cd spectra. these results demonstrate that the position residue plays an important role in determining the biological activity and solution conformation of alpha factor. we suggest the presence of a type ii beta turn in the lys gln region when the alpha factor assumes its biologically active conformation.
