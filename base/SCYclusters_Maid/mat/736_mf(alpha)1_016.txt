a new signal peptide useful for secretion of heterologous proteins from yeast and its application for synthesis of hirudin.. . the bgl gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a beta glucanase which is localized to the yeast cell wall. the ability of a amino acid (aa) signal peptide derived from the bgl gene to direct a heterologous protein to the secretory pathway of yeast has been compared to that of the mf alpha encoded signal peptide in a series of gene fusions. as a model protein, the leech anticoagulant, recombinant hirudin variant lys (hir) has been studied. from a multicopy plasmid chimaeric proteins were produced which carry the bgl signal peptide (or the artificial bgl pre val variant) (i) in front of the mf alpha pro sequence (or modified versions of mf alpha pro), i.e., a prepro signal, or (ii) joined directly to the heterologous protein. accumulation of active hir in yeast culture supernatants was observed when the bgl (or the bgl pre val) signal peptide were used in combination with either of three versions of the mf alpha pro peptide. the authentic mf alpha pro, a partially deleted mf alpha pro delta , or a pro bearing an aa change (mf alpha pro gly). in each case the bgl signal peptide (or its variant) has proven equally productive to the corresponding mf alpha peptide. four times more active hir was detected in the culture supernatant when either signal peptide was fused directly to the recombinant protein, as compared to a prepro protein version. correct signal peptide cleavage was obtained when hir was produced as a bgl pre val.fusion protein.
