enhanced secretion of human nerve growth factor from saccharomyces cerevisiae using an advanced delta integration system.. . we have designed an advanced delta integration system (integration of genes into the delta sequence of yeast retrotransposon ty) and used it for secretion of human nerve growth factor (hngf) from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the expression and secretion of hngf was directed by the pgk promoter and mf alpha prepro signal. using two selectable markers (ura and leu d), haploid yeast strains were constructed with approximately copies of a delta integrated hngf expression cassette on four chromosomes. the strain secreted hngf at levels fold higher than a micron based plasmid. northern and western analyses revealed that the oversecretion was caused by an increased amount of mrna. we also detected an unusual processing of the mf alpha prepro hngf fusion protein that required the pep mutation. application of this system for industrial purposes is discussed.
