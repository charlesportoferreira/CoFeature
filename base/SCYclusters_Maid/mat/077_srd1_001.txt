srd, a saccharomyces cerevisiae suppressor of the temperature sensitive pre rrna processing defect of rrp .. . we define a new gene, srd, involved in the processing of pre rrna to mature rrna. the srd gene was identified by selecting for second site suppressors of the previously described rrp mutation. the rrp mutation causes temperature sensitive growth, a conditional defect in processing of s pre rrna to mature s rrna, and a nonconditional increase in sensitivity to several aminoglycoside antibiotics. all srd alleles identified are recessive and apparently specific to the rrp mutation. although a mutation of srd suppresses the pre rrna processing defect, drug sensitivity and thermolethality of a point mutation of rrp, it is unable to suppress a rrp disruption allele. we suggest that the srd gene product either interacts with or regulates the rrp product.
