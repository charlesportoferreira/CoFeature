structure activity relationships in the dodecapeptide alpha factor of saccharomyces cerevisiae. position analogues are poor inducers of agglutinability.. . five des trp,cha,x analogues of alpha factor, where x = ala, val, ile, nle, or d leu and x = leu in the natural alpha factor sequence, were prepared by solution phase techniques utilizing isobutyl chloroformate or hydroxybenzotriazole accelerated active esters as the coupling agents. purification to % or greater homogeneity was accomplished by high performance liquid chromatography on a reversed phase mubondapak c column with methanol/water/trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase. three of the synthesized analogues (x = val, ile, nle) induced morphogenesis and increased agglutinability in a cells. these substitutions demonstrate that a gamma branched side chain at position is not essential for biological activity. all of the active analogues induced morphogenesis at lower concentrations than they induced enhanced agglutinability. these results and other structure activity relationships [baffi, r. a., shenbagamurthi, p., terrance, k., becker, j. m., naider, f., &amp; lipke, p. () j. bacteriol. , ] indicate that the agglutination and morphological responses to alpha factor can be varied independently. replacement of leu with ala or d leu resulted in inactive analogues that were not antagonistic for alpha factor activity. cell mediated hydrolysis experiments indicated that the biological activities of the alpha factor analogues are independent of their rates of degradation. all position analogues were hydrolyzed more slowly than the parent compound, suggesting that the enzyme which degrades alpha factor is highly specific for the native structure.
