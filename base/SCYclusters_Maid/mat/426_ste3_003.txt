localization and signaling of g(beta) subunit step are controlled by a factor receptor and the a specific protein asgp.. . haploid yeast cells initiate pheromone signaling upon the binding of pheromone to its receptor and activation of the coupled g protein. a regulatory process termed receptor inhibition blocks pheromone signaling when the a factor receptor is inappropriately expressed in mata cells. receptor inhibition blocks signaling by inhibiting the activity of the g protein beta subunit, step. to investigate how step activity is inhibited, its subcellular location was examined. in wild type cells, alpha factor treatment resulted in localization of step to the plasma membrane of mating projections. in cells expressing the a factor receptor, alpha factor treatment resulted in localization of step away from the plasma membrane to an internal compartment. an altered version of step that is largely insensitive to receptor inhibition retained its association with the membrane in cells expressing the a factor receptor. the inhibitory function of the a factor receptor required asg, an a specific gene of previously unknown function. asg rna was induced by pheromone, consistent with increased inhibition as the pheromone response progresses. the a factor receptor inhibited signaling in its liganded state, demonstrating that the receptor can block the signal that it initiates. asg was required for the altered localization of step that occurs during receptor inhibition, and the subcellular location of asgp was consistent with its having a direct effect on step localization. these results demonstrate that asgp mediates a regulatory process that blocks signaling from a g protein beta subunit and causes its relocalization within the cell.
