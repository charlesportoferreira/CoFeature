the aga product is involved in cell surface attachment of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell adhesion glycoprotein a agglutinin.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae a and alpha cells express the complementary cell surface glycoproteins a agglutinin and alpha agglutinin, respectively, which interact with one another to promote cellular aggregation during mating. treatment of s. cerevisiae a cells with reducing agents releases the binding subunit of a agglutinin, which has been purified and characterized; little biochemical information on the overall structure of a agglutinin is available. to characterise a agglutinin structure and function, we have used a genetic approach to clone an a agglutinin structural gene (agai). mutants with a specific agglutination defects were isolated, the majority of which fell into a single complementation group, called aga. the aga mutants showed wild type pheromone production and response, efficient mating on solid medium, and a mating defect in liquid medium; these phenotypes are characteristic of agglutinin mutants. the aga gene was cloned by complementation; the gene sequence indicated that it could encode a protein of amino acids with high serine and threonine content, a putative n terminal signal sequence, and a c terminal hydrophobic sequence similar to signals for the attachment to glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchors. active a agglutinin binding subunit is secreted by aga mutants, indicating that aga is involved in cells surface attachment of a agglutinin. this result suggests that aga encodes a protein with functional similarity to the core subunits of a agglutinin analogs from other budding yeasts. unexpectedly, the aga transcript was expressed and induced by pheromone in both a and alpha cells, suggesting that the a specific expression of active a agglutinin results only from a specific regulation of the a agglutinin binding subunit.
