two regulators of step inhibit pheromone responsive transcription by separate mechanisms.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor step is responsible for activating genes in response to map kinase cascades controlling mating and filamentous growth. step is negatively regulated by two inhibitor proteins, digp (also called rstp) and digp (also called rstp). the expression of a c terminal step fragment (residues to ) [step( )] from a gal promoter causes fus induction in a strain expressing wild type ste, suggesting that this region can cause the activation of endogenous step. residues to are sufficient to cause ste dependent fus induction when overexpressed, and this region of step was found to bind digp but not digp in yeast extracts. in contrast, recombinant glutathione s transferase digp binds to the step dna binding domain (dbd). expression of dig, but not dig, from a gal promoter inhibits transcriptional activation by an step dbd vp fusion. furthermore, disruption of dig, but not dig, causes elevated transcriptional activation by a lexa step( ) fusion. step has multiple regions within the c terminus (flanking residue ) that can promote multimerization in vitro, and we demonstrate that these interactions can contribute to the activation of endogenous step by overproduced c terminal fragments. these results demonstrate that digp and digp do not function by redundant mechanisms but rather inhibit pheromone responsive transcription through interactions with separate regions of step.
