pheromone signalling in saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the small gtp binding protein cdcp and its activator cdc.. . pheromone signalling in saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by the ste ste g protein beta gamma subunits. a possible target for the subunits is step, whose structural homolog, the serine/threonine kinase pak, is activated by gtp binding ps cdc and rac. the putative cdcp binding domain of step, expressed as a fusion protein, binds human and yeast gtp binding cdcp. cdcp is required for alpha factor induced activation of fus.cdcts strains defective for cdcp gdp/gtp exchange show no pheromone induction at restrictive temperatures but are partially rescued by overexpression of cdcp, which is potentiated by cdcpv mutants. epistatic analysis indicates that cdc and cdc lie between ste and ste in the pathway. the two hybrid system revealed that step interacts with cdcp. we propose that cdcp plays a pivotal role both in polarization of the cytoskeleton and in pheromone signalling.
