a covalently constrained congener of the saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide mating pheromone is an agonist.. . an analog of alpha factor, the saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide mating pheromone (trp his trp leu gln leu lys pro gly gln pro met tyr), in which the side chains of lys and gln were covalently linked, was synthesized using solid phase methodologies. the yield of the purified cyclic analog cyclo,[nle]alpha factor was %, and its structure was verified by amino acid analysis, peptide sequencing, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. cyclo,[nle]alpha factor caused growth arrest and morphological alterations in s. cerevisiae mata cells qualitatively identical to those induced by linear pheromone and was one fourth to one twentieth as active as the linear alpha factor depending upon the s. cerevisiae strain tested. consistent with the relative activities of the linear and cyclic peptides, binding competition studies indicated that cyclo,[nle]alpha factor had approximately fold less affinity for the alpha factor receptor. hydrolysis of the cyclic peptide by the target cells did not lead to opening of the ring and was less rapid than that of linear alpha factor. the alpha factor antagonist des trp [ala,nle]alpha factor reversed the activity of the cyclic analog, and cyclo,[nle]alpha factor was not active at the restrictive temperature in a temperature sensitive receptor mutant. these results support the conclusion that the cyclic alpha factor occupies the same binding site within the receptor as is occupied by the natural pheromone. the cyclic alpha factor represents a rare example of an agonist among covalently constrained congeners of small linear peptide messengers.
