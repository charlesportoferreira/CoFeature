essential role for induced ca+ influx followed by [ca+]i rise in maintaining viability of yeast cells late in the mating pheromone response pathway. a study of [ca+]i in single saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with imaging of fura .. . we established an experimental system for measuring the cytosolic free ca+ concentration ([ca+]i) in individual saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using fura as a ca(+) specific probe in conjunction with digital image processing and examined changes in [ca+]i in response to alpha factor in single cells of a mating type. the addition of alpha factor to a cells raised [ca+]i to several hundred nanomolar in the cells from a basal level of approximately nm, simultaneous with the induction of ca+ influx. when the cells were incubated with alpha factor in a ca(+) deficient medium, ca+ influx was greatly reduced, and the rise in [ca+]i was not detected. this indicates that the alpha factor induced rise in [ca+]i is generated by ca+ influx through the plasma membrane and not by release from internal stores. in the ca(+) deficient medium, a cells died specifically after they had changed into cells with one projection on the cell surface. this indicates that the rise in [ca+]i is essential for the late response to alpha factor. the duration of ca+ requirement for maintaining viability was limited to this stage, and the earlier and later stages were not affected by ca+ deprivation. mating between a and alpha mating type cells was impaired in this medium due to cell death at and before the stage of conjugation. these findings are the first evidence for an essential role for mobilized ca+ in the yeast life cycle.
