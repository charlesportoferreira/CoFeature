an alpha specific gene, sag is required for sexual agglutination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . seven alpha specific mutants specifically defective in sexual agglutinability were isolated. the other alpha mating functions exhibited by these mutants, designated sag mutants, such as the production of alpha pheromone and response to a mating pheromone, were normal. while the mat alpha sag cells did not agglutinate with wild type a cells, the mata sag cells did, indicating that the sag gene is expressed only in alpha cells. the mutations were semi dominant and fell into a single complementation group, sag, which was mapped near met on chromosome x. complementation analysis showed that sag and ag alpha , the latter being a previously reported alpha specific mutation, were mutations in the same gene.
