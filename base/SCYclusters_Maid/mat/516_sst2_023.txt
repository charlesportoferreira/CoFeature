identifying mutations in duplicated functions in saccharomyces cerevisiae. recessive mutations in hmg coa reductase genes.. . the two yeast genes for hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg coa) reductase, hmg and hmg, each encode a functional isozyme. although cells bearing null mutations in both genes are inviable, cells bearing a null mutation in either gene are viable. this paper describes a method of screening for recessive mutations in the hmg gene, the gene encoding the majority of hmg coa reductase activity in the cell. this method should be applicable to the isolation of mutations in other recovered in hmg. these mutations exhibited intragenic complementation. one allele is in one complementation group and three alleles are in a second complementation group. assays of hmg coa reductase activity indicated that the point mutations destroy most if not all of the activity encoded by hmg. intragenic complementation occurred with partial restoration of enzymatic activity. hmg was mapped to the left arm of chromosome xiii near sup, and hmg was mapped to the right arm of chromosome xii near sst. a slight deleterious effect of a null mutation in either hmg coa reductase gene was detected by a co cultivation experiment involving the wild type strain and the two single mutants.
