vps controls vacuolar and endocytic traffic through a prevacuolar compartment in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . newly synthesized vacuolar hydrolases such as carboxypeptidase y (cpy) are sorted from the secretory pathway in the late golgi compartment and reach the vacuole after a distinct set of membrane trafficking steps. endocytosed proteins are also delivered to the vacuole. it has been proposed that these pathways converge at a &quot;prevacuolar&quot; step before delivery to the vacuole. one group of genes has been described that appears to control both of these pathways. cells carrying mutations in any one of the class e vps (vacuolar protein sorting) genes accumulate vacuolar, golgi, and endocytosed proteins in a novel compartment adjacent to the vacuole termed the &quot;class e&quot; compartment, which may represent an exaggerated version of the physiological prevacuolar compartment. we have characterized one of the class e vps genes, vps, in detail to address this question. using a temperature sensitive allele of vps, we find that upon rapid inactivation of vpsp function, the golgi protein vpsp (the cpy sorting receptor) and endocytosed step rapidly accumulate in a class e compartment. upon restoration of vpsp function, the vpsp that had accumulated in the class e compartment could return to the golgi apparatus and restore correct sorting of cpy. likewise, step that had accumulated in the class e compartment en route to the vacuole could progress to the vacuole upon restoration of vpsp function indicating that the class e compartment can act as a functional intermediate. because both recycling golgi proteins and endocytosed proteins rapidly accumulate in a class e compartment upon inactivation of vpsp, we propose that vpsp controls membrane traffic through the prevacuolar/endosomal compartment in wild type cells.
