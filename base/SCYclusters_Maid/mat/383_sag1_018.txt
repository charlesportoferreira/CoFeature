interaction of alpha agglutinin with saccharomyces cerevisiae a cells.. . binding of saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha agglutinin to target a cells was assayed by agglutination inhibition and i alpha agglutinin binding. the assays showed characteristics of equilibrium binding, namely saturability, competability, and the establishment of a kinetic endpoint in the presence of free alpha agglutinin and free receptor. the binding was heterogeneous, displaying strong binding (() liters/mol) and a weaker interaction. there were about x () strong binding sites per a cell. denaturing gels displayed identical labeled species binding to the a cells in the weak and strong interactions. furthermore, weakly bound material could subsequently bind tightly to fresh a cells, implying that the same species of alpha agglutinin was bound in the two states.
