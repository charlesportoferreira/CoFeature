structure activity relationships in the dodecapeptide alpha factor of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . ten analogues of his trp leu gln leu lys pro gly gln pro met tyr, the dodecapeptide alpha factor of saccharomyces cerevisiae, were synthesized by conventional solution phase techniques and purified by using high performance liquid chromatography. the dodecapeptide was also synthesized attached at its carboxyl terminus to poly(ethylene oxide), a macromolecular protecting group. analogues in which lys or his was modified exhibited high biological activity as evidenced by their ability to elicit aberrant morphologies in a cells of s. cerevisiae. these results suggest that neither a free alpha amine nor a protonatable side chain at position is necessary for biological activity of the dodecapeptide alpha factor. although ala and phe dodecapeptides were not biologically active, they competed with the natural alpha factor and several active analogues. thus binding of the alpha factor is not sufficient to elicit a biological response; it appears that the side chain in position is critical for triggering morphological alterations in a cells.
