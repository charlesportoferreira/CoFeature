a saccharomyces servazzii clone homologous to saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome iii spanning kar, ars and spb lacks the recombination enhancer but contains an unknown orf.. . in order to learn about the evolutionary conservation of the recombination enhancer (re) that controls donor preference during mating type switching in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have cloned a kb region from s. servazzii. we find that the order of four genes surrounding the re in s. cerevisiae (prd, kar, spb and pbn) is preserved in s.servazzii. however, there is an additional orf in s. servazzii between prd and kar that is not homologous to any gene in s. cerevisiae or to genes in other organisms. despite a % amino acid identity for kar and spb, respectively, the s. servazzii sequence did not carry a well conserved re sequence and these sequences lacked re function when introduced into s. cerevisiae. the s. servazzii region contains a sequence that supports autonomous dna replication in s. cerevisiae and may represent a homologue of ars. the s. servazziii sequence has genbank accession no. bankit af. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
