a novel aspartyl protease allowing kex independent mf alpha propheromone processing in yeast.. . mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae which lack the kex encoded endopeptidase are unable to process proteolytically the mating factor alpha (mf alpha) propheromone produced from the chromosomal mf alpha and mf alpha genes (julius et al., ). overproduction of pheromone precursor from multiple, plasmid borne mf alpha genes did, however, lead to the production of active mf alpha peptides in the absence of the kex gene product. s. cerevisiae therefore must possess an alternative processing enzyme. the cleavage site of this enzyme appeared identical to that of the kex encoded endopeptidase. to identify the gene responsible for the alternative processing, we have isolated clones which allowed production of mature mf alpha in a kex disrupted strain even from the chromosomal mf alpha genes. the gene isolated in this way was shown also to be essential for the kex independent processing of propheromone overproduced from plasmid borne mf alpha . the amino acid sequence deduced from the gene shows extensive homology to a number of aspartyl proteases including the pep and bar gene products from s. cerevisiae. in contrast to the bar gene product, the novel aspartyl protease (yap for yeast aspartyl protease ) contains a c terminal serine/threonine rich sequence and potential transmembrane domain similar to those found in the kex gene product. the corresponding gene yap was located to chromosome xii. the normal physiological role of the yap gene product is not known. strains disrupted in yap are both viable and able to process the mating factor a precursor.
