glycosylation and structure of the yeast mf alpha alpha factor precursor is important for efficient transport through the secretory pathway.. . the mf alpha gene encodes a precursor, prepro alpha factor, that undergoes several proteolytic processing steps within the classical secretory pathway to produce the mature peptide pheromone, alpha factor. to investigate the role of structural features of the mf alpha precursor in alpha factor production, we analyzed the effect of mf alpha mutations that alter precursor structure in a number of ways. these mutations resulted in decreased alpha factor secretion and intracellular accumulation of pro alpha factor. with the exception of the mutant lacking all three n glycosylation sites, the pro alpha factor forms that accumulated were core glycosylated but had not yet undergone the addition of outer chain carbohydrate. the delay, therefore, occurred at a step prior to the first proteolytic processing step involved in maturation of the precursor and was probably due to inefficient endoplasmic reticulum to golgi transport. elimination of all three n glycosylation sites caused a delay in disappearance of intracellular precursor, and alpha factor secretion was also slowed. these data indicate that n glycosylation is important but not essential for transport of the precursor through the secretory pathway. the decreased alpha factor secretion and increased precursor accumulation seen with many different structural changes of pro alpha factor indicate that the secretory pathway is extremely sensitive to changes in precursor structure. this sensitivity could cause inefficient secretion of heterologous proteins and hybrids between mf alpha and heterologous proteins in yeast cells.
