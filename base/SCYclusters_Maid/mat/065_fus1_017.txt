rvsp interacts with fusp to promote cell fusion in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . fus was previously identified by a mutation that causes a defect in cell fusion in a screen for bilateral mating defects. here we show that fus is allelic to rvs/end, a gene implicated in a variety of processes including viability after starvation, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeletal organization. two lines of evidence indicate that rvs/end's endocytic function is not required for cell fusion. first, several other endocytic mutants showed no cell fusion defects. second, we isolated five function specific alleles of rvs/fus that were defective for endocytosis, but not mating, and three alleles that were defective for cell fusion but not endocytosis. the organization of the actin cytoskeleton was normal in the cell fusion mutants, indicating that rvsp's function in cell fusion is independent of actin organization. the three to fourfold induction of rvs by mating pheromone and the localization of rvsp gfp to the cell fusion zone suggested that rvsp plays a direct role in cell fusion. the phenotypes of double mutants, the coprecipitation of rvsp and fusp, and the fact that the stability of fusp was strongly dependent on rvsp's mating function lead to the conclusion that rvsp is required to interact with fusp for efficient cell fusion.
