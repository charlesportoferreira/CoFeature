srd, a s. cerevisiae gene affecting pre rrna processing contains a c/c zinc finger motif.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, rrp and srd, are involved in processing rrna precursor species to mature rrnas. we reported previously that the rrp mutation caused temperature sensitive lethality, hypersensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics, and defective processing of s pre rrna to s and .s mature rrnas. a second site suppressor of the rrp mutation, srd, corrects all three rrp mutant phenotypes. in order to learn more about the roles of the srd and rrp genes in rrna processing, we cloned and characterized the srd gene. we identified an orf, ycrc, that complements srd suppression of rrp . the dna is physically located at the region of chromosome iii where srd has been genetically mapped. srd encodes a putative amino acid, kda protein containing a c/c zinc finger motif that is also found in some transcription regulators and the eif beta translation initiating factors. the similarity of srd to transcription regulators led us to test the model that srd mutations suppress rrp defects by altering the level of the rrp transcript. however, we found that srd has no detectable effect on the steady state levels of rrp mrna. we describe alternative models to explain the role of srdp in pre rrna processing.
