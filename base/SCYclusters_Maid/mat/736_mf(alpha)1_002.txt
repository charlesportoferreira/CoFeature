probing the functional conformation of the tridecapeptide mating pheromone of saccharomyces cerevisiae through study of disulfide constrained analogs.. . analogs of the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha mating factor, trp his trp leu gln leu lys pro gly gln pro met tyr, where lys and gln were replaced with cys, cys(ch), or ser, were synthesized using solid phase procedures on a phenylacetamidomethyl resin. cyclo,[cys,x,cys,nle]alpha factor , where x=d val, d ala, l ala and gly, were prepared by on resin cyclization using thallic trifluoroacetate in yields of %. linear sulfhydryl containing peptides were generated from their corresponding cyclic peptide by treatment with dithioerythritol in basic solution. in the linear analogs, replacement of both lys and gln with a cysteine residue resulted in an over fold loss of the biological activity when compared with the native pheromone. the corresponding cyclic disulfides were fold more active than their sulfhydryl containing homologs, and cyclo,[cys,l ala,cys,nle] alpha factor was fold more potent than linear analogs containing ser or cys(ch) in positions and . binding competition studies indicated that all analogs had low affinity for the alpha factor receptor and there was a poor correlation between binding and activity in a growth arrest assay. a cyclic analog in which residues and were replaced by aminopentanoic acid was not biologically active. based on nmr studies, all cyclic peptides have a higher tendency to form beta turns spanning residues than their less active linear counterparts. the results provide strong evidence that this beta turn is important for optimal signal transduction by alpha factor.
