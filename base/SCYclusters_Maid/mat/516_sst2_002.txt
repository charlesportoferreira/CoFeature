regulation of stress response signaling by the n terminal dishevelled/egl /pleckstrin domain of sst, a regulator of g protein signaling in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . all members of the regulator of g protein signaling (rgs) family contain a conserved core domain that can accelerate g protein gtpase activity. the rgs in yeast, sst, can inhibit a g protein signal leading to mating. in addition, some rgs proteins contain an n terminal domain of unknown function. here we use complementary whole genome analysis methods to investigate the function of the n terminal sst domain. to identify a signaling pathway regulated by n sst, we performed genome wide transcription profiling of cells expressing this fragment alone and found differences in transcripts. of these, are induced by n sst, and nearly all contain a stress response element (stre) in the promoter region. to identify components of a signaling pathway leading from n sst to stres, we performed a genome wide two hybrid analysis using n sst as bait and found interacting proteins. to identify the functionally relevant interacting proteins, we analyzed all of the available gene deletion mutants and found three (vps delta, pep delta, and tlg delta) that induce stre and also repress pheromone dependent transcription. we selected vps for further characterization. a vps delta mutation diminishes signaling by pheromone as well as by downstream components including the g protein, effector kinase (ste), and transcription factor (ste). conversely, overexpression of vps enhances the pheromone response in sst delta cells but not in wild type. these findings indicate that vps and sst have opposite and opposing effects on the pheromone and stress response pathways, with vps acting downstream of the g protein and independently of sst rgs activity.
