structure function analysis of the saccharomyces cerevisiae tridecapeptide pheromone using alanine scanned analogs.. . twenty six peptide analogs of the saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha factor, a tridecapeptide mating pheromone (whwlqlkpgqlpmy) with either l or d alanine replacement of each amino acid residue (ala scanned) and with the isosteric replacement of methionine at position by norleucine, were synthesized, purified to homogeneity and assayed for biological activity and receptor binding. two new and effective antagonists, [d ala,nle]alpha factor and [d ala,nle]alpha factor, were found among the series, and the [d ala,nle]alpha factor demonstrated a marked ability to increase the biological activity of [nle]alpha factor without having any effect by itself. one analog, the [l ala alpha factor, showed a fold increase in bioactivity over the [nle]alpha factor, although its binding to the alpha factor receptor was about fold less than [nle]alpha factor. residues near the carboxyl terminus contributed more strongly to receptor binding than other residues, whereas those near the amine terminus of the alpha factor played an important role in signal transduction. the effect of insertion of d ala residues at positions , , and on bioactivity and receptor binding of the peptide suggested a specific positioning role of the central loop in establishing optimal contacts between the receptor and the ends of the pheromone. we conclude that the alpha factor may be divided into segments with dominant roles in forming the biologically active pheromone conformation, in receptor binding and in initiating signal transduction. the discovery of such relationships was made possible by the systematic variation of each residue in the peptide and by the testing of each analog in highly defined biological and binding assays.
