regulation of alpha factor production in saccharomyces cerevisiae. a factor pheromone induced expression of the mf alpha and ste genes.. . production of the mating pheromone alpha factor was examined in saccharomyces cerevisiae mat alpha cells that had been exposed to the mating pheromone a factor. a h treatment with a factor caused a significant increase in alpha factor concentration in the medium as demonstrated by a halo assay. mf alpha is one of the two genes coding for a precursor of alpha factor. a northern (rna) analysis of total rna from a factor treated mat alpha cells revealed a rapid two to threefold increase in mf alpha transcript levels, reaching maximum within min of exposure to the pheromone. pheromone induction did not require ongoing protein synthesis. a factor induced mf alpha expression was quantitated by analysis of an mf alpha .suc fusion gene whose product was assayed for invertase activity. expression of the mf alpha .suc gene in mat alpha cells responded to the a factor signal like the chromosomal version of mf alpha . maturation of the alpha factor precursor involves three proteolytic activities which are encoded by the kex, kex, and ste genes, respectively. two of these genes, namely, kex and ste, were examined for pheromone induced expression. only the ste gene exhibited pheromone induction at the transcriptional level.
