fus localizes near the site of cell fusion and is required for both cell fusion and nuclear alignment during zygote formation.. . zygote formation occurs through tightly coordinated cell and nuclear fusion events. genetic evidence suggests that the fus gene product promotes cell fusion during zygote formation in saccharomyces cerevisiae, functioning with the fus plasma membrane protein at or before cell wall and plasma membrane fusion. here we report the sequence of the fus gene, localization of fus protein, and show that fus and fus mutants have distinct defects in cell fusion. fus encodes a unique open reading frame of residues that only is expressed in haploid cells in response to mating pheromone. consistent with a role in cell fusion, fus protein localizes with discrete structures that could be of cytoskeletal or vesicular origin that accumulate at the tip of pheromone induced shmoos and at the junction of paired cells in zygotes. fus is predicted to be a coiled coil protein and fractionates with a , g pellet, suggesting that it is associated with cytoskeleton, membranes, or other macromolecular structures. fus may interact with structures involved in the alignment of the nuclei during cell fusion, because fus mutants have strong defects in karyogamy and fail to orient microtubules between parental nuclei in zygotes. in contrast, fus mutants show no karyogamy defects. these, and other results suggest that fus defines a novel cell fusion function and subcellular structure that is also required for the alignment of parental nuclei before nuclear fusion.
