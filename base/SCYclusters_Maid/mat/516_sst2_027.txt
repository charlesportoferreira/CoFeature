somatostatin receptors and regulation of cell proliferation.. . somatostatin is an inhibitory neuropeptide, which acts on various targets throughout the body to regulate a variety of physiological functions including inhibition of endocrine and exocrine secretions, modulation of neurotransmission, motor and cognitive functions, inhibition of intestinal motility, absorption of nutrients and ions, vascular contractility and inhibition of normal and tumour cell proliferation. it exerts its effects through interaction with five somatostatin receptors (sst sst), which belong to the family of g protein coupled receptors with seven transmembrane spanning domains and are variably expressed in a variety of tumours such as gastroenteropancreatic tumours, pituitary tumours, and carcinoid tumours. this review covers the present knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in somatostatin antineoplastic activity. evidence that sst receptor acts as a tumour suppressor is also discussed.
