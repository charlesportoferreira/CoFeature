feedback phosphorylation of an rgs protein by map kinase in yeast.. . regulators of g protein signaling (rgs proteins) are well known to accelerate g protein gtpase activity in vitro and to promote g protein desensitization in vivo. less is known about how rgs proteins are themselves regulated. to address this question we purified the rgs in yeast, sst, and used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to identify post translational modifications. this analysis revealed that sst is phosphorylated at ser and that phosphorylation occurs in response to pheromone stimulation. ser lies within a consensus mitogen activated protein (map) kinase phosphorylation site, pro x ser pro. phosphorylation is blocked by mutations in the map kinase genes (fus, kss), as well as by mutations in components needed for map kinase activation (ste, ste, ste, ste). phosphorylation is also blocked by replacing ser with ala, asp, or glu (but not thr). these point mutations do not alter pheromone sensitivity, as determined by growth arrest and reporter transcription assays. however, phosphorylation appears to slow the rate of sst degradation. these findings indicate that the g protein regulated map kinase in yeast can act as a feedback regulator of sst, itself a regulator of g protein signaling.
