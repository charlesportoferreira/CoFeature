the snf protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a glutamine and proline rich transcriptional activator that affects expression of a broad spectrum of genes.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae snf gene affects expression of both glucose and phosphate regulated genes and appears to function in transcription. we report the nucleotide sequence, which predicts that snf encodes a , dalton protein. the n terminal third of the protein is extremely rich in glutamine and proline. mutants carrying a deletion of the coding sequence were viable but grew slowly, indicating that the snf gene is important but not essential. evidence that snf affects expression of the cell type specific genes mf alpha and bar at the rna level extends the known range of snf function. snf is apparently required for expression of a wide variety of differently regulated genes. a bifunctional snf beta galactosidase fusion protein was localized in the nucleus by immunofluorescence. no dna binding activity was detected for snf. a lexa snf fusion protein, when bound to a lexa operator, functioned as a transcriptional activator.
