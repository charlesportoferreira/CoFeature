structure of a yeast pheromone gene (mf alpha). a putative alpha factor precursor contains four tandem copies of mature alpha factor.. . we have cloned and sequenced a gene (mf alpha) coding for alpha factor, a tridecapeptide mating factor secreted by yeast alpha cells. a plasmid carrying the mf alpha gene was identified by screening for production of alpha factor by mat alpha mutants, which fail to secrete alpha factor because of simultaneous synthesis and degradation of the factor. the cloned segment codes for four mature alpha factor within a putative precursor of amino acids. the putative precursor begins as a signal sequence for secretion. the next segment, of approximately amino acids, contains three potential glycosylation sites. the carboxy terminal half of the precursor contains four tandem copies of mature alpha factor, each preceded by spacer peptides of six or eight amino acids (variations of lys arg glu ala asp ala glu ala), which are hypothesized to contain proteolytic processing signals.
