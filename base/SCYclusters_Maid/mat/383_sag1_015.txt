cell surface anchorage and ligand binding domains of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell adhesion protein alpha agglutinin, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily.. . alpha agglutinin is a cell adhesion glycoprotein expressed on the cell wall of saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha cells. binding of alpha agglutinin to its ligand a agglutinin, expressed by a cells, mediates cell cell contact during mating. analysis of truncations of the amino acid alpha agglutinin structural gene ag alpha delineated functional domains of alpha agglutinin. removal of the c terminal hydrophobic sequence allowed efficient secretion of the protein and loss of cell surface attachment. this cell surface anchorage domain was necessary for linkage to a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. a construct expressing the n terminal amino acid residues retained full a agglutinin binding activity, localizing the binding domain to the n terminal portion of alpha agglutinin. a residue n terminal peptide was inactive; therefore, the binding domain includes residues between and . the segment of alpha agglutinin between amino acid residues and showed significant structural and sequence similarity to a consensus sequence for immunoglobulin superfamily variable type domains. the similarity of the alpha agglutinin binding domain to mammalian cell adhesion proteins suggests that this structure is a highly conserved feature of adhesion proteins in diverse eukaryotes.
