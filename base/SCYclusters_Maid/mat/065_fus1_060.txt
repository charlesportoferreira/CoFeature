cdc and cdc are negative elements in the signal transduction pathway of yeast.. . mutations in either the cdc or cdc gene cause yeast cells to arrest in g of the cell cycle at the same point as treatment with mating pheromone. we demonstrate here that strains harboring temperature sensitive mutations in cdc or cdc activate expression of the pheromone inducible gene fus when shifted to nonpermissive temperature. we show further that cell cycle arrest and induction of fus are dependent on known components of the mating factor response pathway, the ste genes. thus, the g arrest phenotype of cdc and cdc mutants results from activation of the mating factor response pathway. the cdc and cdc gene products behave formally as negative elements in the response pathway. they are required to block response in the absence of pheromone. epistasis analysis of mutants defective in cdc or cdc and different ste genes demonstrates that activation requires the response pathway g protein and suggests that cdc and cdc products may control synthesis or function of the g alpha subunit.
