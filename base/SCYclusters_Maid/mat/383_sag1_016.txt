alpha agglutinin expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a polyclonal antiserum raised against purified alpha agglutinin was made specific for alpha agglutinin after adsorption with a cells. the adsorbed antiserum identified alpha agglutinin peptides on western blots and bound to cell surface alpha agglutinin, inhibiting the binding of alpha cells to a cells. using the antibody, we have determined that ) the surface distribution of alpha agglutinin on alpha cells is polar, ) about x () molecules/cell are constitutively expressed on strain x b (alpha) cells, and ) treatment of alpha cells with the sex pheromone a factor causes an increase in cell surface alpha agglutinin, consistent with the a factor induced increase in cell agglutinability.
