the yeast srm protein and human rcc protein share analogous functions.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein srm and the mammalian protein rcc have amino acid sequence similarity throughout their lengths. srm was defined by a recessive mutation in yeast that both activates the signal transduction pathway required for mating and leads to arrest in the g phase of the cell cycle. rcc was defined by a recessive mutation in hamster cells that causes premature chromosome condensation and other characteristics of entry into mitosis. despite the seemingly different roles implied by these phenotypes, we suggest that rcc and srm proteins have similar functions. in particular, we find that rcc can complement the temperature sensitive growth phenotype of two independent srm mutations and also complements, at least partially, phenotypes associated with activation of the pheromone response pathway, such as transcription induction of fus. however, rcc fails to complement an srm null allele. further characterization of the srm mutant phenotype reveals a defect in plasmid and chromosome stability, suggesting that the mutants have a defect in dna replication, mitosis, or their coordination. finally, like rcc, srm is a nuclear protein. together, these data imply that srm and rcc have a common role in their respective organisms.
