a novel yeast secretion vector utilizing secretion signal of killer toxin encoded on the yeast linear dna plasmid pgkl.. . the nh terminal signal region comprising of approximately % length of the prepro sequence of the pgkl killer precursor protein was found to direct an efficient secretion of the mouse alpha amylase into the culture medium of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the alpha amylase molecule secreted into the culture medium was identified by both immuno blotting and assay of the enzyme activity. the amount of alpha amylase secreted via the killer toxin signal was comparable to that directed by the leader sequence of mating factor alpha. the secretion of alpha amylase using the killer toxin signal was blocked at c but not at c in sec host, indicating that alpha amylase is exported through the normal secretion pathway of s. cerevisiae.
