sexual response in saccharomyces cerevisiae. alteration of enzyme activity in the glyoxalase system by mating factor.. . glyoxalase i activity in alpha type budding yeast of the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was increased by exposure of alpha type cells to supernatant of a culture of a type yeast cells, although glyoxalase ii activity was decreased by the same treatment. the alteration of enzyme activity in the glyoxalase system occurred during the min period after exposure of alpha type cells to a type culture supernatant. no change of glyoxalase i and ii activities was found in the case of the alpha type strain, s. cerevisiae vq (alpha ste ), which is deficient in a factor receptors.
