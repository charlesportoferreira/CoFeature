growth rate influences mf alpha promoter activity in mat alpha saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the signal sequences of the mf alpha prepro alpha factor gene are frequently used to direct secretion of heterologous proteins from saccharomyces cerevisiae. they are often employed together with the mf alpha promoter in secretion vectors, such that this promoter directs the transcription of many heterologous gene cassettes in yeast. most of the existing literature indicates that the mf alpha promoter is constitutive in mat alpha cells, although some data suggests that it may be more active in respiratory or late logarithmic fermentative cultures. to identify whether there is a growth rate or medium control over mf alpha promoter activity a strain was constructed with an integrated mf alpha promoter beta galactosidase (lacz) reporter gene fusion. intracellular beta galactosidase of this strain during batch culture on glucose, raffinose and acetate showed that mf alpha promoter activity was higher during respiratory growth on acetate as compared to more rapid fermentative growth on glucose or raffinose, a result that might indicate this activity being inversely related to growth rate. chemostat culture confirmed that growth rate does indeed influence mf alpha promoter activity in glucose grown cells, the activity of this promoter increasing to . fold as dilution (growth) rates were reduced from maximal values to . h , but then decreasing with the further decreases in dilution rate needed for fully respiratory growth. thus a promoter generally thought to be constitutive in mat alpha cells is nevertheless subject to a complex growth rate control.
