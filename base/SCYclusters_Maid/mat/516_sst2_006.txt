a novel regulator of g protein signalling in yeast, rgs, downregulates glucose activation of the camp pathway through direct inhibition of gpa.. . we have characterized a novel member of the recently identified family of regulators of heterotrimeric g protein signalling (rgs) in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the yorw/rgs gene was isolated as a multi copy suppressor of glucose induced loss of heat resistance in stationary phase cells. the n terminal half of the rgs protein consists of a typical rgs domain. deletion and overexpression of rgs, respectively, enhances and reduces glucose induced accumulation of camp. overexpression of rgs generates phenotypes consistent with low activity of camp dependent protein kinase a (pka), such as enhanced accumulation of trehalose and glycogen, enhanced heat resistance and elevated expression of stre controlled genes. deletion of rgs causes opposite phenotypes. we demonstrate that rgs functions as a negative regulator of glucose induced camp signalling through direct gtpase activation of the gs alpha protein gpa. rgs and gpa constitute the second cognate rgs g alpha protein pair identified in yeast, in addition to the mating pheromone pathway regulators sst and gpa. moreover, rgs and sst exert specific, non overlapping functions, and deletion mutants in rgs and sst are complemented to some extent by different mammalian rgs proteins.
