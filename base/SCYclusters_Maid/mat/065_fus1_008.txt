mutations in the yrb gene encoding yeast ran binding protein that impair nucleocytoplasmic transport and suppress yeast mating defects.. . we identified two temperature sensitive (ts) mutations in the essential gene, yrb, which encodes the yeast homolog of ran binding protein (ranbp), a known coregulator of the ran gtpase cycle. both mutations result in single amino acid substitutions of evolutionarily conserved residues (ad and rk, respectively) in the ran binding domain of yrb. the altered proteins have reduced affinity for ran (gsp) in vivo. after shift to restrictive temperature, both mutants display impaired nuclear protein import and one also reduces poly(a)+ rna export, suggesting a primary defect in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. consistent with this conclusion, both yrbts mutations display deleterious genetic interactions with mutations in many other genes involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including srp (alpha importin) and several beta importin family members. these yrbts alleles were isolated by their ability to suppress two different types of mating defective mutants (respectively, fusdelta and stets), indicating that reduction in nucleocytoplasmic transport enhances mating proficiency. indeed, in both yrbts mutants, ste (scaffold protein for the pheromone response mapk cascade) is mislocalized to the cytosol, even in the absence of pheromone. also, both yrbts mutations suppress the mating defect of a null mutation in msn, which encodes the receptor for pheromone stimulated nuclear export of ste. our results suggest that reimport of ste into the nucleus is important in downregulating mating response.
