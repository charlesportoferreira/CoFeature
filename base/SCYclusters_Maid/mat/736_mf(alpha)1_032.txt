genetic manipulation of saccharomyces cerevisiae by use of the lys gene.. . the structural gene for alpha aminoadipate reductase (lys) was isolated from a saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic dna library by complementation of a lys mutant. both genetic and biochemical criteria confirmed that the dna obtained corresponds to the lys locus on chromosome ii. subcloning and deletion analysis showed that a functional lys gene is contained within a . kilobase (kb) ecori hindiii fragment of the original insert, and the slightly larger ecori clai segment (. kb) was used to construct a series of cloning vehicles, including integrating, episomal, replicative, and centromeric vectors. the cloned dna was also used to generate a genomic deletion that lacks all lys coding sequences on chromosome ii. the level of the lys transcript (. kb) was fold higher in cells grown on minimal medium than in cells grown on complete medium and was not repressed by the presence of lysine alone. gene disruption, gene replacement, and promoter analysis of the major alpha factor structural gene (mf alpha ) were performed to illustrate the utility of the lys gene for the genetic manipulation of yeasts. because all fungi synthesize lysine via the alpha aminoadipate pathway, the techniques developed here for using the s. cerevisiae lys gene should be directly applicable to other fungal systems.
