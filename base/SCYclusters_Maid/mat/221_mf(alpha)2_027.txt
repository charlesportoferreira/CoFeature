morphogenic effects of alpha factor on saccharomyces cerevisiae a cells.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type a cells enlarged and elongated when exposed to alpha factor, a sex pheromone produced by mating type alpha cells. this morphogensis required exogenous d glucose, nitrogen, and phosphate, and cells in exponential phase responded better than stationary phase cells. morphogenesis was blocked by cycloheximide and by inhibitors of cell wall biosynthesis such as deoxy d glucose, deoxy fluoro d glucose, and deoxy fluoro d mannose, but not by polyoxin d. one to two hours after addition of pheromone, a cells became more susceptible to lysis by glucanases, a change that was dependendent on the dose of alpha factor and was blocked by drugs that block morphogenesis. on the other hand, treatment with alpha factor did not increase susceptibility to attack by trypsin, subtilisin, or exo alpha mannanase. radioactive label, incorporated into cell wall polysaccharides during treatment with alpha factor, was not secreted into the medium during morphogenesis. analysis of the labeled wall polymers showed that alpha factor treated cells contain more glucan and less mannan than control cells, and that the mannan of treated cells contains an increased proportion of shorter side chains and unsubstituted backbone mannose units. thin section electron microscopy of treated cells revealed that the cell wall possesses a diffuse outer layer in the extension and is thinner at the tip.
