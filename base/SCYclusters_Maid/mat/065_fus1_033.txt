ras signals via the cdc/ste/mitogen activated protein kinase module to induce filamentous growth in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . rasval, a dominant activated form of saccharomyces cerevisiae ras, stimulates both filamentous growth and expression of a transcriptional reporter fg(tya).lacz but does not induce the mating pathway reporter fus.lacz. this induction depends upon elements of the conserved mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway that is required for both filamentous growth and mating, two distinct morphogenetic events. full induction requires ste (homolog of mammalian ppak protein kinases), ste [an mek kinase (mekk) or mapk kinase (mek) kinase], ste (mek or mapk kinase), and the transcription factor ste. moreover, the rho family protein cdc, a conserved morphogenetic g protein, is also a potent regulator of filamentous growth and fg(tya).lacz expression in s. cerevisiae. stimulation of both filamentous growth and fg(tya).lacz by cdc depends upon ste. in addition, dominant negative cdcala blocks rasval activation, placing cdc downstream of ras. our results suggest that filamentous growth in budding yeast is regulated by an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that controls cell morphology.
