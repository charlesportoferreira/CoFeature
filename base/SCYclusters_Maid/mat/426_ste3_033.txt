asgp step inhibition of pheromone signaling. regulation of the zygotic transition to vegetative growth.. . the inappropriate expression of the a factor pheromone receptor (step) in the mata cell leads to a striking inhibition of the yeast pheromone response, the result of a functional interaction between step and some mata specific protein. the present work identifies this protein as asgp. normally, expression of step and asgp is limited to distinct haploid mating types, step to matalpha cells and asgp to mata cells. artificial coexpression of the two in the same cell, either a or alpha, leads to dramatic inhibition of the pheromone response. step asgp coexpression also perturbs the membrane trafficking of step. step turnover is slowed, a result of an asgp mediated retardation of the secretory delivery of the newly synthesized receptor to the plasma membrane. however, in the absence of ectopic step expression, the asgdelta mutation is without consequence either for pheromone signaling or overall mating efficiency of a cells. indeed, the sole phenotype that can be assigned to mata asgdelta cells is observed following zygotic fusion to its alpha mating partner. though formed at wild type efficiency, zygotes from these pairings are morphologically abnormal. the pattern of growth is deranged. emergence of the first mitotic bud is delayed, and, in its place, growth is apparently diverted into a novel structure superficially resembling the polarized mating projection characteristic of haploid cells responding to pheromone. together these results suggest a mechanism in which, following the zygotic fusion event, step and asgp gain access to one another and together act to repress the pheromone response, promoting the transition of the new diploid cell to vegetative growth.
