a large pest like sequence directs the ubiquitination, endocytosis, and vacuolar degradation of the yeast a factor receptor.. . the yeast a factor receptor (encoded by ste) is subject to two modes of endocytosis, a ligand dependent endocytosis as well as a constitutive, ligand independent mode. both modes are associated with receptor ubiquitination (roth, a.f., and n.g. davis. . j. cell biol. . ) and both depend on sequence elements within the receptor's regulatory, cytoplasmically disposed, cooh terminal domain (ctd). here, we concentrate on the step sequences required for constitutive endocytosis. constitutive endocytosis is rapid. receptor is synthesized, delivered to the cell surface, endocytosed, and then delivered to the vacuole where it is degraded, all with a t/ of min. deletion analysis has defined a residue long sequence mapping near the cooh terminal end of the step ctd that is the minimal sequence required for this rapid turnover. deletions intruding into this interval block or severely slow the rate of endocytic turnover. moreover, the same residue sequence directs receptor ubiquitination. mutants deleted for this sequence show undetectable levels of ubiquitination, and mutants having intermediate endocytosis defects show a correlated reduced level of ubiquitination. not only necessary for ubiquitination and endocytosis, this sequence also is sufficient. when transplanted to a stable cell surface protein, the plasma membrane atpase pmap, the residue ste signal directs both ubiquitination of the pma ste fusion protein as well as its endocytosis and consequent vacuolar degradation. alanine scanning mutagenesis across the residue long interval highlights its overall complexity no singular sequence motif or signal is found, instead required sequence elements distribute throughout the entire interval. the high proportion of acidic and hydroxylated amino acid residues in this interval suggests a similarity to pest sequences a broad class of sequences which have been shown to direct the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation of short lived nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. a likely possibility, therefore, is that this sequence, responsible for both endocytosis and ubiquitination, may be first and foremost a ubiquitination signal. finally, we present evidence suggesting that the true signal in the wild type receptor extends beyond the residue long sequence defined as a minimal signal to include contiguous pest like sequences which extend another residues to the cooh terminus of step. together with sequences identified in two other yeast plasma membrane proteins, the ste sequence defines a new class of ubiquitination/endocytosis signal.
