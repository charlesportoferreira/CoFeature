single amino acid substitutions within the signal sequence of yeast prepro alpha factor affect membrane translocation.. . we used a genetic approach to identify point mutations in the signal sequence of a secreted eucaryotic protein, yeast alpha factor. signal sequence mutants were obtained by selecting for cells that partially mistargeted into mitochondria a fusion protein consisting of the alpha factor signal sequence fused to the mature portion of an imported mitochondrial protein (cox iv). the mutations resulted in replacement of a residue in the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence with either a hydrophilic amino acid or a proline. after reassembly into an intact alpha factor gene, the substitutions were found to decrease up to fold the rate of translocation of prepro alpha factor across microsomal membranes in vitro. two of three mutants tested produced lower steady state levels of alpha factor in intact yeast cells, although the magnitude of the effect was less than that in the cell free system.
