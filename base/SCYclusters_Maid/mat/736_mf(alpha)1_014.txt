effect of a pmr disruption and different signal sequences on the intracellular processing and secretion of cyamopsis tetragonoloba alpha galactosidase by saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we fused the yeast derived sequences encoding the invertase, acid phosphatase and alpha factor pre and prepro signal peptides (sp) to the cyamopsis tetragonoloba (guar plant) alpha galactosidase(alpha gal) encoding gene and expressed these gene fusions in yeast. whereas the amount of fusion protein produced by each of the constructs did not vary significantly, the secretion efficiency of the fusion protein that carried the sp of the prepro alpha factor (mf alpha ) was consistently found to be about % higher than that of the other fusions (% vs. %). furthermore, when the secretion of alpha gal was directed by the invertase (suc) sp, the intracellular enzyme localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (er), whereas use of the mf alpha sp caused the intracellular enzyme to be outer chain glycosylated and processed by the kex endoproteinase, implying that it had passed the er. these results suggest that the pro peptide of mf alpha stimulates the efflux of the heterologous protein from the er. null mutants of pmr (encoding a ca(+) dependent atpase) are known to give higher secretion efficiencies for a number of different heterologous proteins. therefore, we also studied the secretion of alpha gal in a pmr disruption mutant. structural analysis of the enzyme secreted by the mutant cells showed that it was completely processed by kex and outer chain glycosylated, although the length of the outer chain carbohydrate moiety was reduced when compared with the enzyme secreted by wild type cells. these results contradict the hypothesis advanced by rudolph et al. [cell () ] that disruption of pmr causes the secretory pathway to bypass the golgi apparatus.
