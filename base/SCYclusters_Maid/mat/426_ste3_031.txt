vpsp cue domain ubiquitin binding is required for efficient endocytic protein traffic.. . rab gtpases are key regulators of protein trafficking through the early stages of the endocytic pathway. the yeast rab ortholog vpsp is activated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor vpsp. here we show that vpsp binds ubiquitin and that the cue domain is necessary and sufficient for this interaction. vpsp ubiquitin binding is required for efficient endocytosis of step but not for the delivery of the biosynthetic cargo carboxypeptidase y to the vacuole. in addition, vpsp is itself monoubiquitylated. ubiquitylation is dependent on a functional cue domain and rspp, an e ligase that participates in cell surface receptor endocytosis. these findings define a new ubiquitin binding domain and implicate ubiquitin as a modulator of vpsp function in the endocytic pathway.
