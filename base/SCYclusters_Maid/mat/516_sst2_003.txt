rgs is a myeloerythroid lineage specific regulator of g protein signalling molecule highly expressed in megakaryocytes.. . myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis are controlled by haematopoietic growth factors, including cytokines, and chemokines that bind to g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs). regulators of g protein signalling (rgss) are a protein family that can act as gtpase activating proteins for g(alphai) and g(alphaq) class proteins. we have identified a new member of the r subfamily of rgs proteins, rgs. rgs contains clusters of hydrophobic and basic residues, which are characteristic of an amphipathic helix within its first amino acids. rgs mrna was most highly abundant in megakaryocytes, and was also detected specifically in haematopoietic progenitor and myeloerythroid lineage cells. rgs mrna was not detected in cells of the lymphoid lineage. rgs was also highly expressed in mouse embryonic day livers, livers being the principal organ for haematopoiesis at this stage of fetal development. rgs, rgs and rgs, other members of the r subfamily, were expressed in distinct progenitor and mature myeloerythroid and lymphoid lineage blood cells. rgs was shown to interact specifically with the g(alphai ) subunit in membranes from k cells. furthermore, overexpression of rgs inhibited mitogen activated protein kinase activation in hek /chemokine receptor cells treated with monocyte chemotactic protein . in yeast cells, rgs overexpression complemented a pheromone sensitive phenotype caused by mutations in the endogeneous yeast rgs gene, sst. these data demonstrated that rgs was expressed most highly in megakaryocytes, and can modulate gpcr pathways in both mammalian and yeast cells in vitro. hence rgs might have an important role in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation and chemotaxis.
