genetic characterization of an alpha specific gene responsible for sexual agglutinability in saccharomyces cerevisiae. mapping and gene dose effect.. . a recessive ag alpha mutation leads to specific defect in sexual agglutinability specifically in alpha cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the cryptopleurine resistance gene cryr , closely linked to the mating type locus, was used to select alpha/alpha strains which emerged from alpha/alpha strains by mitotic nonreciprocal recombination, to genetically analyse ag alpha , since ag alpha is expressed only in alpha mating type. the ag alpha gene was found to be linked to the centromere tightly, to met at . cm, and to ilv at cm on chromosome x. sexual agglutinability of alpha cells was shown to be dependent on the dose of the ag alpha gene, using alpha/alpha isogenic strains carrying ag alpha /ag alpha , ag alpha /ag alpha or ag alpha /ag alpha . the sst mutation did not suppress the ag alpha mutation. based on these results, function of the ag alpha gene is discussed.
