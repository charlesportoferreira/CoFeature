yeast peptide pheromones, a factor and alpha factor, activate a common response mechanism in their target cells.. . we show that in yeast the cell type specificity of pheromone response is determined solely by the species of receptor that a cell synthesizes. the two receptor pheromone interactions are functionally interchangeable and involve the creation of a common intracellular signal. in particular, we find that provision of a factor receptor or alpha factor receptor in mat alpha mutants, which normally do not express either receptor or any other a or alpha specific products, allows response to the appropriate pheromone. moreover, provision of a factor receptor in a cells lacking alpha factor receptor restores mating competence to those cells. finally, an aspect of pheromone response that is normally unique to a factor action on alpha cells increased transcription from the alpha specific ste gene can also be observed following alpha factor treatment of pseudo a cells (mat alpha ste ste), special mutants that respond to alpha factor and also have an active ste promoter.
