alpha factor leader sequence directed transport of escherichia coli beta galactosidase in the secretory pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the construction of two fused genes is described. one involves the in frame fusion of the yeast prepro alpha factor coding sequence, and the escherichia coli lac z gene. the second gene fusion utilizes a bp yeast invertase nh terminal coding sequence at the fusion junction of the hybrid gene described above. the gene fusions, under the control of the alpha factor promoter, expressed active beta galactosidase in alpha haploid yeast cells. the activity could be regulated in a temperature sensitive sir mutant. the incorporation of the invertase coding sequence at the mf alpha lacz fusion junction provided significantly higher levels of beta galactosidase activity. a substantial quantity of the hybrid proteins generated from the gene fusions was primarily localized in the intracellular membranes of yeast cells, while a processed form could be secreted into the periplasm.
