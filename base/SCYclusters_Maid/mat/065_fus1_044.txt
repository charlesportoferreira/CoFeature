characterization of fus of schizosaccharomyces pombe. a developmentally controlled function needed for conjugation.. . in schizosaccharomyces pombe, the fus mutation blocks conjugation at a point after cell contact and agglutination. the cell walls separating the mating partners are not degraded, which prevents cytoplasmic fusion. in order to investigate the molecular mechanism of conjugation, we cloned the fus gene and found that it is capable of encoding a , amino acid protein with no significant similarities to other known proteins. expression of the fus gene is regulated by the developmental state of the cells. transcription is induced by nitrogen starvation and requires a pheromone signal in both p and m cell types. consequently, mutants defective in the pheromone response pathway fail to induce fus expression. the ste gene, which encodes a transcription factor controlling expression of many genes involved in sexual differentiation, is also required for transcription of fus. furthermore, deletion of two potential ste recognition sites in the fus promoter region abolished transcription, and expression could be restored when we inserted a different ste site from the mat p promoter. since this element was inverted relative to the fus element, we conclude that activation of transcription by ste is independent of orientation. although the fus mutant has a phenotype very similar to that of saccharomyces cerevisiae fus mutants, the two proteins appear to have different roles in the process of cell fusion. budding yeast fus is a typical membrane protein and contains an sh domain. fission yeast fus has no features of a membrane protein, yet it appears to localize to the projection tip. a characteristic proline rich potential sh binding site may mediate interaction with other proteins.
