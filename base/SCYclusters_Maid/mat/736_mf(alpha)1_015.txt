the pro region of the yeast prepro alpha factor is essential for membrane translocation of human insulin like growth factor in vivo.. . four yeast secretion signals, the amino acid invertase signal sequence, the amino acid acid phosphatase signal sequence, and the pre sequence and prepro sequence of prepro alpha factor have been used to look for the secretion of recombinant human insulin like growth factor (igf) from saccharomyces cerevisiae. only the prepro sequence, often referred to as the alpha factor leader and consisting of an n terminal amino acid pre sequence or signal sequence attached to a amino acid pro region, permits secretion of igf. the signal sequences alone do not allow the translocation of igf into the endoplasmic reticulum. this is evident from the fact that igf like molecules, to which the signal sequences are still attached, accumulate intracellularly in the cytosol. fusion of the pro region of the alpha factor leader to the c terminus of the acid phosphatase and invertase signal sequences allows igf to be secreted once again. these results reveal the essential role of the pro region of the alpha factor leader in the secretion of igf and indicate that it may have a function in guiding a nascent igf polypeptide to a state in which translocation can occur.
