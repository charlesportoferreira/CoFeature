molecular characterization of sig, a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene involved in negative regulation of g protein mediated signal transduction.. . two recessive mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae sig (suppressor of inhibitory g protein) gene have been identified by their ability to suppress the signalling defect of dominant negative variants of the mating response g protein beta subunit. the mutations and deletion of sig enhance the sensitivity of the cells to pheromone and stimulate the basal transcription of a mating specific gene, fus, suggesting that sigp plays a negatively regulatory role in g beta gamma mediated signal transduction. an additional function of sigp in vegetatively growing cells is suggested by the finding that the mutations and deletion of sig cause temperature sensitive growth defects. the sig gene encodes a protein with a molecular weight of kda that contains at the amino terminus two zinc finger like sequence motifs. epistasis experiments localize the action of sigp within the pheromone signalling pathway at a position at or shortly after the g protein. we propose that sigp represents a novel negative regulator of g beta gamma mediated signal transduction.
