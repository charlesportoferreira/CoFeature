host cell properties and external ph affect proinsulin production by saccharomyces yeast.. . the expression of a hybrid gene encoding an alpha factor prepro leader peptide miniproinsulin (mpi) fusion [mpi is the same as the lysarg human insulin precursor described by thim et al. ()] was tested in a series of isogenic yeast strains to investigate the influence of some genetic and physiological factors on heterologous production in yeast. we found that. (i) an mf alpha gene disruption in haploid cells, as well as mf alpha gene product expression in diploid cells, do not affect the mpi secretion level; (ii) under conditions of exogenous leucine availability, mpi production is hindered by leucine auxotrophy (a leu mutation); (iii) rho mutations increase the per cell mpi yield approximately three fold; (iv) the mpi yield is apparently dependent on the ph of the culture medium. the higher the external ph, the larger the per cell mpi yield.
