schizosaccharomyces pombe map+ encodes the putative m factor receptor.. . a defect in the map gene of the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe causes h+ mating type specific sterility. this gene was cloned by complementation. nucleotide sequence analysis showed that it has a coding capacity of amino acids. the deduced map gene product is a putative seven transmembrane protein and has .% amino acid identity with the a factor receptor of saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoded by ste. it is also homologous with the ustilago maydis mating pheromone receptors. the map gene is expressed in h+ cells but not in h cells, and the transcripts are induced in response to nitrogen starvation. h+ cells defective in map do not respond to purified m factor. when map is expressed ectopically in h cells, they apparently acquire the ability to respond to the m factor produced by themselves. the gpa gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of a g protein presumed to couple with the mating pheromone receptors, is essential for this function of map. these observations strongly suggest that map encodes the m factor receptor. furthermore, this study provides strong support for the notion that pheromone signaling is essential for initiation of meiosis in s. pombe and that either m factor signaling or p factor signaling alone is sufficient.
