the mf alpha gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. genetic mapping and mutational analysis of promoter elements.. . the activity and cell type specificity of the promoter of the mf alpha gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae were examined by measuring expression of an mf alpha suc gene fusion in mata, mat alpha, and mata/mat alpha cells. a high level of invertase activity was observed only in mat alpha cells. weak expression occurred in mata cells when the hybrid gene was carried on a multicopy plasmid or on a centromere containing plasmid, but not when the hybrid gene was integrated at the normal mf alpha locus. analysis of a set of ' deletions of the promoter region of the mf alpha suc gene on the multicopy plasmid indicated that sequences from to upstream of the translational start site were required for high level expression in mat alpha cells. smaller internal deletions and insertions within the promoter region of the mf alpha suc gene were inserted into the genome at the normal mf alpha locus. these mutations further delineated four promoter domains important for expression. () two bp elements ( to and to ) with imperfect dyad symmetry; () a bp segment ( to ) that lies about bp upstream of the tata box; and () the tata box itself ( to ). the transcriptional start sites of the normal mf alpha promoter and of a mutant lacking the tata box were determined. the mf alpha locus was mapped to the left arm of chromosome xvi, about cm centromere proximal to the pep gene.
