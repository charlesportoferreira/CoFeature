identification of glycoprotein components of alpha agglutinin, a cell adhesion protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . several glycoproteins which inhibit the agglutinability of saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type a cells were partially purified from extracts of mating type alpha cells. these proteins, called alpha agglutinin, were labeled with i bolton hunter reagent. the labeled alpha agglutinin showed specific binding to a cells. such specific binding approached saturation with respect to agglutinin or cells and was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled alpha agglutinin. nonspecific binding was similar in a and alpha cells, was neither saturable nor competable, and was three to fourfold less than the specific binding to a cells at maximum tested agglutinin concentrations. the major a specific binding species had a low electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and had an apparent molecular weight of , by rate zonal centrifugation. endo n acetylglucosaminidase h digestion of the purified glycoprotein complex converted the low mobility material to four major and several minor bands which were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. all but two minor peptides bound specifically to a cells. analyses of agglutinin from mnn mutants confirmed the deglycosylation results in suggesting that the n linked carbohydrate portion of alpha agglutinin was not necessary for activity.
