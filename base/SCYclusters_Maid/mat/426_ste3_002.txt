the ste pheromone receptor gene of pneumocystis carinii is surrounded by a cluster of signal transduction genes.. . although the clinical aspects of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia are well characterized, the basic biology of the causative organism is poorly understood. most proposed life cycles of p. carinii include both asexual and sexual replicative cycles. the two most prominent morphological forms are a trophic form, thought to undergo asexual replication by binary fission, and a cystic form or ascus containing intracystic bodies or ascospores, the products of sexual replication. to facilitate the pneumocystis genome project, a p. carinii f. sp. carinii genomic cosmid library and an additional lambda cdna library were generated. a partial expressed sequence tag database, created as part of the genome project, revealed the transcription of meiosis specific genes and other genes related to sexual reproduction. the ortholog of ste, an a factor pheromone receptor, was cloned and genes surrounding the ste locus were examined. clustered around the ste gene are genes encoding elements functional in the pheromone response signal transduction cascade of model fungal organisms. these include the ste protein kinase, the ste homoeodomain transcriptional regulator, a potential pheromone mating factor, and other dna binding proteins. the genomic organization of the ste locus bears significant similarity to that of the mating locus recently described in cryptococcus neoformans. the p. carinii genome contains much of the genetic machinery necessary for pheromone responsiveness, and these data support the existence of a sexual replication cycle.
