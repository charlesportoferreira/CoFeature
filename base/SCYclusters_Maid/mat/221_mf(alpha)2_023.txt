comparison of dose response curves for alpha factor induced cell division arrest, agglutination, and projection formation of yeast cells. implication for the mechanism of alpha factor action.. . mat alpha cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae produce a polypeptide mating pheromone, alpha factor. mata cells respond to the pheromone by undergoing several inducible responses. the arrest of cell division, the production of a cell surface agglutinin, and the formation of one or more projections on the cell surface commonly termed the &quot;shmoo&quot; morphology. dose response curves were determined for each of these inducible responses as a function of alpha factor concentration. it is shown that under conditions commonly employed in previous studies, the dose response for cell division arrest is determined by the rate at which cells inactivate the alpha factor. in order to achieve conditions where inactivation would not be the dominant parameter, the cell division response to alpha factor was monitored at low cell densities. under conditions of essentially no alpha factor destruction, the dose of alpha factor at which cells exhibit a half maximal response for cell division arrest (. x ( ) m) is nearly the same as that at which cells exhibit a half maximal response for agglutination induction (. x ( ) m). on the contrary, the half maximal response for projection formation was obtained at doses of alpha factor orders of magnitude higher (. x ( ) m). these results are consistent with the same high affinity alpha factor receptor mediating both cell division arrest and agglutination induction. a different system of lower affinity must mediate projection formation. alternatively, if the same system and receptor are used, then a much higher occupancy is required for the induction of projections compared to division arrest and agglutination induction.
