evidence the yeast ste gene encodes a receptor for the peptide pheromone a factor. gene sequence and implications for the structure of the presumed receptor.. . haploid yeast cells of the a mating type secrete a peptide pheromone, a factor, which acts on cells of the alpha mating type to prepare them for conjugation. we show that the ste gene, which is required for mating only by alpha cells and is transcribed only in alpha cells, likely encodes a cell surface receptor for a factor. this view is based on three findings. first, wild type ste product is required for response to the pheromone. mutants with any one of five different ste mutations are unresponsive to a factor. second, a hybrid ste beta galactosidase protein encoded by a ste lacz gene fusion fractionates to the particulate fraction of yeast cell extracts, suggesting that ste is a membrane protein. finally, the dna sequence of ste, which we report here, encodes a protein of amino acid residues that contains seven distinct hydrophobic segments of sufficient length to span a lipid bilayer.
