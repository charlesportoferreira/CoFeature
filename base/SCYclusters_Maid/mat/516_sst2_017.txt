pheromone induced phosphorylation of a g protein beta subunit in s. cerevisiae is associated with an adaptive response to mating pheromone.. . the mating pheromone response in s. cerevisiae is activated by a g protein mediated signaling pathway in which g beta gamma is the active transducer of the signal. when exogenous pheromone is added to vegetatively growing cells, g beta is rapidly phosphorylated at several sites; phosphorylation does not require de novo protein synthesis. a mutation in g beta was constructed that eliminates signal induced phosphorylation. this mutation leads to enhanced sensitivity to and impaired ability to recover from pheromone, but does not affect the ability of g beta gamma to transmit the mating signal. these phenotypes suggest that g protein phosphorylation mediates an adaptive response to pheromone induced signaling. g beta phosphorylation does not require either the pheromone receptor c terminus or the product of the sst gene, both of which mediate separate adaptive responses to pheromone. however, g beta phosphorylation is greatly facilitated by the presence of the g alpha subunit, which has also been shown to participate in an adaptation to pheromone.
