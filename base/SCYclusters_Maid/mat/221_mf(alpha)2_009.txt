identification of a dna segment that is necessary and sufficient for alpha specific gene control in saccharomyces cerevisiae. implications for regulation of alpha specific and a specific genes.. . ste mrna is present only in saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha cells, not in a or a/alpha cells, and the transcript level increases about fivefold when cells are treated with a factor mating pheromone. deletions in the ' noncoding region of ste defined a base pair (bp) upstream activation sequence (uas) that can impart both modes of regulation to a cyc lacz fusion when substituted for the native cyc uas. uas activity required the alpha product of mat alpha, which is known to be required for transcription of alpha specific genes. a chromosomal deletion that removed only bp of the ste uas reduced ste transcript levels to fold, indicating that the uas is essential for expression. the ste uas shares a bp homology with the ' noncoding sequences of the only other known alpha specific genes, mf alpha and mf alpha . we view the homology as having two components a nearly palindromic bp &quot;p box&quot; and an adjacent bp &quot;q box.&quot; a synthetic ste p box was inactive as a uas; a perfect palindrome p box was active in all three cell types. we propose that the p box is the binding site for a transcription activator, but that alpha acting via the q box is required for this activator to bind to the imperfect p boxes of alpha specific genes. versions of the p box are also found upstream of a specific genes, within the binding sites of the repressor alpha encoded by mat alpha. thus, the products of mat alpha may render gene expression alpha or a specific by controlling access of the same transcription activator to its binding site, the p box.
