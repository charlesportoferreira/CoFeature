homology modeling of an immunoglobulin like domain in the saccharomyces cerevisiae adhesion protein alpha agglutinin.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae adhesion protein alpha agglutinin is expressed by cells of alpha mating type. on the basis of sequence similarities, alpha agglutinin has been proposed to contain variable type immunoglobulin like (igv) domains. the low level of sequence similarity to igv domains of known structure made homology modeling using standard sequence based alignment algorithms impossible. we have therefore developed a secondary structure based method that allowed homology modeling of alpha aggulutinin domain iii, the domain most similar to igv domains. the model was assessed and where necessary refined to accommodate information obtained by biochemical and molecular genetic approaches, including the positions of a disulfide bond, glycosylation sites, and proteolytic sites. the model successfully predicted surface exposure of glycosylation and proteolytic sites, as well as identifying residues essential for binding activity. one side of the domain was predicted to be covered by carbohydrate residues. surface accessibility and volume packing analyses showed that the regions of the model that have greatest sequence dissimilarity from the igv consensus sequence are poorly structured in the biophysical sense. nonetheless, the utility of the model suggests that these alignment and testing techniques should be of general use for building and testing of models of proteins that share limited sequence similarity with known structures.
