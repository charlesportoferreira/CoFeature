lack of a requirement for strict rotational alignment among transcription factor binding sites in yeast.. . the mf alpha gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae is an alpha specific gene whose expression is regulated by two upstream activation sites (uasmf alpha s), which are the binding sites for activator proteins, mat alpha and mcm. uasmf alpha elements act in a synergistic fashion; lack of either element causes reduced expression levels that are to fold less than that of intact promoter in alpha cells. we investigated the effect of manipulating rotational alignments among transcription factor binding sites of mf alpha on the expression of the gene. the expression level of mf alpha decreased with the spacing between the two uasmf alpha s and no synergism was observed when the distance of the two elements was longer than base pairs. no strict rotational alignment was required for their synergistic action. we also show that the spacing between uasmf alpha elements and tfiid binding site, the tata box, had little, if any, effect on mf alpha expression. we chose a sufficient number of positions for uasmf alpha s to ensure that, in several of these positions, mat alpha and mcm were on the opposite side of the dna helix with respect to the tata box.
