the yeast cell fusion protein fus is o glycosylated and spans the plasma membrane.. . previous work has shown that efficient cell fusion during conjugation in saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a pheromone induced surface protein encoded by fus. we show that the fus protein migrates on sds/polyacrylamide gels with an apparent molecular mass of kda, although the mass is predicted to be kda from the gene coding capacity. this discrepancy results from the presence of o linked mannose oligosaccharides attached to the clustered serines and threonines at the amino terminus of the protein. the addition of mannose is completely abolished in the early secretory mutant sec, attenuated in the late endoplasmic reticulum blocked sec, and unaffected in sec, which is blocked late in the golgi phase of secretion. membrane fractionation and protease protection experiments indicate that fus spans the plasma membrane, with its glycosylated amino terminus projecting into the periplasmic space.
