induction of the yeast alpha specific ste gene by the peptide pheromone a factor.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits two mating types, a and alpha. efficient mating of a and alpha cells requires the action of peptide pheromones secreted by each cell type. for example, a cells secrete a factor, which alters the physiology of alpha cells, thereby preparing those cells for mating. to investigate the mechanism by which the pheromones act on the target cells, we have examined the effect of a factor on expression of the ste gene, a gene which is required for mating by alpha cells and which is expressed only in alpha cells. we have monitored ste expression by two assays. rna production from the chromosomal ste locus and beta galactosidase activity produced from a plasmid borne ste lacz gene fusion. by both assays we show that a factor induces a rapid increase in ste expression. induction of ste rna occurs even if protein synthesis is blocked by cycloheximide. using temperature sensitive cell division cycle mutants, we have also shown that induction occurs in cells arrested at several discrete positions in the cell cycle. these results demonstrate () that induction of ste expression by a factor is a primary response to the pheromone, and () that alpha cells are capable of responding to a factor regardless of their position in the cell cycle.
