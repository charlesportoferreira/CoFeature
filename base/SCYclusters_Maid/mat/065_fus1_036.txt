constitutive activation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae mating response pathway by a map kinase kinase from candida albicans.. . the hst gene of candida albicans encodes a protein with structural similarity to map kinase kinases. expression of this gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae complements disruption of the ste map kinase kinase required for both mating in haploid cells and pseudohyphal growth in diploids. however, hst expression does not complement loss of either the pbs (hog) map kinase kinase required for response to high osmolarity, or loss of the mkk and mkk map kinase kinases required for proper cell wall biosynthesis. intriguingly, hst acts as a hyperactive allele of ste; expression of hst activates the mating pathway even in the absence of upstream signaling components including the ste regulator ste, elevates the basal level of the pheromone inducible fus gene, and amplifies the pseudohyphal growth response in diploid cells. thus hst appears to be at least partially independent of upstream activators or regulators, but selective in its activity on downstream target map kinases. creation of hst/ste hybrid proteins revealed that the c terminal two thirds of hst, which contains the protein kinase domain, is sufficient to confer this partial independence of upstream activators.
