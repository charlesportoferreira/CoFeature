rgs is a selective activator of g alpha i gtpase activity.. . polypeptides that define a protein family termed rgs (for regulators of g protein signalling) are encoded by the sst gene of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the egl gene of the nematode caenorhabdatis elegans, and several related mammalian genes. genetic studies in invertebrates and mammalian cell transfection experiments indicate that rgs proteins negatively regulate signalling pathways involving seven transmembrane receptors and heterotrimeric g proteins. however, the biochemical mechanism by which rgs proteins control these pathways is unknown. here we report the characterization of human rgs, a member of this protein family. co immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that rgs associates specifically with the activated forms of two related g protein subunits, g alphai, and g alphaz, but fails to interact with the structurally and functionally distinct g alphas subunit. in vitro assays with purified proteins indicate that rgs increases potently and selectively the gtp hydrolytic activity of several members of the g alphai family, including g alphai, g alphaz, and g alpha. these results demonstrate that rgs proteins can attenuate signalling pathways involving heterotrimeric g proteins by serving as gtpase activating proteins for specific types of g alpha subunits.
