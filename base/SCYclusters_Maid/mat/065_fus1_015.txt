cloning and characterisation of pga and pga. two g protein alpha subunits from pea that promote growth in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we report here on the cloning and characterization of two g protein alpha subunits from pea. pga and pga. based on dna gel blot analysis, pga and pga are the only galpha homologous sequences in pea. rt pcr analysis reveals that pga and pga transcripts are present in a variety of adult pea tissues. however, pga mrna is consistently detected at a lower level than pga and demonstrates some degree of tissue specificity relative to pga. in the apical bud of pea seedlings, pga and pga transcripts decrease in response to h of white light following growth for days in darkness. the g protein mediated, yeast mating pathway was used to analyse the function of pga and pga in vivo. pga downregulates the mating pathway, but through a mechanism that is independent of gbetagamma sequestration. unexpectedly, both pga and pga promote growth through a mating pathway independent mechanism.
