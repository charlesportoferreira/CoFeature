identification and regulation of a gene required for cell fusion during mating of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have devised a screen for genes from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae whose expression is affected by cell type or by the mating pheromones. from this screen we identified a gene, fus, whose pattern of expression revealed interesting regulatory strategies and whose product was required for efficient cell fusion during mating. transcription of fus occurred only in a and alpha cells, not in a/alpha cells, where it was repressed by a x alpha , a regulatory activity present uniquely in a/alpha cells. transcription of fus showed an absolute requirement for the products of five ste genes, ste, ste, ste, ste, and ste. since the activators ste, ste, and ste are themselves repressed by a x alpha , the failure to express fus in a/alpha cells is probably the result of a cascade of regulatory activities; repression of the activators by a x alpha in turn precludes transcription of fus. in addition to regulation of fus by cell type, transcription from the locus increased fold or more when a or alpha cells were exposed to the opposing mating pheromone. to investigate the function of the fus protein, we created fus null mutants. in fus x fus matings, the cells of a mating pair adhered tightly and appeared to form zygotes. however, the zygotes were abnormal. within the conjugation bridge the contained a partition that prevented nuclear fusion and mixing of organelles. the predicted sequence of the fus protein (deduced from the fus dna sequence) and subcellular fractionation studies with fus beta galactosidase hybrid proteins suggest that fus is a membrane or secreted protein. thus, fus may be located at a position within the cell where it is poised to catalyze cell wall or plasma membrane fusion.
