yeast alpha factor is processed from a larger precursor polypeptide. the essential role of a membrane bound dipeptidyl aminopeptidase.. . alpha factor mating pheromone is a peptide of amino acids secreted by saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha cells. nonmating (&quot;sterile,&quot; or ste) alpha cell mutants bearing defects in the ste gene do not produce normal alpha factor, but release a collection of incompletely processed forms (alpha factor) that have a markedly reduced specific biological activity. the major alpha factor peptides have the structures hn glualagluala alpha factor and hn aspalagluala alpha factor. the ste mutants lack a membrane bound heat stable dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (dpapase a) that specifically cleaves on the carboxyl side of repeating x ala sequences. absence of dpapase a and the other phenotypes of a ste lesion cosegregate in genetic crosses. the cloned ste gene on a plasmid causes yeast cells to overproduce dpapase a severalfold. a different cloned dna segment, which weakly suppresses the ste defects, causes overproduction of a heat labile activity (dpapase b) by about tenfold. other experiments indicate that dpapase a action may be rate limiting for alpha factor maturation in normal alpha cells.
