structure of saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha agglutinin. evidence for a yeast cell wall protein with multiple immunoglobulin like domains with atypical disulfides.. . alpha agglutinin of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a cell wall associated protein that mediates cell interaction in mating. although the mature protein includes about residues, the nh terminal half of the protein is sufficient for binding to its ligand a agglutinin. alpha agglutinin , a fully active fragment of the protein, has been purified and analyzed. circular dichroism spectroscopy, together with sequence alignments, suggest that alpha agglutinin consists of three immunoglobulin variable like domains. domain i, residues ; domain ii, residues ; and domain iii, residues . peptide sequencing data established the arrangement of the disulfide bonds in alpha agglutinin . cys is disulfide bonded to cys, forming an interdomain bond between domains i and ii. cys is bonded to cys, in an atypical intradomain disulfide bond between the a and f strands of domain iii. cys and cys have free sulfhydryls. sequencing also showed that at least two of three potential n glycosylation sites with sequence asn xaa thr are glycosylated. at least one of three asn xaa ser sequences is not glycosylated. no residues nh terminal to ser were o glycosylated, whereas ser, and all hydroxy amino acid residues cooh terminal to this position were modified. therefore o glycosylated ser and thr residues cluster in the cooh terminal region of domain iii, and the o glycosylation continues into a ser/thr rich sequence that extends from domain iii to the cooh terminal of the full length protein.
