a seven transmembrane rgs protein that modulates plant cell proliferation.. . g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) at the cell surface activate heterotrimeric g proteins by inducing the g protein alpha (galpha) subunit to exchange guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate. regulators of g protein signaling (rgs) proteins accelerate the deactivation of galpha subunits to reduce gpcr signaling. here we identified an rgs protein (atrgs) in arabidopsis that has a predicted structure similar to a gpcr as well as an rgs box with gtpase accelerating activity. expression of atrgs complemented the pheromone supersensitivity phenotype of a yeast rgs mutant, sstdelta. loss of atrgs increased the activity of the arabidopsis galpha subunit, resulting in increased cell elongation in hypocotyls in darkness and increased cell production in roots grown in light. these findings suggest that atrgs is a critical modulator of plant cell proliferation.
