pheromonal regulation and sequence of the saccharomyces cerevisiae sst gene. a model for desensitization to pheromone.. . strains of both haploid mating types containing sst mutations are altered in response to pheromone; mata sst cells are supersensitive to alpha factor, and mat alpha sst cells are supersensitive to a factor. this phenotype suggests that sst encodes a component of the pheromone response pathway that is common to both mating types. we have cloned the sst gene by isolation of multicopy plasmids that complement the sst mutation. one such plasmid contained a . kilobase hindiii fragment that was able to complement the sst mutation in high or low copy number, integrated at the sst locus, and resulted in an sst phenotype when disrupted, indicating that this fragment contained the sst gene. we identified the functional region of the complementing dna fragment by transposon mutagenesis. sequencing of this fragment identified an open reading frame encoding amino acids at a position that correlated well with the functional region. expression of an sst beta galactosidase fusion was haploid specific and induced by exposure to pheromone. we discuss a model in which induction of the sst product results in inhibition of a component of the pheromone response pathway, resulting in desensitization to pheromone.
