isolation and characterization of saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants supersensitive to g arrest by the mating hormone a factor.. . nine independent mutants which are supersensitive (ssl ) to g arrest by the mating hormone a factor were isolated by screening mutagenized saccharomyces cerevisiae mat alpha cells on solid medium for increased growth inhibition with a factor. these mutants carried lesions in two complementation groups, ssl and ssl. mutations at the ssl locus were mating type specific. mat alpha ssl cells were supersensitive to a factor but mata ssl were not supersensitive to alpha factor. in contrast, mutations at the ssl locus conferred supersensitivity to the mating hormone of the opposite mating type on both mat alpha and mata cells. the alpha cell specific capacity to inactivate externally added a factor was shown to be lacking in mat alpha ssl mutants whereas mat alpha ssl cells were able to inactivate a factor. complementation analysis showed that ssl and sst, a mutation originally isolated as conferring supersensitivity to alpha factor to mata cells, are lesions in the same gene. the ssl gene was mapped . centimorgans distal to ilv on chromosome xii.
