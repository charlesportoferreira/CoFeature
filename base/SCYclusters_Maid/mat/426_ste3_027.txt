alpha mating type specific expression of mutations leading to constitutive agglutinability in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . two mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae have been isolated and characterized. the mutants were constitutively agglutinable at degrees c, the temperature at which wild type cells agglutinate only after induction by mating pheromone. the mutant cells had other properties specific for the normal alpha cell type, i.e., conjugation with a cells, response to a mating pheromone, and production of alpha mating pheromone. the two mutations, cag and cag, were recessive and expressed only in alpha cells. cag is linked very closely to the mat locus, but cag is unlinked to the mat locus. these cag mutations complemented ste . these results indicate that cag genes are novel alpha specific genes involved in the regulation of sex agglutinin synthesis.
