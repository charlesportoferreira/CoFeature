the carboxy terminal segment of the yeast alpha factor receptor is a regulatory domain.. . the alpha factor receptor is rapidly hyperphosphorylated on thr and ser residues in its hydrophilic c terminal domain after cells are exposed to pheromone. mutant receptors in which this domain is altered or removed are biologically active and bind alpha factor with nearly normal affinity. however, cells expressing the mutant receptors are hypersensitive to pheromone action and appear to be defective in recovery from alpha factor induced growth arrest. mutant receptors with partial c terminal truncations undergo ligand induced endocytosis, suggesting that down regulation of receptor number is not the sole process for adaptation at the receptor level. a mutant receptor lacking the entire c terminal domain ( residues) does not display ligand induced endocytosis. genetic experiments indicate that the contribution of sst function to adaptation does not require the c terminal domain of the receptor.
