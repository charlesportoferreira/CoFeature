isolation and characterization of kar mutation in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have devised a direct screening method to isolate mutations in the kar gene, and have isolated a bip/kar mutant, kar , from saccharomyces cerevisiae as a small halo forming mutant of secreted mouse alpha amylase. the mutation site was identified as a point mutation at t to c resulting in the ile thr mutation of mature kar p, located at the most nh terminal first beta sheet structure (beta ) of the putative peptide binding domain. this isoleucine is highly conserved in the hsp family. by pulse chase experiments, no obvious difference was detected in the intracellular secretion rate of mf alpha prepro signal mouse alpha amylase between the wild type and the kar mutant. however, only about half the amount of secreted heterologous protein, mouse alpha amylase, was detected in the mutant culture medium compared with wild type. a smaller amount of homologous protein, alpha factor, was also detected and decreased faster in the mutant culture medium than in wild type. kar p was expressed about fold more than wild type karp, probably to cover its defective functions, and the turnover rates of karp and kar p were about the same in vivo. the purified kar p was slightly more sensitive to chymotryptic digestion than karp in vitro.
