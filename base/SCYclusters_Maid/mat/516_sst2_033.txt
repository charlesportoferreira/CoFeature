role of sst in modulating g protein coupled receptor signaling.. . sst formally acts as an inhibitor of g protein coupled receptor signaling in yeast perhaps stabilizing a g protein/unactivated receptor complex. destrp,ala alpha factor (dta alpha f), normally a competitive antagonist, activated responses in an sst strain. the antagonist to agonist switch was consistent with an sst effect on receptor/g protein coupling, but not with an sst role in global reduction of signaling. response to alpha factor, assayed by growth arrest, was independent of level of expressed surface receptor over a fold range in an sst+ strain, consistent with coupling of only a subset of receptors to g protein. in contrast, in an sst strain response to alpha factor was proportional to receptor expression, consistent with participation of all receptors in signaling. the wt alpha factor receptor inhibited signaling in response to dta alpha f when introduced into a ckc chimeric receptor strain. the dominant negative effect of the receptor might reflect sequestration of g protein.
