spontaneous receptor independent heterotrimeric g protein signalling in an rgs mutant.. . tripartite g protein coupled receptors (gpcrs) represent one of the largest groups of signal transducers, transmitting signals from hormones, neuropeptides, odorants, food and light. ligand bound receptors catalyse gdp/gtp exchange on the g protein alpha subunit (galpha), leading to alpha gtp separation from the betagamma subunits and pathway activation. activating mutations in the receptors or g proteins underlie many human diseases, including some cancers, dwarfism and premature puberty. regulators of g protein signalling (rgs proteins) are known to modulate the level and duration of ligand induced signalling by accelerating the intrinsic gtpase activity of the galpha subunit, and thus reformation of the inactive gdp bound galpha. here we find that even in the absence of receptor, mutation of the rgs family member sst (refs ) permits spontaneous activation of the g protein coupled mating pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae at levels normally seen only in the presence of ligand. our work demonstrates the occurrence of spontaneous tripartite g protein signalling in vivo and identifies a requirement for rgs proteins in preventing such receptor independent activation.
