cop signalosome components play a role in the mating pheromone response of s. cerevisiae.. . a family of genetically and structurally homologous complexes, the proteasome lid, cop signalosome (csn) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor , mediate different regulatory pathways. the csn functions in numerous eukaryotes as a regulator of development and signaling, yet until now no evidence for a complex has been found in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we identified a group of proteins, including a homolog of csn/jab and four uncharacterized pci components, that interact in a manner suggesting they form a complex analogous to the csn in s. cerevisiae. these newly identified subunits play a role in adaptation to pheromone signaling. deletants for individual subunits enhance pheromone response and increase mating efficiency. overexpression of individual subunits or a human homolog mitigates sst induced pheromone sensitivity. csi, a novel csn interactor, exhibits opposite phenotypes. deletants also accumulate cdc/cullin in a rub modified form; however, this role of the csn appears to be distinct from that in the mating pathway.
