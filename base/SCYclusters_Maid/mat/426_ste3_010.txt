dnm, a dynamin related gene, participates in endosomal trafficking in yeast.. . we identified dnm, a novel dynamin related gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae. molecular and genetic mapping showed that dnm is the most proximal gene to the right of centromere , and is predicted to encode a protein of kd, designated dnmp. the protein exhibits % overall identity with full length dynamin i and % identity with the most highly conserved amino acid gtpase region. our findings show that like mammalian dynamin, dnmp participates in endocytosis; however, it is unlikely to be a cognate homologue. cells with a disruption in the dnm gene showed mating response defects consistent with a delay in receptor mediated endocytosis. the half life of the step pheromone receptor was increased two to threefold in the dnm mutant, demonstrating that dnmp participates in the constitutive turnover of the receptor. to define the step in the endocytic pathway at which dnmp acts, we analyzed mutant strains at both early and late steps of the process. initial internalization of epitope tagged pheromone receptor or of labeled pheromone proceeded with wild type kinetics. however, delivery of the internalized receptor to the vacuole was greatly impeded during ligand induced endocytosis. these data suggest that during receptor mediated endocytosis, dnmp acts after internalization, but before fusion with the vacuole. the dnm mutant was not defective for sorting of vacuolar proteins, indicating that dnmp is not required for transport from the late endosome to the vacuole. therefore, we suggest that dnmp participates at a novel step before fusion with the late endosome.
