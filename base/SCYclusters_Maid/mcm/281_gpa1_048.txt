a g protein alpha subunit from asexual candida albicans functions in the mating signal transduction pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae and is regulated by the a alpha repressor.. . we have isolated a gene, designated cag, from candida albicans by using the g protein alpha subunit clone scg of saccharomyces cerevisiae as a probe. amino acid sequence comparison revealed that cag is more homologous to scg than to any other g protein reported so far. homology between cag and scg not only includes the conserved guanine nucleotide binding domains but also spans the normally variable regions which are thought to be involved in interaction with the components of the specific signal transduction pathway. furthermore, cag contains a central domain, previously found only in scg. cag null mutants of c. albicans created by gene disruption produced no readily detectable phenotype. the c. albicans cag gene complemented both the growth and mating defects of s. cerevisiae scg null mutants when carried on either a low or high copy number plasmid. in diploid c. albicans, the cag transcript was readily detectable in mycelial and yeast cells of both the white and opaque forms. however, the cag specific transcript in s. cerevisiae transformants containing the c. albicans cag gene was observed only in haploid cells. this transcription pattern matches that of scg in s. cerevisiae and is caused by a alpha mediated repression in diploid cells. that is, cag behaves as a haploid specific gene in s. cerevisiae, subject to control by the a alpha mating type regulation pathway. we infer from these results that c. albicans may have a signal transduction system analogous to that controlling mating type in s. cerevisiae or possibly even a sexual pathway that has so far remained undetected.
