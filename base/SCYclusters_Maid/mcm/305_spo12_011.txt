the replication fork block protein fob functions as a negative regulator of the fear network.. . background. the protein phosphatase cdc is a key regulator of exit from mitosis in budding yeast. its activation during anaphase is characterized by dissociation from its inhibitor cfi/net in the nucleolus and is controlled by two regulatory networks. the cdc early anaphase release (fear) network promotes activation of the phosphatase during early anaphase, whereas the mitotic exit network (men) activates cdc during late stages of anaphase. results. here we investigate how the fear network component spo regulates cdc activation. we identify the replication fork block protein fob as a spo interacting factor. inactivation of fob leads to premature release of cdc from the nucleolus in metaphase arrested cells. conversely, high levels of fob delay the release of cdc from the nucleolus. fob associates with cfi/net, and consistent with this observation, we find that the bulk of cdc localizes to the fob binding region within the rdna repeats. finally, we show that spo phosphorylation is cell cycle regulated and affects its binding to fob. conclusions. fob functions as a negative regulator of the fear network. we propose that fob helps to prevent the dissociation of cdc from cfi/net prior to anaphase and that spo activation during early anaphase promotes the release of cdc from its inhibitor by antagonizing fob function.
