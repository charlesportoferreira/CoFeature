molecular analysis of the pho gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the pho gene product is a positive regulatory factor required for the synthesis of the phosphate repressible acid phosphatase (encoded by the pho gene) in saccharomyces cerevisiae. genetic analysis has suggested that pho may be the signal acceptor molecule; however, the biochemical function of the pho gene product is not known. we have cloned the pho gene and sequenced the promoter. a pho lacz fusion was shown to be a valid reporter since its expression is regulated by the level of inorganic phosphate and is controlled by the same regulatory factors that regulate pho expression. to elucidate the mechanism by which pho functions, we have isolated and cloned dominant mutations in the pho gene which confer constitutive synthesis of acid phosphatase. we have demonstrated that overexpression of the negative regulatory factor, pho, but not the negative regulatory factor pho, partially blocks the constitutive acid phosphatase synthesis in a strain containing a dominant constitutive allele of pho. this suggests that pho may function by interacting with pho or that these molecules compete for the same target.
