n myristoylation is required for function of the pheromone responsive g alpha protein of yeast. conditional activation of the pheromone response by a temperature sensitive n myristoyl transferase.. . in a screen designed to identify novel mutations in the mating response pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated conditional alleles of nmt, the gene encoding n myristoyl transferase. genetic data indicate that nmt deficiency results in the activation of the pheromone response at the level of gpa, the alpha subunit of the pheromone responsive g protein. we show that gpa is myristoylated by nmt, and without this normally stable modification, gpa is unable to inhibit pheromone signaling. this loss of gpa function is probably not the result of improper subcellular localization. unlike the mammalian g alpha i proteins alpha i and alpha o, nonmyristoylated gpa is able to associate with membranes. in addition to gpa, our data indicate that nmt myristoylates other proteins essential to vegetative growth.
