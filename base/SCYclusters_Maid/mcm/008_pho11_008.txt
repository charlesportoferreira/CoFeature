isolation and characterization of a mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae affected in the flo locus.. . a non flocculent strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected after ems mutation of a flocculent and heterozygous flo locus diploid. the analysis of asci from this diploid showed in all cases segregation f.nf, thus confirming that it was probably affected in the desired gene. after sporulation and dissection of asci, three haploid strains were chosen, which were altered in the locus flo. crossing these three strains with two other ones having markers for ade and pho.leu, we could map the mutation at ca. . cm and ca. . cm from the pho and ade loci respectively.
