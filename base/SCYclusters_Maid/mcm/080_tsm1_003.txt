tafs revisited. more data reveal new twists and confirm old ideas.. . synthesis of messenger rna by rna polymerase ii requires the combined activities of more than polypeptides. coordinating the interaction of these proteins is the basal transcription factor tfiid, which recognizes the core promoter and supplies a scaffolding upon which the rest of the transcriptional machinery can assemble. a multisubunit complex, tfiid consists of the tata binding protein (tbp) and several tbp associated factors (tafs), whose primary sequences are well conserved from yeast to humans. data from reconstituted cell free transcription systems and binary interaction assays suggest that the taf subunits can function as promoter recognition factors, as coactivators capable of transducing signals from enhancer bound activators to the basal machinery, and even as enzymatic modifiers of other proteins. whether tafs function similarly in vivo, however, has been an open question. initial characterization of yeast bearing mutations in particular tafs seemingly indicated that, unlike the situation in vitro, tafs played only a minor role in transcriptional regulation in vivo. however, reconsideration of this data in light of more recent results from yeast and other organisms reveals considerable convergence between the models derived from in vitro experiments and those derived from in vivo studies. in particular, there is an emerging consensus that tafs represent one of several classes of coactivators that participate in transcriptional activation in vivo.
