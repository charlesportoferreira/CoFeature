a novel zinc finger is required for mcm homocomplex assembly.. . mcm is a dna replication factor that interacts with multiple subunits of the mcm hexameric complex. we report here that mcm self interacts and assembles into large homocomplexes (approximately kda). a conserved domain of amino acid residues is sufficient for mediating self interaction and complex assembly. a novel zinc finger within the conserved domain, cxcxcxh, is essential for the homocomplex formation. mutant alleles with amino acid substitutions at conserved cysteines and histidine in the zinc finger fail to assemble homocomplexes. a defect in homocomplex assembly correlates with defects in dna replication and cell growth in the mutants. these observations suggest that homocomplex assembly is essential for mcm function. multisubunit mcm homocomplexes may provide the structural basis for mcm to interact with multiple subunits of the mcm hexamer.
