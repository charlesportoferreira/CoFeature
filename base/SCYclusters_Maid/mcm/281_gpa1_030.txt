evidence that mating by the saccharomyces cerevisiae gpaval mutant occurs through the default mating pathway and a suggestion of a role for ubiquitin mediated proteolysis.. . the yeast g alpha subunit, gpap, plays a negative role in the pheromone response pathway. the gpaval mutant was previously shown to have a growth defect, consistent with the gtpase defect predicted for this mutation, and greatly reduced mating. various explanations for the mating defect have been proposed. one approach to analyze the gpaval mating defect involved epistasis analysis. the low mating of the gpaval mutant was independent of the pheromone receptor; therefore, it results from intracellular activation of the pathway, consistent with a gtpase defect. this result suggests that gpaval mating occurs through the default rather than the chemotropic pathway involved in pheromone response. we therefore tested the effect of a spa mutation on gpaval mating, because spap has been implicated in the default pathway. the spa mutation greatly reduced the mating of the gpaval mutant, suggesting that gpaval mating occurs predominantly through the default pathway. in a second approach to investigate the gpaval phenotypes, suppressors of the gpaval mating defect were isolated. two suppressor genes corresponded to son/ufd and sen, which are implicated in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. on the basis of these results, we suggest that a positive component of the default mating pathway is subject to ubiquitin mediated degradation.
