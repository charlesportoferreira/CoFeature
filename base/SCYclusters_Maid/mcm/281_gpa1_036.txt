isolation of a gene encoding a g protein alpha subunit involved in the regulation of camp levels in the yeast kluyveromyces lactis.. . using chromosomal dna from kluyveromyces lactis as template and oligodeoxynucleotides designed from conserved regions of various g protein alpha subunits we were able to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction two products of approximately . kb (p ) and . kb (p ). sequencing showed that these two fragments share high homology with genes coding for the g alpha subunits from different sources. using the p fragment as a probe we screened a genomic library from k. lactis and we cloned a gene (klgpa) whose deduced amino acid sequence showed, depending on the exact alignment, % similarity and % identity with gpap and % similarity and % identity with gpap, the g protein alpha subunits from saccharomyces cerevisiae. klgpa is a single copy gene and its disruption rendered viable cells with significantly reduced camp level, indicating that this g alpha subunit may be involved in regulating the adenylyl cyclase activity, rather than participating in the mating pheromone response pathway. klgpap shares some structural similarities with members of the mammalian g alpha s family (stimulatory of adenylyl cyclase) including the absence in its n terminus of a myristoyl modification sequence.
