the klgpa gene encodes a g protein alpha subunit that is a positive control element in the mating pathway of the budding yeast kluyveromyces lactis.. . the cloning of the gene encoding the klgpap subunit was achieved by standard pcr techniques and by screening a kluyveromyces lactis genomic library using the pcr product as a probe. the full length open reading frame spans , nucleotides including the stop codon. the deduced primary structure of the protein ( amino acid residues) strongly resembles that of gpap, the g protein alpha subunit from saccharomyces cerevisiae involved in the mating pheromone response pathway. nevertheless, unlike disruption of gpa from s. cerevisiae, disruption of klgpa rendered viable cells with a reduced capacity to mate. expression of a plasmidic klgpa copy in a deltaklgpa mutant restores full mating competence; hence we conclude that klgpap plays a positive role in the mating pathway. overexpression of the constitutive subunit klgpap(k()) (gtp bound) does not induce constitutive mating; instead it partially blocks wild type mating and is unable to reverse the sterile phenotype of deltaklgpa mutant cells. k. lactis expresses a second galpha subunit, klgpap, which is involved in regulating cyclic amp levels upon glucose stimulation. this subunit does not rescue deltaklgpa cells from sterility; instead, overproduction of klgpap slightly reduces the mating of wild type cells, suggesting cross talk within the pheromone response pathway mediated by klgpap and glucose metabolism mediated by klgpap. the deltaklgpa deltaklgpa double mutant, although viable, showed the mating deficiency observed in the single deltaklgpa mutant.
