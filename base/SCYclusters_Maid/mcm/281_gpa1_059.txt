the ste and ste genes of yeast encode potential beta and gamma subunits of the mating factor receptor coupled g protein.. . the ste and ste genes are required for haploid yeast cell mating. sequencing of the cloned genes revealed that the ste polypeptide shows extensive homology to the beta subunits of mammalian g proteins, while the ste polypeptide shows weak similarity to the gamma subunit of transducin. null mutations in either gene can suppress the haploid specific cell cycle arrest caused by mutations in the scg gene (previously shown to encode a protein with similarity to the alpha subunit of g proteins). we propose that the products of the ste and ste genes comprise the beta and gamma subunits of a g protein complex coupled to the mating pheromone receptors. the genetic data suggest pheromone receptor binding leads to the dissociation of the alpha subunit from beta gamma (as shown for mammalian g proteins), and the free beta gamma element initiates the pheromone response.
