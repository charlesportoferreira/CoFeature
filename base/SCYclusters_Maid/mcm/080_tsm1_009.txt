identification and characterization of a tfiid like multiprotein complex from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . although the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by rna polymerase ii are apparently highly conserved from yeast to man, the identification of a yeast tata binding protein (tbp) tbp associated factor (tafii) complex comparable to the metazoan tfiid component of the basal transcriptional machinery has remained elusive. here, we report the isolation of a yeast tbp tafii complex which can mediate transcriptional activation by gal vp in a highly purified yeast in vitro transcription system. we have cloned and sequenced the genes encoding four of the multiple yeast tafii proteins comprising the tbp tafii multisubunit complex and find that they are similar at the amino acid level to both human and drosophila tfiid subunits. using epitope tagging and immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate that these genes encode bona fide taf proteins and show that the yeast tbp tafii complex is minimally composed of tbp and seven distinct ytafii proteins ranging in size from m(r) = , to m(r) = ,. in addition, by constructing null alleles of the cloned taf encoding genes, we show that normal function of the taf encoding genes is essential for yeast cell viability.
