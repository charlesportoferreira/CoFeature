mutations in a gene encoding the alpha subunit of a saccharomyces cerevisiae g protein indicate a role in mating pheromone signaling.. . mutations which allowed conjugation by saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking a mating pheromone receptor gene were selected. one of the genes defined by such mutations was isolated from a yeast genomic library by complementation of a temperature sensitive mutation and is identical to the gene gpa (also known as scg), recently shown to be highly homologous to genes encoding the alpha subunits of mammalian g proteins. physiological analysis of temperature sensitive gpa mutations suggests that the encoded g protein is involved in signaling in response to mating pheromones. mutational disruption of g protein activity causes cell cycle arrest in g, deposition of mating specific cell surface agglutinins, and induction of pheromone specific mrnas, all of which are responses to pheromone in wild type cells. in addition, mutants can conjugate without the benefit of mating pheromone or pheromone receptor. a model is presented where the activated g protein has a negative impact on a constitutive signal which normally keeps the pheromone response repressed.
