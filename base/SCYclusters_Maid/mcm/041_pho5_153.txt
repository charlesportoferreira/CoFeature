a deletion that includes the segment coding for the signal peptidase cleavage site delays release of saccharomyces cerevisiae acid phosphatase from the endoplasmic reticulum.. . we studied ultrastructural localization of acid phosphatase in derepressed saccharomyces cerevisiae cells transformed with a multicopy plasmid carrying either the wild type pho gene or a pho gene deleted in the region overlapping the signal peptidase cleavage site. wild type enzyme was located in the cell wall, as was % of the modified protein, which carried high mannose sugar chains. the remaining % of the protein was active and core glycosylated, and it accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. the signal peptide remained uncleaved in both forms. cells expressing the modified protein exhibited an exaggerated endoplasmic reticulum with dilated lumen.
