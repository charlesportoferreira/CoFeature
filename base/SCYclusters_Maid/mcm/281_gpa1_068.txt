activator of g protein signaling is a guanine dissociation inhibitor for galpha i subunits.. . activator of g protein signaling (ags) is a newly identified protein shown to act at the level of the g protein itself. ags belongs to the goloco family of proteins, sharing the aa goloco motif that is a galpha(i/o) binding motif. ags interacts only with members of the galpha(i/o) subfamily. by surface plasmon resonance, we found that ags binds exclusively to the gdp bound form of galpha(i). in gtpgammas binding assays, ags behaves as a guanine dissociation inhibitor (gdi), inhibiting the rate of exchange of gdp for gtp by galpha(i). ags interacts with both galpha(i) and galpha(o) subunits, but has gdi activity only on galpha(i), not on galpha(o). the fourth goloco motif of ags is a major contributor to this activity. ags stabilizes galpha(i) in its gdp bound form, as it inhibits the increase in tryptophan fluorescence of the galpha(i) gdp subunit stimulated by alf()( ). ags is widely expressed as it is detected by immunoblotting in brain, testis, liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, and in pc cells. several different sizes of the protein are detected. by northern blotting, ags shows . kb and . kb mrnas in heart and brain, respectively, suggesting tissue specific alternative splicing. taken together, our results demonstrate that ags is a gdi. to the best of our knowledge, no other gdi has been described for heterotrimeric g proteins. inhibition of the galpha subunit and stimulation of heterotrimeric g protein signaling, presumably by stimulating gbetagamma, extend the possibilities for modulating signal transduction through heterotrimeric g proteins.
