mating pheromone induced expression of the mat pm gene of schizosaccharomyces pombe. identification of signalling components and characterization of upstream controlling elements.. . transcription of the mat pm gene of schizosaccharomyces pombe controlling entry into meiosis is stimulated by the mating pheromone, m factor. we have studied its expression by monitoring beta galactosidase activity in cells carrying a plasmid borne mat pm/lacz fusion construct. stimulation required the m factor receptor (map) and other proteins (gpa, byr, byr and spk) thought to be involved in propagating the pheromone signal within the cell. mutational activation of gpa encoding an alpha subunit of the receptor coupled heterotrimeric g protein causes full expression of mat pm even in the absence of pheromone, suggesting that gpa is a key signal transmitter. furthermore, an activated rasval mutant exhibited a much stronger level of induction than wild type cells, though full expression needs m factor treatment. deletion analysis of the mat pm promoter region identified a stretch of bp that is shown to play a critical role in controlling expression. this region lies just upstream of a tata like box and contains a tr box (ttctttgtty) motif which is the recognition site of a putative transcription factor ste. point mutations in the tr box motif abolished the expression of mat pm/lacz. almost no expression of mat pm was detected in a ste deletion mutant, whereas overproduction of ste greatly increased the expression.
