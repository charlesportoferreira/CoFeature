a cdc like autolytic saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant altered in budding site selection is complemented by spo, a sporulation gene.. . lyt is an essential gene for the growth and morphogenesis of saccharomyces cerevisiae. a detailed characterization of mutants carrying the lyt allele showed that this mutation was recessive and pleiotropic, affecting both mitotic and meiotic functions. at the nonpermissive temperature of degrees c, lyt haploid strains budded at a distal position (instead of an axial one, as in wild type haploid strains) and underwent autolysis when the buds were almost the size of the mother cells. these mitotic alterations in cell stability and budding topology were dependent on growth and protein synthesis. autolysis was prevented by inhibiting dna synthesis (with hydroxyurea) or by blocking the assembly of microtubules (with benomyl), suggesting that loss of cell viability must occur at a fixed mitotic cycle stage after dna synthesis and mitotic spindle assembly. on the other hand, lyt /lyt diploids failed to sporulate at both and degrees c. taking into account these characteristics, the lyt mutant could be considered a cdc like mutant. by genetic transformation of an appropriate lyt strain with a genomic library, ligated to the multicopy vector yep, we isolated a gene capable of complementing mitotic alterations but not the meiotic defect. this was the sporulation specific gene spo, which is expressed under the control of the locus mat in meiosis and is also expressed in the mitotic cycle (v. parkes and l. h. johnston, nucleic acids res. . , ). a significant level of spo mrna can be detected when this gene is inserted in a multicopy plasmid.
