involvement of the saccharomyces cerevisiae uth gene in the oxidative stress response.. . the uth gene was identified by screening a saccharomyces cerevisiae promoter probe gene bank for oxidative stress responsive genes. transcription of uth was decreased by the superoxide anion and increased by hydrogen peroxide. deletion of uth did not affect the growth of grande cells, however in a rho background it caused retarded growth. the uth mutant showed increased resistance to peroxides and, in contrast, was sensitive to superoxide or the thiol oxidant diamide. furthermore, the mutant exhibited increased survival under starvation conditions, with elevated levels of dormant cells in starved cell cultures. a multicopy plasmid containing the first half of the orf could confer increased resistance to superoxide and increased sensitivity to peroxides/diamide/starvation on wild type cells. the same plasmid in the uth background caused a highly increased mortality.
