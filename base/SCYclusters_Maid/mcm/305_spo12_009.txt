a new mapping method employing a meiotic rec mutant of yeast.. . a rapid new mapping method has been developed for localizing a dominant or recessive mutation to a particular chromosome of yeast. the procedure utilizes the ability of strains homozygous for the spo mutation to undergo chromosome segregation without appreciable recombination during sporulation. the level of sporulation in spo /spo diploids is reduced and asci are often immature or abnormal in appearance; spore viability is less than %. the first step of the mapping procedure is the construction of a haploid spo strain carrying a recessive drug resistance marker and the unmapped mutation(s). this strain is crossed to a set of three spo mapping tester strains containing, among them, a recessive marker on each chromosome. the resulting spo /spo diploids are sporulated and plated on drug containing medium. viable meiotic products that express the drug resistance marker due to chromosome haploidization are selectively recovered. these meiotic products are haploid for most, but generally not all, chromosomes. the level of disomy for individual chromosomes averages %. each of the recessive chromosomal markers is expressed in approximately a third of the drug resistant segregants. ninety eight percent of these segregants show no evidence of intergenic recombination. thus, two markers located on the same chromosome, but on different homologs, are virtually never expressed in the same drug resistant clone. the utility of this mapping procedure is demonstrated by confirming the chromosomal location of seven known markers, as well as by the assignment of a previously unmapped mutation, spo , to chromosome viii. in addition, the analysis of the products of spo meiosis indicates that several markers previously assigned to either chromosome xiv or chromosome xvii are actually on the same chromosome.
