identification of two novel taf subunits of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae tfiid complex.. . using a combination of ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography we have purified the general transcription initiation factor tfiid to near homogeneity from saccharomyces cerevisiae. yeast tfiid is composed of tbp, the tata box binding protein, and distinct tbp associated factors (tafs), which range in size from to kda. twelve of the taf subunits have been previously identified, but two, tafp and tafp, are novel. tafp exhibits significant sequence similarity to the conserved c terminal region of drosophila tafp, human tafp, and human tafp and is encoded by a previously identified gene mpt. tafp shows no significant sequence homology to any previously identified tafp. the genes encoding tafp and tafp are single copy and essential for normal yeast cell growth. furthermore, neither tafp nor tafp are associated with the histone acetylase spt ada gcn complex or other non tfiid tbf.taf complexes. the significance of these results in terms of tfiid structure, function, and organization is discussed.
