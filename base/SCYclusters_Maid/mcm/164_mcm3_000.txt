mcm is polyubiquitinated during mitosis before establishment of the pre replication complex.. . to ensure fidelity in genome duplication, eukaryotes restrict dna synthesis to once every cell division by a cascade of regulated steps. central to this cascade is the periodic assembly of the hexameric mcm complex at replication origins. however, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, only a fraction of each mcm protein is able to assemble into hexamers and associate with replication origins during m phase, suggesting that mcm complex assembly and recruitment may be regulated post translationally. here we show that a small fraction of mcmp is polyubiquitinated at the onset of mcm complex assembly. reducing the rate of ubiquitination by uba , a suppressor of mcm , restored the interaction of mcm p with subunits of the mcm complex and its recruitment to the replication origin. possible roles for ubiquitinated mcmp in the assembly of the mcm complex at replication origins are discussed.
