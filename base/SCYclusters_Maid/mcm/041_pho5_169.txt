regulation of chromatin remodeling by inositol polyphosphates.. . chromatin remodeling is required for efficient transcription of eukaryotic genes. in a genetic selection for budding yeast mutants that were defective in induction of the phosphate responsive pho gene, we identified mutations in arg/ipk, which encodes a nuclear inositol polyphosphate kinase. in arg mutant strains, remodeling of pho promoter chromatin is impaired, and the adenosine triphosphate dependent chromatin remodeling complexes swi/snf and ino are not efficiently recruited to phosphate responsive promoters. these results suggest a role for the small molecule inositol polyphosphate in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcription.
