study of the carbohydrate part of yeast acid phosphatase.. . it has been found that the carbohydrate part of acid phosphatase from yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae consists of n glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains containing from to about mannose units. the presence of very small amounts of o glycosidically linked chains was indicated. acetolysis studies pointed to a high similarity in the structure of acid phosphatase and mannan carbohydrate chains. a new method is described for cross linking of acid phosphatase specifically via carbohydrate chains. the possibility to cross link the enzyme subunits intramolecularly is in accordance with the suggestion that carbohydrate chains play a role in subunit associations.
