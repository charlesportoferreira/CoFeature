identification of a nuclear pheromone sensitive protein kinase not identical to pcdc in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . nuclei of saccharomyces cerevisiae cells contain a protein kinase, the activity of which is drastically reduced in response to an activation of the mating signal pathway by pheromone. inhibition of this pheromone sensitive kinase is also observed under conditions of constitutive activation of the signal pathway in a temperature sensitive cdc mutant. the enzyme, which by sds page has a molecular mass of , da, is a protein serine kinase that phosphorylates several endogenous substrates in nuclear extracts. the activity of this kinase is temperature resistant in a temperature sensitive cdc mutant, indicating that it is not identical to pcdc, the catalytic component of the cell cycle protein kinase complex.
