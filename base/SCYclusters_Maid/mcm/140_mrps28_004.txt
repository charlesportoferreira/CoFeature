structural and functional analyses of a yeast mitochondrial ribosomal protein homologous to ribosomal protein s of escherichia coli.. . we have purified a small subunit mitochondrial ribosomal protein, mrpsp, from the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae. sequence from the amino terminus of mrpsp was used to design a degenerate oligonucleotide that was complementary to the mrps gene. the mrps gene was isolated and its sequence determined. the mrps sequence encodes a kda protein that has a region of homology with ribosomal protein s of e. coli. this region spans the entire length of the e. coli protein, but as mrpsp is larger, includes only the portion of the mrpsp sequence from amino acids to . based on this homology, we predict that mrpsp, like e. coli s, interacts directly with small subunit rrna and functions as an early protein in ribosome assembly. cells carrying a disrupted chromosomal copy of mrps are unable to respire and spontaneously lose portions of their mitochondrial genomes at a high frequency. these phenotypes are consistent with an essential role for mrpsp in the assembly and/or function of the mitochondrial ribosome.
