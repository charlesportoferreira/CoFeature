multiple global regulators control his transcription in yeast.. . gene expression is dependent on the interaction of dna binding factors with distinct promoter control elements to activate rna synthesis. the expression of the his gene in yeast is under two different control systems. one of these, general amino acid control, involves a dna binding protein, gcn, that stimulates transcription in response to amino acid starvation by binding to ' tgactc ' sequences in the his promoter region. a second system, the basal level control, stimulates his transcription in the absence of amino acid starvation. the basal level transcription of the his gene is under the control of two genes, bas and bas, which are also required for the control of purine biosynthesis. in addition, bas is required for the utilization of organic phosphates in the growth medium. genetic mapping and dna sequence analysis show that bas is pho, a gene previously identified as a regulator of phosphate metabolism. direct biochemical analysis shows that the bas gene encodes a protein that binds to both the his and pho promoters. the involvement of a single dna binding protein in the regulation of histidine, adenine, and phosphate metabolism suggests that yeast may use a few key dna binding proteins to coordinate the regulation of diverse metabolic pathways.
