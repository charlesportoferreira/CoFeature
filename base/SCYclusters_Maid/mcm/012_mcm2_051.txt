the fission yeast cdc+ gene encodes a member of the mcm family of replication proteins.. . we have cloned and characterized the fission yeast cdc+ gene. we demonstrate that it encodes a structural homologue of the budding yeast mcm protein. in fission yeast, the cdc+ gene is constitutively expressed, and essential for viability. deletion delays progression through s phase, and cells arrest in the first cycle with an apparent c dna content, with their checkpoint control intact. the temperature sensitive cdc p mutation is synthetically lethal with cdc m. in addition, we show by classical and molecular genetics that cdc+ is allelic to the nda+ locus. we conclude that cdcp plays a potentially conserved role in s phase.
