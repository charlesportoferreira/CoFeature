identification and characterization of ussp (sdbp). a novel u snrna associated protein with significant similarity to core proteins of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins.. . the sdb gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated in a search for high copy number suppressors of mutations in a cell cycle gene, dbf, sdb encodes a , da protein with significant sequence similarity to characterized mammalian snrnp core proteins. examination of multiple sequence alignments of snrnp core proteins with sdbp indicates that all of these proteins share a number of highly conserved residues, and identifies a novel motif for snrnp core proteins. sdbp is essential for cell viability and is required for nuclear pre mrna splicing both in vivo and in vitro. extracts prepared from sdbp depleted cells are unable to support splicing and have vastly reduced levels of u snrna. the stability of u, u, u and u spliceosomal snrnas is not affected by the loss of sdbp. antibodies raised against sdbp strongly coimmunoprecipitate free u snrna and u/u base paired snrnas. these results establish that sdb encodes a novel u snrna associated protein that is essential for the stability of u snrna. we therefore propose the more logical name uss (u six snrnp) for this gene.
