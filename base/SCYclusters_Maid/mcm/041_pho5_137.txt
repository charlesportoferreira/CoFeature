characterization of the gene for fructose , bisphosphatase from saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe. sequence, protein homology, and expression during growth on glucose.. . we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene for fructose , bisphosphatase from both saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe. the predicted protein sequence for fructose , bisphosphatase from s. cerevisiae contains amino acids and has a molecular weight of ,; that from s. pombe, contains amino acids and has a molecular weight of ,. comparison of these amino acid sequences with each other and that of pig kidney fructose , bisphosphatase shows several regions of strong homology separated by regions of divergence. these homologous regions are likely candidates for functional domains. a gene cassette was constructed for fructose , bisphosphatase from s. cerevisiae and the gene cassette expressed from the regulated pho and gal promoters of yeast. yeast cells expressing fructose , bisphosphatase, while growing on glucose, accumulated large amounts of enzyme intracellularly, suggesting that glucose regulated proteolytic inactivation does not operate efficiently under these conditions. growth on glucose was not inhibited by the expression of fructose , bisphosphatase.
