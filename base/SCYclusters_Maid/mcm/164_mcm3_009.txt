expression, phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the human p protein, a homologue of the yeast mcm replication protein.. . the human protein p belongs to a newly discovered class of mammalian nuclear proteins with high sequence homology to yeast replication proteins. we present the entire amino acid sequence of the human protein p as predicted from the cdna sequence, and show that p shares three central regions of high sequence similarity (about %) and a highly hydrophilic carboxy terminal region with the yeast mcm replication protein. the human genome most probably contains one p gene which is activated when hela cells progress to s phase, as shown by a several fold increase in p specific mrna. however, the amounts of p protein do not detectably change during this period, but p protein becomes phosphorylated at the beginning of s phase. in contrast to the yeast mcm proteins, which disappear from nuclei after initiation of dna replication, protein p remains in the nucleus during and after s phase. p is dispersed in mitotic cells and may be excluded from binding to chromosomes.
