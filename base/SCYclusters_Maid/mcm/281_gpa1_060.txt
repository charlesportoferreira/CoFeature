constitutive mutants in the yeast pheromone response. ordered function of the gene products.. . the alpha factor pheromone inhibits the division of yeast a cells. a general method was developed for isolating mutants that exhibit constitutive activation of the pheromone response pathway. a dominant allele of the ste locus was recovered in addition to recessive mutations in the scg gene. scg and ste are known to encode g alpha and g beta homologs, respectively. analysis of double mutants suggests that the ste gene product functions after the scg product but before the ste product.
