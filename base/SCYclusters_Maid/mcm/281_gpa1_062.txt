isolation of a second yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae gene (gpa) coding for guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein. studies on its structure and possible functions.. . in a previous paper, we demonstrated that a gene coding for a protein homologous to the alpha subunit of mammalian guanine nucleotide binding regulatory (g) proteins occurs in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the gene, designated gpa, encodes a protein (gp alpha) of amino acids with a calculated mr of ,. here we report the isolation of another g protein homologous gene, gpa, which encodes an amino acid sequence of amino acid residues with a mr of ,. the predicted primary structure of the gpa encoded protein (gp alpha) is homologous to mammalian g proteins [inhibitory and stimulatory g proteins (gi and gs, respectively), a g protein of unknown function (go), and transducins (gt)] as well as yeast gp alpha. when aligned with the alpha subunit of gi (gi alpha) to obtain maximal homology, gp alpha was found to contain a stretch of additional amino acid residues near the nh terminus. the gene was mapped in chromosome v, close to the centromere. haploid cells carrying a disrupted gpa gene are viable. cells carrying a high copy number of plasmid gpa (yepgpa) had markedly elevated levels of camp and could suppress a temperature sensitive mutation of ras. these results suggest that gpa may be involved in the regulation of camp levels in s. cerevisiae.
