sedp is a major cell wall protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae in the stationary phase and is involved in lytic enzyme resistance.. . a kda structural cell wall protein was purified from sodium dodecyl sulfate treated cell walls of saccharomyces cerevisiae by incubation with rarobacter faecitabidus protease i, which is a yeast lytic enzyme. amino acid sequence analysis revealed that this protein is the product of the sed gene. sed was formerly identified as a multicopy suppressor of erd, which encodes a protein involved in retrieval of luminal endoplasmic reticulum proteins from the secretory pathway. sedp is very rich in threonine and serine and, like other structural cell wall proteins, contains a putative signal sequence for the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. however, the fact that sedp, unlike other cell wall proteins, has six cysteines and seven putative n glycosylation sites suggests that sedp belongs to a new family of cell wall proteins. epitope tagged sedp was detected in a beta , glucanase extract of cell walls by immunoblot analysis, suggesting that sedp is a glucanase extractable cell wall protein. the expression of sedp mrna increased in the stationary phase and was accompanied by an increase in the sedp content of cell walls. disruption of sed had no effect on exponentially growing cells but made stationary phase cells sensitive to zymolyase. these results indicate that sedp is a major structural cell wall protein in stationary phase cells and is required for lytic enzyme resistance.
