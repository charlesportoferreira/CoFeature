cooperative functions of the mannoprotein encoding genes in the biogenesis and maintenance of the cell wall in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . to elucidate the roles of genes involved in the cell wall biogenesis and function in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated and characterized mutants that were lethal in a strain in which the sed gene encoding a cell wall mannoprotein was disrupted. thus, double mutants of sed and either mnn or mnn were unable to grow and yolc on a multicopy plasmid could suppress their synthetic lethality. a yolcp gfp fusion protein was found to localize to the cell wall, suggesting that it might also be a cell wall mannoprotein. subsequently, we analysed the effects of the shut off of sed in a sed and mnn double mutant. cells after the shut off showed anomalous cellular morphology and died in the mitotic m phase. from these and other results, we postulate that these genes function cooperatively with each other and in a cell cycle dependent manner in the biogenesis and maintenance of cell wall in s. cerevisiae. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
