the human tfiid components taf(ii) and taf(ii) and the yeast saga components ada and taf(ii) heterodimerize to form histone like pairs.. . it has been previously proposed that the transcription complexes tfiid and saga comprise a histone octamer like substructure formed from a heterotetramer of h like human htaf(ii) (or its drosophila melanogaster dtaf(ii) and yeast [saccharomyces cerevisiae] ytaf(ii) homologues) and h like htaf(ii) (dtaf(ii) and ytaf(ii)) along with two homodimers of hb like htaf(ii) (dtaf(ii)alpha and ytaf(ii)/). however, it has not been formally shown that htaf(ii) heterodimerizes via its histone fold. by two hybrid analysis with yeast and biochemical characterization of complexes formed by coexpression in escherichia coli, we showed that htaf(ii) does not homodimerize but heterodimerizes with htaf(ii). heterodimerization requires the alpha and alpha helices of the htaf(ii) histone fold and is abolished by mutations in the hydrophobic face of the htaf(ii) alpha helix. interaction with htaf(ii) requires a domain of htaf(ii) which shows sequence homology to ha. this domain also shows homology to the yeast saga component ada, and we show that yada heterodimerizes with the histone fold region of ytaf(ii)/, the yeast htaf(ii) homologue. these results are indicative of a histone fold type of interaction between htaf(ii) htaf(ii) and ytaf(ii) yada, which therefore constitute novel histone like pairs in the tfiid and saga complexes.
