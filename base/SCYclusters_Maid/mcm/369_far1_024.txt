the yeast cell cycle. positive and negative controls.. . cell cycle control in saccharomyces cerevisiae is exerted mainly at the start point in the g phase of the cycle. at this point, yeast cells check physiological signals and external parameters such as nutrient availability or the presence of sexual pheromones, before proceeding to next stages of the cycle. g cyclins regulate start by activating cdc, the p protein kinase, involving physical association between the cyclin and the kinase catalytic subunit. as a consequence of the accumulation and subsequent degradation of g cyclins, a peak of p protein kinase activity is reached before start, which would regulate the pass through this point by phosphorylating specific substrates. here we review the molecular aspects of start and the mechanisms, both positive and negative, that regulate this cell cycle point. we also describe a new gene that links nutrient availability to g cyclin expression and the possible connections with the ras camp pathway.
