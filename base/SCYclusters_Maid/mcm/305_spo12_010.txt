recombination and chromosome segregation during the single division meiosis in spo and spo diploids.. . this paper reports a study of chromosome segregation and recombination during sporulation of spo and spo diploid strains of s. cerevisiae. these strains undergo a single division to form asci containing two diploid or near diploid spores. the segregation of centromere linked markers in the two spored (dyad) products indicates that the division is generally equational. however, in a small percentage of the spo and spo cells, it appears that a meiosis i like division occurs. aberrant segregation of the mat locus on chromosome iii, yielding a monosomic and a trisomic spores pair, occurs in % of all dyads. the segregation patterns of markers at various distances from their centromeres and several pairs of markers on the same chromosome indicate that recombination takes place in both strains at nearly standard meiotic levels.
