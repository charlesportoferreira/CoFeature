fus phosphorylates multiple components of the mating signal transduction cascade. evidence for ste and far.. . the mitogen activated protein (map) kinase homologue fus mediates both transcription and g arrest in a pheromone induced signal transduction cascade in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we report an in vitro kinase assay for fus and its use in identifying candidate substrates. the assay requires catalytically active fus and pheromone induction. ste, a map kinase kinase homologue, is needed for maximal activity. at least seven proteins that specifically associate with fus are phosphorylated in the assay. many of these substrates are physiologically relevant and are affected by in vivo levels of numerous signal transduction components. one substrate is likely to be the transcription factor ste. a second is likely to be far, a protein required for g arrest. far was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of a nonarresting fus mutant and interacts with fus in a two hybrid system. consistent with this far is a good substrate in vitro and generates a fus associated substrate of expected size. these data support a model in which fus mediates transcription and g arrest by direct activation of ste and far and phosphorylates many other proteins involved in the response to pheromone.
