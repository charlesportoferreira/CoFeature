dual lipid modification motifs in g(alpha) and g(gamma) subunits are required for full activity of the pheromone response pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . to establish the biological function of thioacylation (palmitoylation), we have studied the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (g protein) subunits of the pheromone response pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the yeast g protein gamma subunit (step) is unusual among g(gamma) subunits because it is farnesylated at cysteine and has the potential to be thioacylated at cysteine . substitution of either cysteine results in a strong signaling defect. in this study, we found that step is thioacylated at cysteine , which depended on prenylation of cysteine . step was targeted to the plasma membrane even in the absence of prenylation or thioacylation. however, g protein activation released prenylation or thioacylation defective step into the cytoplasm. hence, lipid modifications of the g(gamma) subunit are dispensable for g protein activation by receptor, but they are required to maintain the plasma membrane association of g(betagamma) after receptor stimulated release from g(alpha). the g protein alpha subunit (gpap) is tandemly modified at its n terminus with amide and thioester linked fatty acids. here we show that gpap was thioacylated in vivo with a mixture of radioactive myristate and palmitate. mutation of the thioacylation site in gpap resulted in yeast cells that displayed partial activation of the pathway in the absence of pheromone. thus, dual lipidation motifs on gpap and step are required for a fully functional pheromone response pathway.
