role of the carbohydrate part of yeast acid phosphatase.. . acid phosphatase, purified from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, was completely deglycosylated by endo beta n acetylglucosaminidase h or by hf treatment. three protein bands were obtained on sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) electrophoresis, with molecular weights of ,, , and ,. the released carbohydrate chains varied in size from to mannose units. to study the role of carbohydrate chains in the structure and function of acid phosphatase, a comparison of the properties of the partially deglycosylated enzyme with the native one was performed. the % deglycosylated enzyme retained the original activity, and cd and fluorescence spectra showed that the native conformation of the enzyme was preserved. the % deglycosylated enzyme showed a pronounced loss of enzyme activity, accompanied by the disruption of the three dimensional structure. the partially deglycosylated enzyme was less soluble and more susceptible to denaturing effects of heat, ph, urea, and guanidine hydrochloride. under conditions of electrophoresis, the partially deglycosylated enzyme dissociated, indicating a possible role of carbohydrate chains in maintaining the dimeric structure of the enzyme. susceptibility of acid phosphatase toward proteolysis was drastically increased by deglycosylation.
