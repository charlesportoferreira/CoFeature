the yeast g protein alpha subunit gpa transmits a signal through an rna binding effector protein scp.. . in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the g protein betagamma subunits (ste/ste) have long been known to transmit the signal required for mating. here we demonstrate that gtpase deficient mutants of galpha (gpa) directly activate the mating response pathway. we also show that signaling by activated gpa requires direct coupling to an rna binding protein scp. these findings suggest an additional role for gpa and reveal scp as a component of the mating response pathway in yeast.
