subcellular localization of yeast cdc varies with the cell cycle.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc protein accumulates in the nucleus of nondividing interphase cells. soon after the cell has become committed to division, there is a rapid disappearance of cdc protein from the nucleus. this shift is not a consequence of variation in total cdc protein levels and is associated with dna replication at the g s boundary. we propose that the cdc protein, which is required for dna replication, becomes mobilized quickly from the cytoplasm into the nucleus as mitosis is completed and persists there until the next round of division is initiated. this partitioning of proteins in a cell cycle dependent manner illustrates a general means of regulating events that must occur only once in each cycle, such as dna initiation.
