associations among ph and sh domain containing proteins and rho type gtpases in yeast.. . the src homology region (sh) domain bearing protein bemp and the rho type gtpase cdcp are important for bud emergence in saccharomyces cervisiae. here, we present evidence that through its second sh domain, bemp binds to the structurally and functionally similar proteins boip and boip, each of which contain an sh and pleckstrin homology (ph) domain. deletion of boi and bo together leads to impaired morphogenesis and poor ability. a ph domain bearing segment of boip that lacks the bemp binding site is necessary and sufficient for function. this segment of boip displays a two hybrid interaction with cdcp, suggesting that boip either binds directly to or is part of a larger complex that contains cdcp. consistent with these possibilities, overexpression of boip inhibits bud emergence, but this inhibition is counteracted by cooverexpression of cdcp. increased expression of the rho type gtpase rhop, which is implicated in bud growth defects of boil boi mutants, suggesting that boip and boip may also play roles in the activation or function of rhop. these findings provide an example of a tight coupling in function between ph domain bearing proteins and both rho type gtpases and sh domain containing proteins, and they raise the possibility that boip and boi play a role in linking the actions of cdcp and rhop.
