identification of a calcineurin independent pathway required for sodium ion stress response in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the calcium dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin plays an essential role in ion homeostasis in yeast. in this study, we identify a parallel ion stress response pathway that is independent of the calcineurin signaling pathway. cells with null alleles in both std and its homologue, mth, manifest numerous phenotypes observed in calcineurin mutants, including sodium, lithium, manganese, and hydroxyl ion sensitivity, as well as alpha factor toxicity. furthermore, increased gene dosage of std suppresses the ion stress phenotypes in calcineurin mutants and confers halotolerance in wild type cells. however, stdp functions in a calcineurin independent ion stress response pathway, since a std mth mutant is fk sensitive under conditions of ion stress. mutations in other genes known to regulate gene expression in response to changes in glucose concentration, including snf, rgt, and snf, also affect cell growth under ion stress conditions. gene expression studies indicate that the regulation of hal and pmr expression is affected by std gene dosage. taken together, our data demonstrate that response to ion stress requires the participation of both calcineurin dependent and independent pathways.
