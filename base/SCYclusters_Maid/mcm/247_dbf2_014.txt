dbf is implicated in a cbt dependent pathway following a shift from glucose to galactose or non fermentable carbon sources in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dbf, a cell cycle regulated protein kinase, has been shown recently to be part of the ccr transcriptional regulatory complex in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. we report here that temperature sensitive (ts) dhf mutant cells can be rescued by overexpression of cdc, which encodes a dual specificity protein phosphatase, when grown on glucose containing medium, as reported previously, but not on galactose. screening of two s. cerevisiae cdna libraries led to the identification of cbt as a gene which, if overexpressed simultaneously with cdc, results in the rescue of the dbj mutation at restrictive temperature on galactose based medium, as well as on media containing non fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol, lactate and acetate. cbt has been shown previously to be essential for formation of cytochrome b in the mitochondria. on the other hand, the ts defects of ccrdelta and cafdelta mutants on glycerol medium at degrees c (ccr and caf/pop are two other members of the ccr complex) could not be complemented by simultaneous overexpression of cbt and cdc. ccr and caf have been shown to play an essential role in activating the expression of genes for non fermentative growth. our results strongly suggest that, within the ccr complex, dbf is directly involved in some mitochondrial function that depends on cytochrome b or on one of its main regulators, cbt. therefore, dbf may be required not only during mitosis but also during growth on non fermentable carbon sources.
