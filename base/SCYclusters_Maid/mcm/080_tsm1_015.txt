cloning and characterization of an essential saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, taf, which encodes ytafii, an rna polymerase ii specific tata binding protein associated factor.. . in this report we describe the cloning and initial characterization of taf, a gene that encodes a yeast tata binding protein associated factor (ytaf) of mr = approximately ,. this gene has many similarities to other ytafs described thus far in that it is present at a single copy per haploid genome, it is essential for viability, and the deduced protein sequence of ytaf exhibits similarity to previously described human and drosophila tafiis. immunological studies confirm that ytaf protein is a subunit of a large multiprotein tata binding protein taf complex that contains a subset of the total number of the ytafs present in yeast cell extracts. transcription reactions performed using yeast whole cell extracts reveal that of the three nuclear rna polymerases only rna polymerase ii function is abrogated when ytaf and associated proteins are immunodepleted from solution, indicating that the functionality of the multiprotein complex containing ytaf is rna polymerase ii specific. by these criteria ytaf appears to encode a bona fide rna polymerase ii specific taf, and thus the protein that it encodes has been termed ytafii.
