direct identification of a g protein ubiquitination site by mass spectrometry.. . covalent attachment of ubiquitin is well known to target proteins for degradation. here, mass spectrometry was used to identify the site of ubiquitination in gpa, the g protein alpha subunit in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the modified residue is located at lys within the alpha helical domain of galpha, a region of unknown function. substitution of lys with arg (gpa(kr)) results in a substantial decrease in ubiquitination. in addition, yeast expressing the gpa(kr) mutant are moderately resistant to pheromone in growth inhibition assays a phenotype consistent with enhanced galpha signaling activity. these findings indicate that the alpha helical domain may serve to regulate the turnover of gpa.
