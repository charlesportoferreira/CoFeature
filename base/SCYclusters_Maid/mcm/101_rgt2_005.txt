the role of hexose transport and phosphorylation in camp signalling in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . glucose induced camp signalling in saccharomyces cerevisiae requires extracellular glucose detection via the gpr gpa g protein coupled receptor system and intracellular glucose sensing that depends on glucose uptake and phosphorylation. the glucose uptake requirement can be fulfilled by any glucose carrier including the gal permease or by intracellular hydrolysis of maltose. hence, the glucose carriers do not seem to play a regulatory role in camp signalling. also the glucose carrier homologues, snf and rgt, are not required for glucose induced camp synthesis. although no further metabolism beyond glucose phosphorylation is required, neither glup nor atp appears to act as metabolic trigger for camp signalling. this indicates that a regulatory function may be associated with the hexose kinases. consistently, intracellular acidification, another known trigger of camp synthesis, can bypass the glucose uptake requirement but not the absence of a functional hexose kinase. this may indicate that intracellular acidification can boost a downstream effect that amplifies the residual signal transmitted via the hexose kinases when glucose uptake is too low.
