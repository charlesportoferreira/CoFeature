functional domains of phop, an inhibitor of phop protein kinase, in the transduction pathway of pi signals in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the pho gene is thought to encode an inhibitor of the negative regulators (phop and phop) in the phosphatase (pho) regulon. transcription of pho is regulated by pi signals through the same pho regulatory system. elimination of the pho promoter or its substitution by the gal promoter revealed that stimulation of the pho regulatory system requires both increased transcription of pho and a pi starvation signal. the predicted phop protein contains , amino acids (aa) and has six repeats of an ankyrin like sequence in its central region. the minimum amino acid sequence required for phop function was narrowed down to a aa segment (aa to ), which contains the fifth and sixth repeats of the ankyrin like motif. the third to sixth repeats of the ankyrin like motif of phop have significant similarities to that of pink, which inhibits activity of the human cyclin d cdk kinase complex. deletion analyses revealed that the n and c terminal regions of phop behave as negative and positive regulatory domains, respectively, for the minimal aa region. the negative regulatory activity of the n terminal domain was antagonized by a c terminal segment of phop supplied in trans. all four known classes of phoc mutations that show repressible acid phosphatase activity in high pi medium affect the n terminal half of phop. an in vitro assay showed that a glutathione s transferase phop fusion protein inhibits the phop protein kinase. association of phop with phop or with the phop phop complex was demonstrated by the two hybrid system.
