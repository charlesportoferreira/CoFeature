phosphorylation of the pheromone responsive gbeta protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae does not affect its mating specific signaling function.. . the pheromone responsive gbeta subunit of saccharomyces cerevisiae (encoded by ste) is rapidly phosphorylated at multiple sites when yeast cells are exposed to mating pheromone. it has been shown that a mutant form of ste lacking residues , stedelta , cannot be phosphorylated, and that its expression leads to defects in recovery from pheromone stimulation. based on these observations, it was proposed that phosphorylation of ste is associated with an adaptive response to mating pheromone. in this study we used site directed mutagenesis to create two phosphorylation null (pho ) alleles of ste. ste ta/sa and ste ta/sa. when expressed in yeast, these mutant forms of ste remained unphosphorylated upon pheromone stimulation. the elimination of ste phosphorylation has no discernible effect on either signaling or adaptation. in addition, disruption of the fus gene, which encodes a pheromone specific map kinase, leads to partial loss of pheromone induced ste phosphorylation. two hybrid analysis suggests that the stedelta deletion mutant is impaired in its interaction with gpa, the pheromone responsive galpha of yeast, whereas the ste ta/sa mutant has normal affinity for gpa. taken together, these results indicate that pheromone induced phosphorylation of ste is not an adaptive mechanism, and that the adaptive defect exhibited by the deletion mutant is likely to be due to disruption of the interaction between ste and gpa.
