identification and characterization of a novel yeast gene. the ygp gene product is a highly glycosylated secreted protein that is synthesized in response to nutrient limitation.. . nutrient starvation in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to a number of physiological changes that accompany entry into stationary phase. the expression of genes whose products play a role in stress adaptation is regulated in a manner that allows the cell to sense and respond to changing environmental conditions. we have identified a novel yeast gene, ygp, that displays homology to the sporulation specific sps gene. the expression of ygp is regulated by nutrient availability. the gene is expressed at a basal level during &quot;respiro fermentative&quot; (logarithmic) growth. when the glucose concentration in the medium falls below %, the ygp gene is derepressed and the gene product, gp, is synthesized at levels up to fold above the basal level. the glucose sensing mechanism is independent of the snf pathway and does not operate when cells are directly shifted to a low glucose concentration. the expression of ygp also responds to the depletion of nitrogen and phosphate, indicating a general response to nutrient deprivation. these results suggest that the ygp gene product may be involved in cellular adaptations prior to stationary phase and may be a useful marker protein for monitoring early events associated with the stress response.
