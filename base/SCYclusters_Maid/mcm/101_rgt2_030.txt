dominant and recessive suppressors that restore glucose transport in a yeast snf mutant.. . the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a high affinity glucose transporter that is homologous to mammalian glucose transporters. to identify genes that are functionally related to snf, we selected for suppressors that remedy the growth defect of snf mutants on low concentrations of glucose or fructose. we recovered recessive mutations that fall into a single complementation group, designated rgt (restores glucose transport). the rgt mutations suppress a snf null mutation and are not linked to snf. a naturally occurring rgt allele was identified in a laboratory strain. we also selected five dominant suppressors. at least two are tightly linked to one another and are designated rgt. the rgt locus was mapped cm from snf on chromosome iv. kinetic analysis of glucose uptake showed that the rgt and rgt suppressors restore glucose repressible high affinity glucose transport in a snf mutant. these mutations identify genes that may regulate or encode additional glucose transport proteins.
