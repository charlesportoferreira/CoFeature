an eukaryotic ruvb like protein (ruvbl) essential for growth.. . a human protein (ruvbl), consisting of amino acids ( kda) and highly homologous to ruvb, was identified by using the kda subunit of replication protein a (hsrpa) as bait in a yeast two hybrid system. ruvb is a bacterial protein involved in genetic recombination that bears structural similarity to subunits of the rf c clamp loader family of proteins. fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that the ruvbl gene is located at q, a region with frequent rearrangements in different types of leukemia and solid tumors. ruvbl co immunoprecipitated with at least three other unidentified cellular proteins and was detected in the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme complex purified over multiple chromatographic steps. in addition, two yeast homologs, scruvbl and scruvbl with and % identity to ruvbl, respectively, were revealed by screening the complete saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence. yeast with a null mutation in scruvbl was nonviable. thus ruvbl is an eukaryotic member of the ruvb/clamp loader family of structurally related proteins from bacteria and eukaryotes that is essential for viability of yeast.
