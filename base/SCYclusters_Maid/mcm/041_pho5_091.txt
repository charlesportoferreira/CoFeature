expression of rat alpha reductase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dihydrotestosterone (dht) is the principle androgen in certain tissues such as the prostate. dht is formed from testosterone by the nadph dependent enzyme alpha reductase (ar). in this paper we report the expression of catalytically active steroid ar from the rat in saccharomyces cerevisiae. a full length cdna coding for ar was isolated from a rat liver cdna library and fixed in frame to the signal sequence of yeast acid phosphatase. a constitutive short promoter fragment of the acid phosphatase gene (pho) and the pho transcriptional terminator were added and the expression cassette ligated into the yeast mu vector pdp. s. cerevisiae transformed with the ar expression plasmid pdp/phoar exhibited about fold more activity per gram wet weight than rat prostate.
