evidence for a role of mcm (mini chromosome maintenance) in transcriptional repression of sub telomeric and ty proximal genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the mcm (mini chromosome maintenance) genes have a well established role in the initiation of dna replication and in the elongation of replication forks in saccharomyces cerevisiae. in this study we demonstrate elevated expression of sub telomeric and ty retrotransposon proximal genes in two mcm strains. this pattern of up regulated genes resembles the genome wide association of mcm proteins to chromatin that was reported earlier. we link the altered gene expression in mcm strains to a reversal of telomere position effect (tpe) and to remodeling of sub telomeric and ty chromatin. we also show a suppression of the ts phenotype of a mcm strain by the high copy expression of the tra component of the chromatin remodeling saga/ada (spt ada gcn acetylase/adaptor). we propose that mcm proteins mediate the establishment of silent chromatin domains around telomeres and ty retrotransposons.
