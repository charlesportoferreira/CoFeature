gbetagamma recruits rho to the site of polarized growth during mating in budding yeast.. . in mating mixtures of saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells polarize their growth toward their conjugation partners along a pheromone gradient. this chemotropic phenomenon is mediated by structural proteins such as far and bem and by signaling proteins such as cdc, cdc, and gbetagamma. the gbetagamma subunit is thought to provide a positional cue that recruits the polarity establishment proteins, and thereby induces polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. we identified rho in a screen for allele specific high copy suppressors of gbetagamma overexpression, suggesting that rho binds gbetagamma in vivo. inactivation of rho gtpase activity augmented the rescue phenotype, suggesting that it is the activated form of rho that binds gbetagamma. we also found, in a pull down assay, that rho associates with gst ste and that rho is localized to the neck and tip of mating projections. moreover, a mutation in ste that disrupts gbetagamma rho interaction reduces the projection tip localization of rho and compromises the integrity of pheromone treated cells deficient in rho activity. in addition to its roles as a positive regulator of , beta glucan synthase and of the cell integrity map kinase cascade, it was recently shown that rho is necessary for the formation of mating projections. together, these results suggest that gbetagamma recruits rho to the site of polarized growth during mating.
