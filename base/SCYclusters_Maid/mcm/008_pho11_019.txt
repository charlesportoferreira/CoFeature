role of glycosylation in secretion of yeast acid phosphatase.. . the minimal glycosylation requirement for acid phosphatase secretion and activity was investigated using tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation, and a yeast mutant defective in the synthesis of oligosaccharide outer chains. the results obtained show that outer chain addition is not essential for secretion of active enzyme and that only core chains, out of normally attached to a protein subunit, are sufficient for enzyme transport to the periplasmic space. enzyme forms with less than chains were retained in membranes of endoplasmic reticulum. secreted underglycosylated enzyme forms are partially or completely inactive.
