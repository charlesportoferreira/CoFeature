the structure and function of mcm from archaeal m. thermoautotrophicum.. . eukaryotic chromosomal dna is licensed for replication precisely once in each cell cycle. the mini chromosome maintenance (mcm) complex plays a role in this replication licensing. we have determined the structure of a fragment of mcm from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (mtmcm), a model system for eukaryotic mcm. the structure reveals a novel dodecameric architecture with a remarkably long central channel. the channel surface has an unusually high positive charge and binds dna. we also show that the structure of the n terminal fragment is conserved for all mcms proteins despite highly divergent sequences, suggesting a common architecture for a similar task. gripping/remodeling dna and regulating mcm activity. an mtmcm mutant protein equivalent to a yeast mcm (cdc) protein with the bob mutation at its n terminus has only subtle structural changes, suggesting a cdc bypass mechanism by bob in yeast. yeast bypass experiments using mcm mutant proteins support the hypothesis for the bypass mechanism.
