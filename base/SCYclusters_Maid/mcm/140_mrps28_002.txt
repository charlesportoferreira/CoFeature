derivatives of the yeast mitochondrial ribosomal protein mrps replace ribosomal protein s as functional components of the escherichia coli ribosome.. . the mitochondrial ribosomal protein mrps is considerably larger than its eubacterial homolog, escherichia coli ribosomal protein s (eco s). relative to a region of homology that spans the entire length of the bacterial protein, mature mrps is extended by and amino acids at its amino and carboxyl termini, respectively. both the amino terminal and s like domains of mrps are essential for function in yeast mitochondria. here, we show that these same two domains function in e. coli. the s like domain of mrps alone complements a cold sensitive mutation in e. coli strain kr that gives rise to reduced levels of eco s. however, complementation by the s like domain of mrps is inefficient when compared with eco s. surprisingly, the amino terminal domain of mrps, which is apparently a unique component of the mitochondrial ribosome and is unable by itself to complement the cold sensitive phenotype, enhances the ability of the s like domain to support growth of kr cells at nonpermissive temperatures. together, these data suggest that the amino terminal domain contributes to the fundamental properties of mrps involved in the assembly and function of both mitochondrial and e. coli ribosomes.
