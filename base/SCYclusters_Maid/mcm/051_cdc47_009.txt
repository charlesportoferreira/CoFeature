hcdc, a human member of the mcm family. dissociation of the nucleus bound form during s phase.. . hcdc is a putative human homologue of yeast cdc and a member of the mcm protein family, which has been implicated in the regulatory machinery causing dna to replicate only once in the s phase. in the present study, we performed an initial characterization of hcdc. we found that hcdc protein was present in the nucleus of cultured human cells in two different forms; one extractable by a non ionic detergent and the other resistant to such extraction and tightly associated with the nucleus. the levels of the nucleus bound form gradually diminished during s phase progression, although the total amount of nuclear hcdc protein remained relatively constant, suggesting that the nucleus bound form becomes dissociated from the nuclear structure during dna replication. this behavior of hcdc protein is very similar to that of other mammalian mcm proteins reported recently. we also found that expression of hcdc mrna was repressed in quiescent cells but was induced at the late g to s phase by growth factor stimulation. together, these findings indicate that hcdc protein together with other mcm proteins participates in the regulation of mammalian dna replication.
