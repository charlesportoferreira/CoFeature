yeast histone h and h n termini function through different gal regulatory elements to repress and activate transcription.. . previous work has shown that n terminal deletions of yeast histone h cause a to fold increase in the induction of gal and a number of other genes involved in galactose metabolism. in contrast, deletions at the h n terminus cause a to fold decrease in the induction of these same gal genes. however, h and h n terminal deletions each decrease pho induction only to fold. to define the gal gene regulatory elements through which the histone n termini activate or repress transcription, fusions were made between gal and pho promoter elements attached to a beta galactosidase reporter gene. we show here that gal hyperactivation caused by the h n terminal deletion delta is linked to the upstream activation sequence. conversely, the relative decrease in gal induction caused by the hn terminal deletion delta is linked to the downstream promoter which contains the tata element. these data indicate that the h n terminus is required for the repression of the gal upstream element, whereas the hn terminus is required for the activation of the gal downstream promoter element.
