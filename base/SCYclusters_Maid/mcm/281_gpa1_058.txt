the yeast g protein homolog is involved in the mating pheromone signal transduction system.. . i have isolated a new type of sterile mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae, carrying a single mutant allele, designated dac, which was mapped near the centromere on chromosome viii. the dac mutation caused specific defects in the pheromone responsiveness of both a and alpha cells and did not seem to be associated with any pleiotropic phenotypes. thus, in contrast to the ste, ste, ste, ste, and ste mutations, the dac mutation had no significant effect on such constitutive functions of haploid cells as pheromone production and alpha factor destruction. the characteristics of this phenotype suggest that the dac gene encodes a component of the pheromone response pathway common to both a and alpha cells. introduction of the gpa gene encoding an s. cerevisiae homolog of the alpha subunit of mammalian guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins (g proteins) into sterile dac mutants resulted in restoration of pheromone responsiveness and mating competence to both a and alpha cells. these results suggest that the dac mutation is an allele of the gpa gene and thus provide genetic evidence that the yeast g protein homolog is directly involved in the mating pheromone signal transduction pathway.
