the product of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle gene dbf has homology with protein kinases and is periodically expressed in the cell cycle.. . several saccharomyces cerevisiae dbf mutants defective in dna synthesis have been described previously. in this paper, one of them, dbf, is characterized in detail. the dbf gene has been cloned and mapped, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. this process has identified an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of molecular weight , ( amino acids). the deduced amino acid sequence contains all conserved domains found in various protein kinases. dbf was periodically expressed in the cell cycle at a time that clearly differed from the time of expression of either the histone ha or dna polymerase i gene. its first function was completed very near to initiation of dna synthesis. however, dna synthesis in the mutant was only delayed at degrees c, and the cells blocked in nuclear division. consistent with this finding, the execution point occurred about h after dna synthesis, and the nuclear morphology of the mutant at the restrictive temperature was that of cells blocked in late nuclear division. dbf is therefore likely to encode a protein kinase that may function in initiation of dna synthesis and also in late nuclear division.
