function of the pho regulatory genes for repressible acid phosphatase synthesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . expression of the repressible acid phosphatase (rapase) gene, pho, of saccharomyces cerevisiae is repressed by a certain level of inorganic phosphate (pi) in the medium and is derepressed when the pi concentration is lowered. the pi signals are conveyed to pho by a regulatory system consisting of proteins coded for by the pho, pho, pho and pho genes. we have found that the transcription of pho is regulated by pi through the pho regulatory system. increasing the dosage of pho and pho by ligating each gene to yep gives rise to, respectively, considerable and weak synthesis of rapase by cultivation of the transformants in high pi medium; but in low pi medium, increased dosage of pho stimulates the rapase synthesis significantly, whereas pho has no effect. increased dosage of pho stimulates rapase synthesis considerably in low pi but not in high pi. a coordinate increase of pho cancels the dosage effect of pho, but not that of pho. coordinate increases of pho and pho give rise to the same phenotype as an increased dosage of pho alone. the level of the pho protein was found to be the limiting factor of the rapase synthesis and the copy number of the pho gene not to be. these facts accord with the idea that the pho protein transmits the pi signals to the pho gene via the pho protein, whereas the pho protein does not have a direct function in the signal transmission.
