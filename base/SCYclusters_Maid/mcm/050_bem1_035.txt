nucleotide sequence analysis of an . kb fragment of yeast chromosome ii including bem, a new gene of the wd repeat family and a new member of the kre/mnt family.. . this paper reports the dna sequence and analysis of an . kb segment localized on the right arm of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome ii. this fragment contains one incomplete and five long and non overlapping open reading frames (orfs) designated from centromere to telomere proximal side as. ybr, , , , and . ybr corresponds to the ' end to pg encoding phosphoglucoisomerase. ybr encodes a polypeptide of amino acids whose c terminus contains five repeats (wd repeat) similar to those found in the beta subunits of g proteins and different yeast proteins such as tup, prp and cdc. the higher similarity score is obtained with dtafii, a component of the rna polymerase ii transcriptional complex tfiid. ybr encodes a polypeptide of amino acids which belongs to the family of alpha mannosyltransferases. kre/mnt, ktr, ktr, yur and the product of previously sequenced orf ybr. ybr corresponds to bem. the two orfs, ybr and ybr, which do not exhibit significant similarity with any known coding sequences, define new genes.
