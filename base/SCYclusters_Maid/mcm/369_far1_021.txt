far and the g phase specificity of cell cycle arrest by mating factor in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . significant accumulation of farp is restricted to the g phase of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. here we demonstrate yeast cell cycle regulation of farp proteolysis. deletions within the n terminal amino acids of farp increase stability and reduce cell cycle regulation of farp abundance. whereas wild type farp specifically and exclusively promotes g phase arrest in response to mating factor, stabilized farp promoted arrest both during and after g. the loss of the g specificity of farp action requires elimination of far transcriptional regulation (by means of the gal promoter) as well as n terminal truncation. thus, the cell cycle specificity of mating factor arrest may be largely due to cell cycle regulation of far transcription and protein stability.
