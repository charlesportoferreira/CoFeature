effects of expression of mammalian g alpha and hybrid mammalian yeast g alpha proteins on the yeast pheromone response signal transduction pathway.. . scg, the product of the saccharomyces cerevisiae scg (also called gpa) gene, is homologous to the alpha subunits of g proteins involved in signal transduction in mammalian cells. scg negatively controls the pheromone response pathway in haploid cells. either pheromonal activation or an scg null mutation relieves the negative control and leads to an arrest of cell growth in the g phase of the cell cycle. expression of rat g alpha s was previously shown to complement the growth defect of scg null mutants while not allowing mating. we have extended this analysis to examine the effects of the short form of g alpha s (which lacks amino acids present in the long form), g alpha i, g alpha o, and scg mammalian g alpha hybrids. in addition, we have found that constructs able to complement scg are also able to inhibit the response to pheromone and mating when expressed in a wild type scg strain. overexpression of scg has a similar inhibitory effect. these results are consistent with a model proposed for the action of scg as the alpha component of a heterotrimeric g protein in which the beta gamma component (ste/ste) activates the pheromone response after dissociation from scg. they suggest that the g alpha constructs able to complement scg can interact with beta gamma to prevent activation of the pathway but are unable to interact with pheromone receptors to activate the pathway.
