biochemical and genetic analysis of dominant negative mutations affecting a yeast g protein gamma subunit.. . heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (g proteins) consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits mediate signalling between cell surface receptors and intracellular effectors in eukaryotic cells. to define signalling functions of g gamma subunits (ste gene product) involved in pheromone response and mating in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated and characterized dominant negative ste alleles. we obtained dominant negative mutations that disrupt c terminal sequences required for prenylation of g gamma precursors (caax box) and that affect residues in the n terminal half of step. overexpression of mutant g gamma subunits in wild type cells blocked signal transduction; this effect was suppressed upon overexpression of g beta subunits. mutant g gamma subunits may therefore sequester g beta subunits into nonproductive g beta gamma dimers. because mutant g gamma subunits blocked the constitutive signal resulting from disruption of the g alpha subunit gene (gpa), they are defective in functions required for downstream signalling. step bearing a cy substitution in the caax box displayed reduced electrophoretic mobility, consistent with a prenylation defect. g gamma subunits carrying n terminal substitutions had normal electrophoretic mobilities, suggesting that these proteins were prenylated. g gamma subunits bearing substitutions in their n terminal region or c terminal caax box (cy) supported receptor g protein coupling in vitro, whereas c terminal truncations caused partial defects in receptor coupling.
