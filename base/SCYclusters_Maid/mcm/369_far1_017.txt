novel aspects of pheromone induced cell cycle arrest in yeast.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to pheromones by arresting cell cycle progression at the g/s boundary. this arrest has been shown to require the activation by phosphorylation of far, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor. arrest resembling pheromone induced arrest can be triggered by high levels of ste, the pheromone responsive transcriptional activator. in the present study, cell cycle arrest induced by high levels of ste is characterized. this arrest occurs predominately at the g/s boundary and is independent of far and upstream components of the pheromone response pathway. since ste is a transcriptional activator, it is proposed that cell cycle arrest in response to high levels of ste is due to transcription of a ste dependent arrest factor regulated primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, at the level of transcription. the data presented here suggest that a novel component has a role in arrest in response to pheromone.
