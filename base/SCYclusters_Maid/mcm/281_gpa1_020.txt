switch domain mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae g protein alpha subunit gpap identify a receptor subtype biased mating defect.. . the response to pheromone in saccharomyces cerevisiae involves a heterotrimeric g protein composed of gpap (alpha subunit), step (beta) and step (gamma). the switch ii region of g alpha subunits is involved in several protein protein interactions and an intrinsic gtpase activity. to investigate the role of this region of gpap, we have analyzed the effect of switch ii mutations. the q analog in g alpha subunits and ras is implicated in gtp hydrolysis. mutation of the q residue of gpap resulted in constitutive activation of the pheromone response pathway and eliminated the ability to interact with step, consistent with a defect in gtpase activity. mutation of residue a of ras and the analogous g alphas residue has had quite different effects. the analogous gpap gt mutation resulted in phenotypes consistent with a less severe gtpase defect, but also led to an unexpected mating phenotype. mating was decreased in both mating types, but the defect was fold more severe in alpha cells than in a cells. in addition the gt mutation resulted in an unusual pheromone response phenotype. we discuss the possibility that these phenotypes may reflect a differential role for the switch ii region in activation by the a and alpha factor receptors.
