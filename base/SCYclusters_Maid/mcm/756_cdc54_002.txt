drosophila mcm protein complexes.. . mcm genes encode a family of evolutionarily conserved proteins required for dna replication. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, where they were first identified, mcm genes interact genetically with each other. allele specificity in these interactions suggests that mcm proteins physically associate with one another and that this association is essential for function. we describe here an analysis of physical interactions among three drosophila mcm proteins. using specific antibodies we detect drosophila mcms almost exclusively in kda protein complexes. co immunoprecipitation data demonstrate the existence of at least two distinct types of kda complexes, one that contains dmcdc and one that appears to contain both dmmcm and dpa (a cdc homologue). these complexes are stable throughout embryonic division cycles, are resistant to treatments with salt and detergent, and are present during development in tissues undergoing mitotic dna replication as well as endoreplication. when extracts are prepared under low salt conditions all three mcm proteins co immunoprecipitate. consequently, we suggest that the kda complexes interact in a higher order complex.
