rgtp of saccharomyces cerevisiae, a key regulator of glucose induced genes, is both an activator and a repressor of transcription.. . the rgt gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a central role in the glucose induced expression of hexose transporter (hxt) genes. genetic evidence suggests that it encodes a repressor of the hxt genes whose function is inhibited by glucose. here, we report the isolation of rgt and demonstrate that it encodes a bifunctional transcription factor. rgtp displays three different transcriptional modes in response to glucose. (i) in the absence of glucose, it functions as a transcriptional repressor; (ii) high concentrations of glucose cause it to function as a transcriptional activator; and (iii) in cells growing on low levels of glucose, rgtp has a neutral role, neither repressing nor activating transcription. glucose alters rgtp function through a pathway that includes two glucose sensors, snfp and rgtp, and grrp. the glucose transporter snfp, which appears to be a low glucose sensor, is required for inhibition of rgtp repressor function by low levels of glucose. rgtp, a glucose transporter that functions as a high glucose sensor, is required for conversion of rgtp into an activator by high levels of glucose. grrp, a component of the glucose signaling pathway, is required both for inactivation of rgtp repressor function by low levels of glucose and for conversion of rgtp into an activator at high levels of glucose. thus, signals generated by two different glucose sensors act through grrp to determine rgtp function.
