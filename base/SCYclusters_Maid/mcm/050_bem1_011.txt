direct binding and in vivo regulation of the fission yeast p activated kinase shk by the sh domain protein scd.. . the ste/p activated kinase homolog shk is essential for viability and required for normal morphology, mating, and cell cycle control in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. shk is regulated by the p g protein cdc, which has been shown to form a complex with the sh domain protein scd (also called ral). in this study, we investigated whether scd plays a role in regulating shk function. we found that recombinant scd and shk interact directly in vitro and that they interact in vivo, as determined by the two hybrid assay and genetic analyses in fission yeast. the second of two n terminal sh domains of scd is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with shk. while full length scd interacted with only the r n terminal regulatory subdomain of shk, a c terminal deletion mutant of scd interacted with both the r and r subdomains of shk, suggesting that the non sh c terminal domain of scd may be involved in defining specificity in sh binding domain recognition. overexpression of scd stimulated the autophosphorylation activity of wild type shk in fission yeast but, consistent with results of genetic analyses, did not stimulate the activity of a shk protein lacking the r subdomain. results of additional two hybrid experiments suggest that scd may stimulate shk catalytic function, at least in part, by positively modulating protein protein interaction between cdc and shk. we propose that scd functions as an organizing center, or scaffold, for the cdc complex in fission yeast and that it acts in concert with cdc to positively regulate shk function.
