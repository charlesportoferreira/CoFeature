far and five interacting proteins prevent premature recovery from pheromone arrest in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in budding yeast, diffusible mating pheromones initiate a signaling pathway that culminates in several responses, including cell cycle arrest. only a handful of genes required for the interface between pheromone response and the cell cycle have been identified, among them far and far; of these, only far has been extensively characterized. in an effort to learn about the mechanism by which far acts, we used the two hybrid method to identify interacting proteins. we identified five previously uncharacterized open reading frames, dubbed far, far, far, far, and far, that cause a far like pheromone arrest defect when disrupted. using two hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, we found that all six far proteins interact with each other. moreover, velocity sedimentation experiments suggest that far and far to far form a complex. the phenotype of a sextuple farfar far mutant is no more severe than any single mutant. thus, far and far to far all participate in the same pathway leading to g arrest. these mutants initially arrest in response to pheromone but resume budding after h. under these conditions, wild type cells fail to resume budding even after several days whereas far mutant cells resume budding within h. we conclude that the far dependent arrest pathway is functionally distinct from that which employs far.
