differential regulation of two ca(+) influx systems by pheromone signaling in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae generates calcium signals during the response to mating pheromones that promote survival of unmated cells. a ca(+) channel composed of cchp and midp was previously shown to be necessary for the production of these calcium signals. however, we find that the cchp midp high affinity ca(+) influx system (hacs) contributes very little to signaling or survival after treatment with alpha factor in rich media. hacs activity was much greater after calcineurin inactivation or inhibition, suggesting the cchp midp ca(+) channel is subject to direct or indirect regulation by calcineurin. instead a distinct low affinity ca(+) influx system (lacs) was stimulated by pheromone signaling in rich medium. lacs activity was insensitive to calcineurin activity, independent of cchp and midp, and sufficient to elevate cytosolic free ca(+) concentrations ([ca(+)]c) in spite of its fold lower affinity for ca(+). overexpression of step or constitutive activation of this transcription factor in dig dig double mutants had no effect on lacs activity but stimulated hacs activity when calcineurin was also inactivated. step activation had no effect on cchp or midp abundance, suggesting the involvement of another target of step in hacs stimulation. lacs activation required treatment with mating pheromone even in dig dig double mutants and also required far, spa, and bni, which are necessary for proper cell cycle arrest and polarized morphogenesis. these results show that distinct branches of the pheromone signaling pathway independently regulate hacs and lacs activities, either of which can promote survival during long term responses.
