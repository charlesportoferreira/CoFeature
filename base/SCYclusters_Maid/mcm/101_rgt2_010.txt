sut, a putative sucrose sensor in sieve elements.. . in leaves, sucrose uptake kinetics involve high and low affinity components. a family of low and high affinity sucrose transporters (sut) was identified. sut serves as a high affinity transporter essential for phloem loading and long distance transport in solanaceous species. sut is a low affinity transporter with an expression pattern overlapping that of sut. both sut and sut localize to enucleate sieve elements of tomato. new sucrose transporter like proteins, named sut, from tomato and arabidopsis contain extended cytoplasmic domains, thus structurally resembling the yeast sugar sensors snf and rgt. features common to these sensors are low codon bias, environment of the start codon, low expression, and lack of detectable transport activity. in contrast to lesut, which is induced during the sink to source transition of leaves, sut is more highly expressed in sink than in source leaves and is inducible by sucrose. lesut protein colocalizes with the low and high affinity sucrose transporters in sieve elements of tomato petioles, indicating that multiple sut mrnas or proteins travel from companion cells to enucleate sieve elements. the sut gene maps on chromosome v of potato and is linked to a major quantitative trait locus for tuber starch content and yield. thus, the putative sugar sensor identified colocalizes with two other sucrose transporters, differs from them in kinetic properties, and potentially regulates the relative activity of low and high affinity sucrose transport into sieve elements.
