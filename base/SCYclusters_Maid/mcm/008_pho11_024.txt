physicochemical and kinetic properties of acid phosphatase from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . acid phosphatase from yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified, and its physicochemical and kinetic properties were investigated. the sedimentation coefficient has been determined to be s(,w) = . s. the diffusion constant has been found to be . x ( ) cms , and the calculated partial specific volume was v = . cm/g. from these data, a molecular weight of , was calculated. electrophoresis on gel slabs, with a linear concentration gradient of polyacrylamide ( %), showed size heterogeneity of the native enzyme preparation and indicated an apparent molecular weight in the range of , to ,. in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the molecular weight was in the range of , to ,, indicating dimeric structure of the native enzyme, which was confirmed by cross linking experiments. isoelectric focusing demonstrated charge heterogeneity of enzyme preparation. from cd spectrum it was calculated that the enzyme contains about % of alpha helical structure. excitation at nm gave an emission fluorescence spectrum with a maximum at nm. amino acid analysis revealed a high content of aspartic acid, serine, and threonine. glycine is found as the nh terminal amino acid. initial velocity dependence on substrate concentration, as well as on ph, and thermostability studies indicated the presence of at least two enzyme forms in the preparation.
