a generic time resolved fluorescence assay for serine/threonine kinase activity. application to cdc/dbf.. . the serine/threonine protein kinase family is a large and diverse group of enzymes that are involved in the regulation of multiple cellular pathways. elevated kinase activity has been implicated in many diseases and frequently targeted for the development of pharmacological inhibitors. therefore, non radioactive antibody based kinase assays that allow high throughput screening of compound libraries have been developed. however, they require a generation of antibodies against the phosphorylated form of a specific substrate. we report here a time resolved fluorescence assay platform that utilizes a commercially available generic anti phospho threonine antibody and permits assaying kinases that are able to phosporylate threonin residues on protein substrates. using this approach, we developed an assay for cdc/dbf kinase activity, determined the k(m) for atp, and identified rottlerin as a non atp competitive inhibitor of this enzyme.
