assembly of scaffold mediated complexes containing cdcp, the exchange factor cdcp, and the effector clap required for cell cycle regulated phosphorylation of cdcp.. . in budding yeast cells, the cytoskeletal polarization and depolarization events that shape the bud are triggered at specific times during the cell cycle by the cyclin dependent kinase cdcp. polarity establishment also requires the small gtpase cdcp and its exchange factor, cdcp, but the mechanism whereby cdcp induces cdcp dependent polarization is unknown. here we show that cdcp becomes phosphorylated in a cell cycle dependent manner, triggered by cdcp. however, the role of cdcp is indirect, and the phosphorylation appears to be catalyzed by the p activated kinase family member clap and also depends on cdcp and the scaffold protein bemp. expression of gtp cdcp, the product of cdcp mediated gdp/gtp exchange, stimulated cdcp phosphorylation independent of cell cycle cues, raising the possibility that the phosphorylation is part of a feedback regulatory pathway. bemp binds directly to cdcp, to clap, and to gtp bound cdcp and can mediate complex formation between these proteins in vitro. we suggest that bemp acts to concentrate polarity establishment proteins at a discrete site, facilitating polarization and promoting cdcp phosphorylation at specific times during the cell cycle.
