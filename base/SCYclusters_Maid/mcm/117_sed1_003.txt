sed gene length and sequence polymorphisms in feral strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the sed gene (ydrw), coding for the major cell wall glycoprotein of saccharomyces cerevisiae stationary phase cells, contains two blocks of tandem repeat units located within two distinct regions of the nucleotide sequence. a pcr survey of the sed open reading frames (orfs) of previously uncharacterized grape must isolates of s. cerevisiae yielded pcr profiles arising from different combinations of seven sed length variants in individuals homozygous or heterozygous for the gene. comparison of the nucleotide sequences of a group of representatives of each of the seven length variants with those of sc and the type strain, cbs, unequivocally identified them as sed alleles and provided evidence for the presence of two minisatellite like sequences, variable in length, within the orf of an s. cerevisiae gene. the segregation analyses of the sed length variants and other genetic markers in isolates representative of each pcr profile suggested that molecular mechanisms involved in minisatellite expansion and contraction may be responsible for sed heterozygosities within a population of homothallic must isolates of s. cerevisiae.
