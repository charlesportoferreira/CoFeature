premature structural changes at replication origins in a yeast minichromosome maintenance (mcm) mutant.. . the cdcp protein kinase in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is thought to help trigger dna replication by modifying one or more of the factors that assemble at replication origins (arss). to investigate events catalyzed by cdcp, we compared the structure of replication origins in cells containing conditional mutations in cdcp and cdcp, a thymidylate kinase that is required for dna synthesis. high resolution genomic footprinting indicated that the presumptive lagging strand template in ars became highly sensitive to kmno() modification after the cdc execution point. these results suggested that cdcp triggers dna unwinding. the transition from late g() phase to the cdc execution point and from the cdc to the cdc execution points was accompanied by small but ars dependent changes in dna topology. these results suggested that dna unwinding before the cdc execution point either is highly localized or that the torsional stress associated with initial dna unwinding is minimized by compensatory protein dna structural changes. the ars dna structural attributes evident in cells blocked at the cdc execution point were also evident in alpha factor blocked, g() phase cells containing the cdc bypass mutant mcm/cdc bob. this result strongly suggests that the structural changes during the transition from the cdc to cdc execution points depend on the cdcp protein kinase and involve alteration of the minichromosome maintenance protein complex.
