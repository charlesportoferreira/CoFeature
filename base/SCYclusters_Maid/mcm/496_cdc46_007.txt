coding sequence and chromosome mapping of the human gene (cdc) for replication protein hcdc/mcm.. . we have isolated the complete cdna sequence encoding the human homolog of the yeast replication protein cdc/mcm. the cdna was used as a probe for chromosomal fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), which localized the human cdc gene (cdc) to chromosome region q. &gt;q.. this is the fourth human mcm gene whose chromosome region has been determined, and it is now apparent that human mcm genes are widely distributed in the genome. as deduced from the cdna sequence, human protein hcdc is composed of amino acids and contains a central region that is almost % identical with the yeast protein. immunoprecipitation experiments with hcdc specific antibodies confirm that essentially all nuclear hcdc proteins form a stable dimeric complex with protein pmcm.
