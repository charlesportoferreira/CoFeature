comparative analysis of the ' end regions of two repressible acid phosphatase genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the nucleotide sequence of ' noncoding and n terminal coding regions of two coordinately regulated, repressible acid phosphatase genes from saccharomyces cerevisiae were determined. these unlinked genes encode different, but structurally related polypeptides of molecular weights , and ,. the dna sequences of their ' flanking regions show stretches of extensive homology upstream of, and surrounding, a &quot;tata&quot; sequence and in a region in which heterogeneous ' ends of the p mrna were mapped. the predicted amino acid sequences encoded by the n terminal regions of both genes were confirmed by determination of the amino acid sequence of the native exocellular acid phosphatase and the partial sequence of the presecretory polypeptide synthesized in a cell free protein synthesizing system. the n terminal region of the p polypeptide was shown to be characterized by a hydrophobic amino acid signal polypeptide which is absent in the native exocellular protein and thought to be necessary for acid phosphatase secretion.
