mitochondrial dna loss by yeast reentry mutant cells conditionally unable to proliferate from stationary phase.. . double mutant cells of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring the gcs and sed mutations are conditionally defective (cold sensitive) only for reentry into the mitotic cycle from stationary phase. if already proliferating at the permissive temperature ( degrees c), these reentry mutant cells continue to proliferate when transferred to the restrictive temperature of degrees c, but under these conditions reentry mutant cells lose mitochondrial dna (mtdna). in addition, upon exhaustion of the nutrient supply at degrees c, these reentry mutant cells entered stationary phase at a decreased cell concentration and did not accumulate the reserve carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen. both of these deficiencies were due to the loss of mtdna, as shown by the responses of wild type cells also lacking mtdna. mitochondrial status did not affect other aspects of the reentry mutant phenotype. although mitochondrial activity and the accumulation of carbohydrate reserves are typical features of cells in stationary phase, the reentry mutant phenotype reveals that neither entry into nor exit from stationary phase need involve mitochondrial function.
