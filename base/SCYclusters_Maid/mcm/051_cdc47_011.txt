properties of the human nuclear protein pmcm. expression, nuclear localization and interaction with other mcm proteins.. . recently we identified a cdna fragment encoding a conserved part of a new human minichromosome maintenance (mcm) protein, provisionally termed p.mcm. here, we report that the protein is most highly related to a yeast cell division cycle protein, cdc, encoded by the open reading frame ybr on chromosome of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the human protein migrates on a polyacrylamide gel with an apparent molecular mass of kda and shares areas of significant similarity with the mcm family of replication proteins. it is, therefore, designated as pmcm. microscopic immuno fluorescence studies revealed that protein pmcm is located in the nuclei of interphase cells, but is evenly distributed throughout the cell during mitosis. the amounts of pmcm do not significantly change during the cell cycle, but mrna levels rise with the beginning of the s phase. however, in vitro differentiation of hl cells results in a striking decrease of both pmcm mrna and protein levels, suggesting a role for pmcm in proliferating, but not in differentiated cells. under physiological salt conditions, pmcm is a component of a high molecular mass complex including other mcm proteins. the complex dissociates at high ionic strength giving rise to stable subcomplexes, one of which contains protein pmcm together with mcm proteins hcdc and pomcm.
