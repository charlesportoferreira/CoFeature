regulation of pho nuclear localization by the pho pho cyclin cdk complex.. . pho, a transcription factor required for induction of the pho gene in response to phosphate starvation, is phosphorylated by the pho pho cyclin cdk (cyclin dependent kinase) complex when yeast are grown in phosphate rich medium. pho was shown to be concentrated in the nucleus when yeast were starved for phosphate and was predominantly cytoplasmic when yeast were grown in phosphate rich medium. the sites of phosphorylation on pho were identified, and phosphorylation was shown to be required for full repression of pho transcription when yeast were grown in high phosphate. thus, phosphorylation of pho by pho pho turns off pho transcription by regulating the nuclear localization of pho.
