spo is a multicopy suppressor of mcs that is periodically expressed in fission yeast mitosis.. . hyperactivation of cdc in fission yeast causes cells to undergo a lethal premature mitosis, a phenomenon called mitotic catastrophe. this phenotype is observed in cdc w wee cells at high temperature and is suppressed by a single recessive mutant, mcs . mcs acts independently of the wee kinase and cdc phosphatase, two major regulators of cdc. we have isolated multicopy suppressors of the cell cycle arrest phenotype of mcs wee cdc cells, but did not identify the mcs gene itself. instead several known mitotic regulators were isolated, including the cdc phosphatase, wis cyclophilin, cek kinase, and an hsp homologue, swo. we also isolated clones encoding non functional, truncated forms of the wee kinase and dis type phosphatase. in addition we identified a multicopy suppressor that encodes a structural homologue of the budding yeast spo gene. we find that overexpression of fission yeast spo not only suppresses the phenotype of the mcs wee cdc strain, but also that of a win wee cdc strain at high temperature, indicating that the function of spo is not directly related to mcs. we show that spo mrna is periodically expressed during the fission yeast cell cycle, peaking at the g/m transition coincidently with cdc. deletion of spo, however, has no overt effect on either the mitotic or meiotic cell cycles, except when the function of the major b type cyclin, cdc, is compromised.
