interactions among the subunits of the g protein involved in saccharomyces cerevisiae mating.. . the scg (gpa), ste, and ste genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae encode mating pathway components whose amino acid sequences are similar to those of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, respectively, of mammalian g proteins. genetic evidence suggests that the ste and ste gene products interact. the mating defects of a set of ste mutants were partially suppressed by the overexpression of ste, and, moreover, a combination of partially defective ste and ste alleles created a totally sterile phenotype, whereas such synthetic sterility was not observed when the ste allele was combined with a weakly sterile ste allele. others have provided genetic evidence consistent with an interaction between the scg (gpa) and ste gene products. we have examined the physical interactions of these subunits by using an in vivo protein association assay. the ste and ste gene products associated with each other, and this association was disrupted by a mutation in the ste gene product whose phenotype was partially suppressed by overexpression of ste. the ste and scg (gpa) gene products also interacted in the assay, whereas we detected no association of the scg (gpa) and ste gene products.
