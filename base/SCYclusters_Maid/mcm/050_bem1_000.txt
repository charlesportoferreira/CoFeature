molecular recognition in dimerization between pb domains.. . the pb (phox and bem ) domain is a recently identified module that mediates formation of a heterodimeric complex with other pb domain, e.g. the complexes between the phagocyte oxidase activators pphox and pphox and between the yeast polarity proteins bemp and cdcp. these pb domains harbor either a conserved lysine residue on one side or an acidic opca (opr/pc/aid) motif around the other side; the lysine of pphox or bemp likely binds to the opca of pphox or cdcp, respectively, via electrostatic interactions. to further understand molecular recognition by pb domains, here we investigate the interactions mediated by proteins presenting both the lysine and opca on a single pb domain, namely par, atypical protein kinase c (apkc), and zip. par and apkc form a complex via the interaction of the par lysine with apkc opca but not via that between the apkc lysine and par opca, thereby localizing to the tight junction of epithelial cells. apkc also uses its opca to interact with zip, another protein that has a pb domain presenting both the lysine and opca, whereas apkc binds via the conserved lysine to mek in the same manner as zip interacts with mek. in addition, zip can form a homotypic complex via the conserved electrostatic interactions. thus the pb domain appears to be a protein module that fully exploits its two mutually interacting elements in molecular recognition to expand its repertoire of protein protein interactions.
