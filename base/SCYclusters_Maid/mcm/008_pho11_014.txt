genetic evidence of a new flocculation suppressor gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the flocculation character in strain im b of saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by a single and dominant gene shown to be allelic to flo. such a gene has been both mitotically and meiotically mapped on the right arm of chromosome i at . cm from pho. the phenotype was suppressed by a single gene of wide distribution among non flocculent strains (proposed as fsu) that, however, was unable to suppress other flo genes in other flocculent strains.
