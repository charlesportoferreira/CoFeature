mapk specificity in the yeast pheromone response independent of transcriptional activation.. . the mechanisms whereby different external cues stimulate the same mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade, yet trigger an appropriately distinct biological response, epitomize the conundrum of specificity in cell signaling. in yeast, shared upstream components of the mating pheromone and filamentous growth pathways activate two related mapks, fus and kss, which in turn regulate programs of gene expression via the transcription factor ste. as fus, but not kss, strains are impaired for mating, fus exhibits specificity for the pheromone response. to account for this specificity, it has been suggested that fus physically occludes kss from pheromone activated signaling complexes, which are formed on the scaffold protein ste. however, we find that genome wide expression profiles of pheromone treated wild type, fus, and kss deletion strains are highly correlated for all induced genes and, further, that two catalytically inactive versions of fus fail to abrogate the pheromone induced transcriptional response. consistently, fus and kss kinase activity is induced to an equivalent extent in pheromone treated cells. in contrast, both in vivo and in an in vitro reconstituted mapk system, fus, but not kss, exhibits strong substrate selectivity toward far, a bifunctional protein required for polarization and g() arrest. this effect accounts for the failure to repress g() s specific transcription in fus strains and, in part, explains the mating defect of such strains. mapk specificity in the pheromone response evidently occurs primarily at the substrate level, as opposed to specific kinase activation by dedicated signaling complexes.
