gaip is membrane anchored by palmitoylation and interacts with the activated (gtp bound) form of g alpha i subunits.. . gaip (g alpha interacting protein) is a member of the recently described rgs (regulators of g protein signaling) family that was isolated by interaction cloning with the heterotrimeric g protein g alpha i and was recently shown to be a gtpase activating protein (gap). in att cells stably expressing gaip, we found that gaip is membrane anchored and faces the cytoplasm, because it was not released by sodium carbonate treatment but was digested by proteinase k. when cos cells were transiently transfected with gaip and metabolically labeled with [s]methionine, two pools of gaip a soluble and a membrane anchored pool were found. since the n terminus of gaip contains a cysteine string motif and cysteine string proteins are heavily palmitoylated, we investigated the possibility that membrane anchored gaip might be palmitoylated. we found that after labeling with [h]palmitic acid, the membrane anchored pool but not the soluble pool was palmitoylated. in the yeast two hybrid system, gaip was found to interact specifically with members of the g alpha i subfamily, g alpha i, g alpha i, g alpha i, g alpha z, and g alpha o, but not with members of other g alpha subfamilies, g alpha s, g alpha q, and g alpha /. the c terminus of g alpha i is important for binding because a aa c terminal truncation and a point mutant of g alpha i showed significantly diminished interaction. gaip interacted preferentially with the activated (gtp) form of g alpha i, which is in keeping with its gap activity. we conclude that gaip is a membrane anchored gap with a cysteine string motif. this motif, present in cysteine string proteins found on synaptic vesicles, pancreatic zymogen granules, and chromaffin granules, suggests gaip's possible involvement in membrane trafficking.
