characterization of recombinant human and rat pancreatic phospholipases a secreted from saccharomyces cerevisiae. difference in proteolytic processing.. . an expression plasmid for human pancreatic phospholipase a in saccharomyces cerevisiae was constructed by insertion of cdna encoding its preprophospholipase a into a yeast expression vector pam. the resulting product secreted in the yeast culture medium was mainly prophospholipase a, which was the same as the natural proenzyme in all aspects examined, including the higher order structure. however, when the rat preprophospholipase a cdna was manipulated in the same manner, the active phospholipase a of the intact mature form was secreted with the proenzyme being hardly detected in the medium. this unexpected favorable result would occur due to cleavage of rat phospholipase a pro peptide by a trypsin like proteinase in s. cerevisiae. based on this finding, we constructed a plasmid carrying the sequence coding for the prepro peptide of rat pancreatic phospholipase a behind the pho promoter in the pam vector, which leads to the secretion of heterologous proteins as their mature form. the use of this plasmid led to secretion of biologically active human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor and a glutamic acid specific endopeptidase from staphylococcus aureus atcc , which are eukaryote and prokaryote proteins, respectively, in the culture medium of s. cerevisiae.
