molecular and expression analysis of the negative regulators involved in the transcriptional regulation of acid phosphatase production in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the pho and pho gene products encode proteins necessary for the repression of transcription from the major acid phosphatase gene (pho) of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the deduced amino acid sequences of these genes have revealed that pho is likely to encode a protein kinase, whereas no potential function has been revealed for pho. we undertook several approaches to aid in the elucidation of the pho function, including deletion analysis, chemical mutagenesis, and expression analysis. dna deletion analysis revealed that residues from both the carboxy and amino terminal regions of the protein, amounting to a total of % of the pho protein, were not required for function with respect to repressor activity. also, independent single amino acid changes within pho which resulted in the failure to repress pho transcription were isolated. nine of the missense mutations resided in two subregions of the pho molecule. in addition, expression analysis of the pho and pho genes suggested that the pho gene product was not necessary for pho expression and that the pho gene was expressed at much higher levels in the cell than was the pho gene. furthermore, high levels of pho were shown to suppress the effect of a pho deletion at a level close to full repression. implications for the function of the negative regulators in this system are discussed.
