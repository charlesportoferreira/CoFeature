analysis of the receptor binding domain of gpap, the g(alpha) subunit involved in the yeast pheromone response pathway.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae g protein alpha subunit gpap is involved in the response of both mata and mat alpha cells to pheromone. we mutagenized the gpa c terminus to characterize the receptor interacting domain and to investigate the specificity of the interactions with the a and alpha factor receptors. the results are discussed with respect to a structural model of the gpap c terminus that was based on the crystal structure of bovine transducin. some mutants showed phenotypes different than the pheromone response and mating defects expected for mutations that affect receptor interactions, and therefore the mutations may affect other aspects of gpap function. most of the mutations that resulted in pheromone response and mating defects had similar effects in mata and mat alpha cells, suggesting that they affect the interactions with both receptors. overexpression of the pheromone receptors increased the mating of some of the mutants tested but not the wild type strain, consistent with defects in mutant gpap receptor interactions. the regions identified by the mating defective mutants correlated well with the regions of mammalian g(alpha) subunits implicated in receptor interactions. the strongest mating type specific effects were seen for mutations to proline and a mutation of a glycine residue predicted to form a c terminal beta turn. the analogous beta turn in mammalian g(alpha) subunits undergoes a conformational change upon receptor interaction. we propose that the conformation of this region of gpap differs during the interactions with the a and alpha factor receptors and that these mating type specific mutations preclude the orientation necessary for interaction with one of the two receptors.
