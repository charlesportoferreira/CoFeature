the saccharomyces cerevisiae ade gene. structure, overexpression and possible regulation by general amino acid control.. . the ade gene of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has been cloned by complementation of the ade mutation. the nucleotide sequence has been determined for the bp coding region, bp ' noncoding region and bp ' noncoding region. the sequenced region includes a single large open reading frame coding for a protein of amino acid (aa) residues. the promoter of the ade gene contains a copy of the ' tgactc hexanucleotide, a feature characteristic of promoters under general aa control. subsequent search of other published purine biosynthesis gene sequences revealed that all of them also contain general aa control signals in their promoter regions. an expression plasmid containing the ade coding region under control of the pho promoter produced n succinyl aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (saicar) synthetase in yeast cells at a level of % of total cellular protein. one step purification resulted in an almost homogeneous preparation of saicar synthetase.
