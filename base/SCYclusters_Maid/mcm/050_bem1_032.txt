pheromone response in yeast. association of bemp with proteins of the map kinase cascade and actin.. . haploid cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae respond to mating pheromones with polarized growth toward the mating partner. this morphological response requires the function of the cell polarity establishment protein bemp. immunochemical and two hybrid protein interaction assays revealed that bemp interacts with two components of the pheromone responsive mitogen activated protein (map) kinase cascade, step and step, as well as with actin. mutants of bemp that are associated with defective pheromone induced polarized morphogenesis interacted with step and actin but not with step. thus, the association of bemp with step and step may contribute to the conveyance of spatial information that regulates polarized rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton during yeast mating.
