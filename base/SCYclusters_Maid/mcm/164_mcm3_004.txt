unusual genome organisation in entamoeba histolytica leads to two overlapping transcripts.. . we have isolated homologs of the mini chromosome maintenance (mcm) gene family from the parasitic protozoan entamoeba histolytica. the full length genomic and cdna clones for the eh mcm gene have been characterised. the eh mcm gene is much smaller than the saccharomyces cerevisiae mcm gene and other eukaryotic homologs of the mcm/p family. the predicted eh mcm protein was amino acids long and showed and % positional identity with the sc mcm and the mouse p homologs respectively. while proceeding along the chromosome from the eh mcm gene, we have identified a homolog (eh pak) of the murine p activated kinase (rn kpak), or s. cerevisiae ste. eh pak lies bp upstream of the eh mcm gene. the predicted eh p activated kinase protein was amino acids long and showed % positional identity with the murine p activated kinase and its yeast homolog ste. analysis of cdna and genomic sequences shows that the ' untranslated region (utr) of the eh pak mrna and the ' utr of the eh mcm mrna are transcribed from a common bp genomic segment. this is the first report of an amoeba gene being physically linked to a second gene such that their transcripts are overlapping and there is no non transcribed intergenic region between the two genes. primer extension studies have confirmed that unlike most e. histolytica genes, which have short ' utrs, the eh mcm mrna has a bp long ' utr and the eh pak mrna has a bp long ' utr.
