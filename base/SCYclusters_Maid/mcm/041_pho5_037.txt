cooperative pho pho interactions at the pho promoter are critical for binding of pho to uasp and for efficient transactivation by pho at uasp.. . the activation of the pho gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to phosphate starvation critically depends on two transcriptional activators, the basic helix loop helix protein pho and the homeodomain protein pho. pho acts through two essential binding sites corresponding to the regulatory elements uasp and uasp. mutation of either of them results in a fold decrease in promoter activity, and mutation of both sites renders the promoter totally uninducible. the role of pho appears relatively straightforward, but the mechanism of action of pho had remained elusive. by in vitro footprinting, we have recently mapped multiple pho binding sites adjacent to the pho sites, and by mutating them individually or in combination, we now show that each of them contributes to pho promoter activity. their function is not only to recruit pho to the promoter but to allow cooperative binding of pho together with pho. cooperativity requires dna binding of pho to its target sites and pho pho interactions. a pho derivative lacking the pho interaction domain is unable to activate the promoter, but testing of uasp and uasp individually in a minimal cyc promoter reveals a striking difference between the two uas elements. uasp is fully inactive, presumably because the pho derivative is not recruited to its binding site. in contrast, uasp activates strongly in a pho independent manner. from in vivo footprinting experiments and activity measurements with a promoter variant containing two uasp elements, we conclude that at uasp, pho is mainly required for the ability of pho to transactivate.
