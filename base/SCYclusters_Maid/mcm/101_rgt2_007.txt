rag gene encodes a glucose sensor in kluyveromyces lactis.. . the rag mutant of kluyveromyces lactis was previously isolated as a fermentation deficient mutant, in which transcription of the major glucose transporter gene rag was affected. the wild type rag was cloned by complementation of the rag mutation and found to encode a protein homologous to snf and rgt of saccharomyces cerevisiae. these two proteins are thought to be sensors of low and high concentrations of glucose, respectively. rag, like snf and rgt, is predicted to have the transmembrane structure of sugar transporter family proteins as well as a long c terminal cytoplasmic tail possessing a characteristic amino acid sequence. rag may therefore be expected to have a glucose sensing function. however, the rag mutation was fully complemented by one copy of either snf or rgt. since k. lactis appears to have no other genes of the snf/rgt type, we suggest that rag of k. lactis may have a dual function of signaling high and low concentrations of glucose. in rag mutants, glucose repression of several inducible enzymes is abolished.
