functional expression of m(), m() and m() muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in yeast.. . the goal of this study was to functionally express the three g(q) coupled muscarinic receptor subtypes, m(), m() and m(), in yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). transformation of yeast with expression constructs coding for the full length receptors resulted in very low numbers of detectable muscarinic binding sites (b(max) &lt; fmol/mg). strikingly, deletion of the central portion of the third intracellular loops of the m(), m() and m() muscarinic receptors resulted in dramatic increases in b(max) values ( fmol/mg). to monitor productive receptor/g protein coupling, we used specifically engineered yeast strains that required agonist stimulated receptor/g protein coupling for cell growth. these studies showed that the shortened versions of the m(), m() and m() receptors were unable to productively interact with the endogenous yeast g protein alpha subunit, gpap, or a gpa mutant subunit that contained c terminal mammalian galpha(s) sequence. in contrast, all three receptors gained the ability to efficiently couple to a gpa/galpha(q) hybrid subunit containing c terminal mammalian galpha(q) sequence, indicating that the m(), m() and m() muscarinic receptors retained proper g protein coupling selectivity in yeast. this is the first study to report the expression of muscarinic receptors in a coupling competent form in yeast. the strategy described here, which involves structural modification of both receptors and co expressed g proteins, should facilitate the functional expression of other classes of g protein coupled receptors in yeast.
