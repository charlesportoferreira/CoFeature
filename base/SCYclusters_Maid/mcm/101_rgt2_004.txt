glucose sensing mechanisms in eukaryotic cells.. . glucose not only serves as a nutrient but also exerts many hormone like regulatory effects in a wide variety of eukaryotic cell types. recently, interest in identifying general mechanisms and principles used to sense the presence of glucose has significantly increased and promising advances have been made. in yeast, the first proteins with an apparently specific function in glucose detection have been discovered; in plant cells, there is increasing evidence for a diverse array of glucose induced signalling mechanisms; and in mammals, glucose sensing phenomena have turned out to be much more widespread than just in the well known example of pancreatic beta cells.
