novel modular domain pb recognizes pc motif to mediate functional protein protein interactions.. . modular domains mediating specific protein protein interactions play central roles in the formation of complex regulatory networks to execute various cellular activities. here we identify a novel domain pb in the budding yeast protein bemp, which functions in polarity establishment, and mammalian p(phox), which activates the microbicidal phagocyte nadph oxidase. each of these specifically recognizes an evolutionarily conserved pc motif to interact directly with cdcp (an essential protein for cell polarization) and p(phox) (a component of the signaling complex for the oxidase), respectively. swapping the pb domain of bemp with that of p(phox), which abolishes its interaction with cdcp, confers on cells temperature sensitive growth and a bilateral mating defect. these phenotypes are suppressed by a mutant cdcp harboring the pc motif containing region of p(phox), which restores the interaction with the altered bemp. this domain swapping experiment demonstrates that bemp function requires interaction with cdcp, in which the pb domain and the pc motif participate as responsible modules.
