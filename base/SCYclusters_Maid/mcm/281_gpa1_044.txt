identification of ras farnesyltransferase inhibitors by microbial screening.. . a microbial screen using a yeast strain with conditional deficiency in the gpa gene was carried out to search for inhibitors of protein farnesyltransferase (pft). a strain of streptomyces was found to produce active compounds named ucf a, ucf b, and ucf c. structural determination of these compounds revealed that ucf c is identical to the known antibiotic, manumycin, whereas ucf a and ucf b are structurally related to manumycin. all three ucf compounds suppress the lethality of gpa disruption, with ucf c exhibiting the strongest activity. ucf inhibits yeast as well as rat brain pft. fifty percent inhibition of yeast pft activity is observed with microm ucf c. kinetic analyses of the inhibition suggest that ucf c acts as a competitive inhibitor of pft with respect to farnesyl pyrophosphate, exhibiting a ki of . microm, whereas the same compound appears to act as a noncompetitive inhibitor of pft with respect to the farnesyl acceptor, the ras protein. ucf c shows significant activity to inhibit the growth of ki ras transformed fibrosarcoma, raising the possibility of its use as an antitumor drug.
