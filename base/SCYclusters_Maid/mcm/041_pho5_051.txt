elevated expression of stress response genes resulting from deletion of the pho gene.. . the cyclin dependent protein kinase pho is a known negative regulatory factor for two stress response genes, pho and gsy, which encode the inducible form of acid phosphatase and glycogen synthase, respectively, in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. cells carrying a disruption of the pho gene inappropriately express both pho and gsy, resulting in the increase in phosphate scavenging and hyperaccumulation of glycogen in nutrient rich conditions. constitutive activation of pka in a pho mutant suppresses the hyperaccumulation of glycogen. this work presents data to show that, at least in part, the suppression of glycogen biosynthesis upon activation of pka in a pho mutant results from the suppression of gsy expression. in addition to gsy, disruption of the pho gene inappropriately triggers the derepression of two other stress response genes, hsp and ubi. at least in the case of gsy, regulation of transcription by pho is not through the stress responsive cis promoter elements (stre). furthermore, pho may associate with the known cyclin pho in the transcriptional regulation of these genes.
