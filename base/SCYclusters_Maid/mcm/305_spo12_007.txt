spo and sit suppress mutations in dbf, which encodes a cell cycle protein kinase that is periodically expressed.. . to help clarify the role of dbf, a previously described cell cycle protein kinase, high copy number suppressors of the dbf mutation were isolated. three open reading frames (orf) have been identified. one orf encodes a protein which has homology to a human small nuclear riboprotein, while the remaining two are genes which have been identified previously, sit and spo. sit is known to have a role in the cell cycle but the nature of the interaction between sit and dbf is unclear. spo has until now been implicated exclusively in meiosis. however, we show that spo is expressed during vegetative growth, moreover it is expressed under cell cycle control coordinately with dbf. spo is a nonessential gene, but it becomes essential in a dbf delete genetic background. furthermore, detailed analysis of the cell cycle of spo delete cells revealed a small but significant delay in mitosis. therefore, spo does have a role during vegetative growth and it probably functions in mitosis in association with dbf.
