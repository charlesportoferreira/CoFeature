structure and ligand recognition of the pb domain. a novel protein module binding to the pc motif.. . pb domains are novel protein modules capable of binding to target proteins that contain pc motifs. we report here the nmr structure and ligand binding site of the pb domain of the cell polarity establishment protein, bemp. in addition, we identify the topology of the pc motif containing region of cdcp by nmr, another cell polarity establishment protein that interacts with bemp. the pc motif containing region is a structural domain offering a scaffold to the pc motif. the chemical shift perturbation experiment and the mutagenesis study show that the pc motif is a major structural element that binds to the pb domain. a structural database search reveals close similarity between the bemp pb domain and the c raf ras binding domain. however, these domains are functionally distinct from each other.
