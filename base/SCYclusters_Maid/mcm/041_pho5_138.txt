the sequence of the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene pho codes for a regulatory protein with unusual aminoacid composition.. . a new centromere vector for the construction of a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene library, allowing direct selection for dna insert, will be described. from that library the gene for the regulatory protein pho involved in pho induction has been cloned by complementation of a pho mutation. the complementing activity was shown to be located on a . kb hindiii fragment. this fragment was used to evict the genomic copy and with appropriate genetic crosses we proved, that the cloned gene is pho. the dna sequence of pho was determined. analysis of the sequence data uncovered striking homology regions with pho, another protein necessary for the induction of pho. the relevance of the observed homology will be discussed.
