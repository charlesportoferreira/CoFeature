tafp, a non histone like subunit of tfiid and saga complexes, is essential for total mrna gene transcription in vivo.. . we demonstrate, utilizing a temperature conditional mutant allele of the gene encoding tafp, that this non histone like tbp associated factor, which is shared between the tfiid and saga complexes, is required for bulk mrna gene transcription by rna polymerase ii in vivo. immunoblotting experiments indicate that at the restrictive temperature, inactivation of tafp function results in a reduction of the levels of numerous tfiid and saga subunits, indicating its loss of function, like the histone like tafs, causes degradation of the constituents of these two multisubunit complexes. these data suggest that tafp plays a key structural role in maintaining tfiid and saga complex integrity. this is the first demonstration that a non histone like taf is required for continuous, high level rna polymerase ii mediated mrna gene transcription in living yeast cells.
