functional analysis of six orfs from saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome iv. two spored asci produced by disruptant of ydrc and strain dependent dna heterogeneity around ydrc.. . six s. cerevisiae fy heterozygous deletion mutants were made by replacing six open reading frames (orfs) of the chromosome iv right arm with kanmx selection marker. haploid and homozygous diploid deletion mutants were obtained from sporulation, dissection and mating experiments. no essential genes were found. the basic phenotypic analysis showed that the haploid and homozygous deletants for the orf ydrc (luv, vsp or rki) grew slowly. the diploid homozygous deletants for this orf had a low frequency of sporulation. they produced asci with no more than one or two haploid spores and the majority of these spores formed were not viable. the deletion of the other orfs, ydrc (cis), ydrc (rad), ydrc (pst), ydrw (mrh) and ydrc, did not change the phenotypes tested in strain fy or the first four orfs in strain cen.pk. this work showed some differences in the dna sequences between fy and cen.pk. the regions immediately kb upstream from ydrc in these two strains are too different to hybridize properly, preventing deletion of ydrc in the cen.pk background by recombination with a disruption cassette designed for fy. in addition, there are different sets of transposable elements on the other side of the orf, the differences starting at about . kb downstream from ydrc. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
