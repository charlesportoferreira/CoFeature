two glucose sensing/signaling pathways stimulate glucose induced inactivation of maltose permease in saccharomyces.. . glucose is a global metabolic regulator in saccharomyces. it controls the expression of many genes involved in carbohydrate utilization at the level of transcription, and it induces the inactivation of several enzymes by a posttranslational mechanism. snf, rgt, grr and rgt are known to be involved in glucose regulation of transcription. we tested the roles of these genes in glucose induced inactivation of maltose permease. our results suggest that at least two signaling pathways are used to monitor glucose levels. one pathway requires glucose sensor transcript and the second pathway is independent of glucose transport. rgtp, which along with snfp monitors extracellular glucose levels, appears to be the glucose sensor for the glucose transport independent pathway. transmission of the rgtp dependent signal requires grrp. rgt and grr also play a role in regulating the expression of the hxt genes, which appear to be the upstream components of the glucose transport dependent pathway regulating maltose permease inactivation. rgt , which was identified as a dominant mutation causing constitutive expression of several hxt genes, causes constitutive proteolysis of maltose permease, that is, in the absence of glucose. a model of these glucose sensing/signaling pathways is presented.
