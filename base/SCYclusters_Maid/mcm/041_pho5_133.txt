expression of env sequences of the bovine leukemia virus (blv) in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dna sequences of the envelope (env) gene of the bovine leukemia virus (blv) were expressed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. two yeast promoters, the repressible pho promoter and the constitutive pgk promoter, were used to construct four expression plasmids comprising either a sequence of the surface antigen gp or a (gp + gp) sequence. the expressed heterologous gene products were characterized by western blot analysis and competitive radioimmunoassay. by means of northern blot analysis the steady state level of env specific mrna was analysed. the highest expression rate was obtained from recombinant plasmid yepsg comprising a gp sequence a base pair fragment containing % of the gp but lacking the n terminus as well as the pho promoter including pho signal sequence and the pho terminator. the recombinant gp was partially glycosylated but the pho signal peptide did not seem to be cleaved off. no immunoreactive material could be found in the periplasm or in the culture medium. by means of monoclonal antibodies directed against eight different epitopes of viral gp, all four sequential antigenic determinants were detected in the ah (yepsg ) expression product.
