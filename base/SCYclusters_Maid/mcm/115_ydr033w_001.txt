functional characterization of the s. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis.. . the functions of many open reading frames (orfs) identified in genome sequencing projects are unknown. new, whole genome approaches are required to systematically determine their function. a total of saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were constructed, by a high throughput strategy, each with a precise deletion of one of orfs (more than one third of the orfs in the genome). of the deleted orfs, percent were essential for viability in rich medium. the phenotypes of more than deletion strains were assayed in parallel. of the deletion strains, percent showed quantitative growth defects in either rich or minimal medium.
