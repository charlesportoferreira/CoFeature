the mat locus revisited within a . kb fragment of chromosome iii containing bud and two new open reading frames.. . this paper reports the dna sequence of a segment of . kb of the chromosome iii. the sequenced dna contains the mat alpha locus. the new sequence of the mat alpha locus differs from the previously reported sequence by six modifications in the w segment. we have found the same modifications in the hml locus. the corrected sequence contains, in hml, an open reading frame (orf) of codons which ends at the border between the w segment and the flanking dna. in the mat locus, this orf extends in the flanking dna up to codons. this orf corresponds to a gene independently identified as bud (chant et al., ). this gene presents homologies with the exchange factors sdc and cdc. a large orf of codons is found on the opposite side of mat alpha (toward the telomere). this orf corresponds to a new gene ycr. next to this gene is a small orf, ycr, of codons. the localization of this fragment on chromosome iii, originally supposed to be distal from the mat locus based on genetic distance, illustrates variation in recombination frequency along the chromosome and suggests the existence of hot spots of recombination between mat and the thr locus.
