identification of the essential epe gene involved in retention of secreted proteins on the cell surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells secrete extracellularly low amounts of a few proteins. the reasons for retardation of secreted proteins on the cell surface remain obscure. we describe here a mutant able to export enhanced amount of proteins. classical genetic methods, nucleic acids manipulations and cloning procedures were used to isolate and characterize the mutant and to clone and sequence the corresponding wild type gene. the isolated saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant mw, is temperature sensitive and exports on average twenty fold more proteins at degrees c than parental wild type strain ( micrograms of proteins/ x () mutant cells, sem +/ , n; versus micrograms of proteins/ x () parental cells, sem +/ , n). protein overexport in the mutant requires a functional sec pathway and is independent of cell lysis. cloning and sequencing of the corresponding wild type gene identified an open reading frame of bp coding for a hydrophilic protein with predicted molecular mass of kda and cytosolic localization. the newly identified gene, designated epe, is an essential gene. its dna and amino acids sequence showed no homology with other yeast genes and proteins. it is concluded that the function of unknown yet genes, such as epe is needed for retention of secreted proteins on the surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.
