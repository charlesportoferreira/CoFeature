regulation of initiation of s phase, replication checkpoint signaling, and maintenance of mitotic chromosome structures during s phase by hsk kinase in the fission yeast.. . hsk, saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc related kinase in shizosaccharomyces pombe, is required for g/s transition and its kinase activity is controlled by the regulatory subunit dfp/him. analyses of a newly isolated temperature sensitive mutant, hsk , reveal that hsk plays crucial roles in dna replication checkpoint signaling and maintenance of proper chromatin structures during mitotic s phase through regulating the functions of rad (atm) cds and rad (cohesin), respectively, in addition to expected essential roles for initiation of mitotic dna replication through phosphorylating cdc (mcm). checkpoint defect in hsk is indicated by accumulation of cut cells at degrees c. hsk displays synthetic lethality in combination with rad deletion, indicating that survival of hsk depends on rad dependent checkpoint pathway. cds kinase activation, which normally occurs in response to early s phase arrest by nucleotide deprivation, is largely impaired in hsk . furthermore, cds dependent hyperphosphorylation of dfp in response to hydroxyurea arrest is eliminated in hsk , suggesting that sufficient activation of hsk dfp kinase is required for s phase entry and replication checkpoint signaling. hsk displays apparent defect in mitosis at degrees c leading to accumulation of cells with near c dna content and with aberrant nuclear structures. these phenotypes are similar to those of rad k and are significantly enhanced in a hsk rad k double mutant. consistent with essential roles of rad as a component for the cohesin complex, sister chromatid cohesion is partially impaired in hsk , suggesting a possibility that infrequent origin firing of the mutant may affect the cohesin functions during s phase.
