genes that allow yeast cells to grow in the absence of the hdel receptor.. . the erd gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the hdel receptor that sorts er proteins; it is essential for growth. in the absence of erdp the golgi apparatus is both functionally and morphologically perturbed. here we describe the isolation of four sed genes (suppressors of the erd deletion) which, when present in multiple copies, allow cells to grow in the absence of erd. the suppressed strains secrete the er protein bip and their internal membranes show a variety of morphological abnormalities. sequence analysis indicates that all these sed genes encode membrane proteins. sed encodes a probable cell surface glycoprotein; sed is identical to sec, a gene required for the formation of er derived transport vesicles; sed encodes a protein whose cytoplasmic domain is % identical to that of secp; sed is dpm, the structural gene for dolichol p mannose synthase. we suggest that the absence of erd causes an imbalance between membrane flow into and out of the golgi apparatus, and that the sed gene products can compensate for this either by slowing transport from the er or by stimulating vesicle budding from golgi membranes.
