identification, characterization and chromosomal localization of the cognate human and murine dbf genes.. . the kinase dbfp/cdcp is required for the g/s phase transition during the cell cycle and plays a direct role in the activation of individual origins of replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, we report the identification and characterization of mouse and human cdnas whose products are related in sequence to saccharomyces cerevisiae dbf cdna. both mammalian dbf proteins contain a putative site for phosphorylation by cdk, pest protease cleavage sites, nuclear localization signals and a short looped zinc finger like domain. transcription of mmdbf is suppressed in mouse niht fibroblasts made quiescent by serum starvation. upon replenishment of the medium, transcript levels increase during progression through g, peaking as cells enter s phase. mmdbfp interacts physically with cdcp and mcmp in vivo. using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), the human dbf gene was localized to chromosome (q.), whereas fish mapped the murine counterpart to band a on chromosome . the results of chromosome mapping indicate that in both mouse and human the gene is present as a single copy. the structural conservation between dbf related proteins suggests that these proteins play a key role in the regulation of dna replication during the cell cycle in all eukaryotes.
