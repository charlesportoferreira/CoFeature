the cdc phosphatase is functionally associated with the dbf protein kinase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc protein phosphatase and dbf protein kinase have been implicated to act during late m phase, but their functions are not known. we report here that cdc is a low copy suppressor of the dbf mutation at degrees c. the kinase activity of dbf accumulated at a high level, in vivo, during a cdc arrest and was also much higher in cdc mutant cells at the permissive temperature of growth, therefore in cycling mutant cells than in cycling wild type cells. this correlated with the accumulation of the more slowly migrating form of dbf, previously shown to correspond to the hyperphosphorylated form of the protein. the finding that the dbf mutation could be rescued following overproduction of catalytically inactive forms of cdc suggested that the control of dbf activity by cdc might be only indirect and independent of cdc phosphatase activity. however, it was found that cdc could form oligomers within the cell, thus leaving open the possibility that catalytically inactive cdc might associate with wild type cdc and rescue dbf in a phosphatase dependent manner. we confirmed that overexpression of cdc could rescue mutations in cdc, which encodes another kinase also implicated to act in late m phase. cells of a cdc dbf double mutant died at temperatures much lower than did either single mutant, whereas there was only a slight additive phenotype in the cdc dbf and cdc cdc double mutant cells. finally, functional association between cdc and dbf (and also cdc) was confirmed by the finding that the cdc, dbf and cdc mutations could be partially rescued by the addition of . m sorbitol to the culture medium. our data are the first to demonstrate a functional link between cdc and dbf based on both biochemical and genetic information.
