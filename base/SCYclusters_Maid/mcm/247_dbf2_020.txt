dbf, a cell cycle regulated protein kinase, is physically and functionally associated with the ccr transcriptional regulatory complex.. . ccr, a general transcriptional regulator affecting the expression of a number of genes in yeast, forms a multi subunit complex in vivo. using the yeast two hybrid screen, we have identified dbf, a cell cycle regulated protein kinase, as a ccr associated protein. dbf is required for cell cycle progression at the telophase to g cell cycle transition. dbf co immunoprecipitated with ccr and caf/pop, a ccr associated factor, and co purified with the ccr complex. moreover, a dbf disruption resulted in phenotypes and transcriptional defects similar to those observed in strains deficient for ccr or caf. ccr and caf mutations, on the other hand, were found to affect cell cycle progression in a manner similar to that observed for dbf defects. these data indicate that dbf is involved in the control of gene expression and suggest that the ccr complex regulates transcription during the late mitotic part of the cell cycle.
