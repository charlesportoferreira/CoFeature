effect of the pheromone responsive g(alpha) and phosphatase proteins of saccharomyces cerevisiae on the subcellular localization of the fus mitogen activated protein kinase.. . the mating specific g(alpha) protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae, gpa, stimulates adaptation to pheromone by a mechanism independent of g(beta gamma) sequestration. genetic evidence suggests that gpa targets the fus mitogen activated protein kinase, and it has recently been shown that the two proteins interact in cells responding to pheromone. to test the possibility that gpa downregulates the mating signal by affecting the localization of fus, we created a fus green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion protein. in vegetative cells, fus gfp was found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. pheromone stimulated a measurable increase in the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic fus gfp. in contrast, the relative level of nuclear fus gfp decreased as cells recovered from pheromone arrest and did not increase when cells adapted to chronic stimulus were challenged again. accumulation of fus gfp in the nuclei of stimulated cells was also inhibited by overexpression of either wild type gpa, the ek hyperadaptive mutant form of gpa, or the msg dually specific phosphatase. the effects of gpa and msg on fus are partially interdependent. in a genetic screen for adaptive defective mutants, a nonsense allele of the nucleocytoplasmic transport receptor, kap, was identified. truncation of the kap cargo binding domain blocked the effect of both gpa(ek) and msg on fus gfp localization. based on these results, we propose that gpa and msg work in concert to downregulate the mating signal and that they do so by inhibiting the pheromone induced increase of fus in the nucleus. kap is required for the g(alpha)/phosphatase mediated effect on fus localization.
