nuclear import of spop, a protein essential for meiosis.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, spop is involved in mitosis and is essential for meiosis. we found that spop is imported into the nucleus by the karyopherin kapp. a complex containing spop and kapp was isolated from cytosol and was also reconstituted with recombinant proteins, indicating that this interaction is direct. spop was mislocalized to the cytosol in pse , a temperature sensitive strain harboring a mutation of kapp, at the permissive temperature, confirming an essential role for kapp in spop import. spop was also mislocalized in a pse /pse homozygous strain, suggesting it is imported via the same pathway in diploid cells. furthermore, we found that pse /pse shows a sporulation defect similar to that of spodelta/spodelta. in addition, we have characterized the spop nuclear localization signal, mapped it to residues , and identified residues within this region that are important for nuclear localization signal function.
