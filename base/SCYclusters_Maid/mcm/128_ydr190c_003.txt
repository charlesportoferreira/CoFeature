rvbp and rvbp are essential components of a chromatin remodeling complex that regulates transcription of over % of yeast genes.. . eukaryotic rvbp and rvbp are two highly conserved proteins related to the helicase subset of the aaa+ family of atpases. conditional mutants in both genes show rapid changes in the transcription of over % of yeast genes, with a similar number of genes being repressed and activated. both rvbp and rvbp are required for maintaining the induced state of many inducible promoters. atp binding and hydrolysis by rvbp and rvbp is individually essential in vivo, and the two proteins are associated with each other in a high molecular weight complex that shows atp dependent chromatin remodeling activity in vitro. our findings show that rvbp and rvbp are essential components of a chromatin remodeling complex and determine genes regulated by the complex.
