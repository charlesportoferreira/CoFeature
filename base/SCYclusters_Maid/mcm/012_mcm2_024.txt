cell cycle control of cdcp kinase activity through regulation of dbfp stability.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the heteromeric kinase complex cdcp dbfp plays a pivotal role at replication origins in triggering the initiation of dna replication during the s phase. we have assayed the kinase activity of endogenous levels of cdcp kinase by using a likely physiological target, mcmp, as a substrate. using this assay, we have confirmed that cdcp kinase activity fluctuates during the cell cycle; it is low in the g phase, rises as cells enter the s phase, and remains high until cells complete mitosis. these changes in kinase activity cannot be accounted for by changes in the levels of the catalytic subunit cdcp, as these levels are constant during the cell cycle. however, the fluctuations in kinase activity do correlate with levels of the regulatory subunit dbfp. the regulation of dbfp levels can be attributed in part to increased degradation of the protein in g cells. this g phase instability is cdc dependent, suggesting a role of the anaphase promoting complex in the turnover of dbfp. overexpression of dbfp in the g phase can partially overcome this elevated turnover and lead to an increase in cdcp kinase activity. thus, the regulation of dbfp levels through the control of dbfp degradation has an important role in the regulation of cdcp kinase activity during the cell cycle.
