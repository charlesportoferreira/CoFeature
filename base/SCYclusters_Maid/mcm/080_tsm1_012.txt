the tsm gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae overlaps the mat locus.. . we have cloned the region from mat to thr on chromosome iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae. although the region is only kb, the two loci are genetically separated by cm. this is in sharp contrast to the very low level of recombination ( cm in kb) that is observed in the adjacent cry mat interval, and suggests that there may be a &quot;hot spot&quot; for recombination in the mat thr region. the dna sequence of the first . kb distal to mat reveals an open reading frame that we have identified as the essential gene, tsm. surprisingly, the tsm open reading frame of , amino acids extends into the mat locus, such that the ' end of the mat alpha transcript ends bp from the ' end of the tsm open reading frame.
