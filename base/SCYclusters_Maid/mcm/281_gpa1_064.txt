role of sgp, a suppressor of a gpa mutation, in the mating factor signaling pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . loss of function of gpa, which encodes a guanine nucleotide binding protein, arrests the cell at the g phase and allows it to mate, suggesting that the gpa mutation spontaneously exerts an intracellular signal that mimics the action of mating factor. we have cloned the sgp gene, which was first identified as a secondary mutation that allowed a gpa.his mutant to grow and to show a non cell type specific sterile phenotype. disruption of sgp confers temperature sensitive growth and a specific sterile phenotypes, characteristics similar to those conferred by the dpr (ram) mutation, a suppressor of rasval . the following observations indicate that sgp and dpr are in fact identical. (i) the cloned sgp complements both the temperature sensitive growth and the a specific sterility of the dpr mutant and can be integrated into the chromosomal dpr locus. (ii) the cloned dpr, in turn, complements the ability of sgp to suppress the lethality of gpa.his. (iii) the dpr mutation suppresses the growth defect of gpa.his, and the dpr gpa.his strain shows a non cell type specific sterile phenotype. (iv) sgp is closely linked to the dpr locus. the dpr product has been shown to be responsible for processing and fatty acid acylation of a factor and ras proteins at their carboxyl termini. therefore, the sgp (dpr) product may be involved in membrane localization of an essential component in the mating factor signaling pathway.
