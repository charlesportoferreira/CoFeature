the sks protein kinase is a multicopy suppressor of the snf mutation of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying snf are defective in high affinity glucose transport, and thus are unable to grow fermentatively on media with low concentrations of glucose. a multicopy suppressor of the snf growth defect, sks (suppressor kinase of snf), was found to encode a putative ser/thr protein kinase homologous to ranp, a kinase that regulates the switch between meiosis and vegetative growth in schizosaccharomyces pombe. overexpression of the sks open reading frame is sufficient for suppression of the growth defects of snf mutants. disruption of the open reading frame eliminates this suppression; as does the mutation of the consensus atp binding site of sksp. a ddse (dna dependent snf suppressor element) was found to be present in the sks promoter region. the suppression by this ddse occurs in the absence of sks coding region, that is, the ddse can suppress a snf sks double null mutant which fails to grow fermentatively on low glucose as a snf mutant does. both sks and its ddse can additionally suppress the growth defects of grr mutants, which are also impaired in high affinity glucose transport. the snf genomic suppressors, rgt, rgt and ssn, are also capable of suppressing snf associated growth defects in a strain lacking sks.
