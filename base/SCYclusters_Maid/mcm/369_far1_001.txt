regulation of ste ubiquitination by ste phosphorylation and the skp cullin f box complex.. . ste is a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase that mediates pheromone signaling in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we showed previously that ste is ubiquitinated upon prolonged stimulation by pheromone and that accumulation of ubiquitinated ste results in enhanced transcription and cell division arrest responses (wang, y., and dohlman, h. g. () j. biol. chem. , ). we now report that ubiquitination of ste requires ste kinase and skp/cullin/f box (scf) ubiquitin conjugating activities. ste is not ubiquitinated in ste deficient cells or when the ste phosphorylation sites have been mutated. ste ubiquitination and degradation (but not phosphorylation) is specifically blocked in mutants defective for the e ubiquitin conjugating enzyme cdc or the cullin homologue cdc. both are components of the scf complex that ubiquitinates proteins during the g s transition of the cell cycle. our findings suggest that scf promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of ste, thereby favoring the resumption of cell division cycling after pheromone induced growth arrest.
