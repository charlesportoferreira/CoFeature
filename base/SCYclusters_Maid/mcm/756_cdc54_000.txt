identification of an mcm homologue expressed specifically in the sexual stage of plasmodium falciparum.. . mini chromosome maintenance (mcm) proteins play an essential role in dna replication initiation. we have isolated a novel gene encoding an mcm like protein from the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum using the vectorette technique. the gene has no introns and comprises an open reading frame encoding amino acid residues with a predicted mr of kda. the encoded protein, termed pfmcm, contains all conserved sequences in the mcm family and displays the highest homology to the cdc (mcm) of saccharomyces cerevisiae. however, pfmcm possesses five unique amino acid inserts with sizes ranging from seven to residues. southern blotting of genomic dna digests and chromosomal separations showed that the pfmcm gene is present as a single copy per haploid genome and is located on chromosome . a nucleotide transcript of this gene is expressed specifically in the sexual erythrocytic stage, indicating that pfmcm may be involved in gametogenesis in which dna is quickly replicated.
