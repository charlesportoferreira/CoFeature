the role of the carboxyterminal domain of rna polymerase ii in regulating origins of dna replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mcm (minichromosome maintenance) proteins function as a replication licensing factor (rlf m), which contributes to limiting initiation of dna replication to once per cell cycle. in the present study we show that a truncation of the pol ii ctd in a s. cerevisiae strain harboring a mutation in mcm partially reverses its ts phenotype and improves maintenance of cen/ars minichromosomes. we correlate this phenotype to effects on dna replication rather than to effects on transcription or specific gene expression. we also demonstrate that a similar truncation of the ctd reduces minichromosome stability and impairs stimulation of dna replication by trans activators and that tethering of recombinant pol ii ctd to an origin of replication has a significant stimulatory effect on minichromosome stability. furthermore, we show that pol ii is recruited to ars. we propose that in s. cerevisiae a mechanism of coordinating pol ii transcription and dna replication is mediated by the ctd of pol ii.
