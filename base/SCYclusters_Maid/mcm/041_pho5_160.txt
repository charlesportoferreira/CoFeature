one step gene replacement in yeast by cotransformation.. . a general method to replace chromosomal dna sequences of saccharomyces cerevisiae by any in vitro modified dna sequence has been developed and was applied to the pho locus on chromosome ii. a recipient strain was constructed in which part of the chromosomal pho sequence was substituted by the ura gene. replacement of this pho ura substitution by pho mutant alleles was achieved in one step by cotransformation with a pho dna fragment and the self replicating plasmid yep, which contains the leu gene as a selectable marker. leu+ transformants were selected, and the replacement events at the pho locus were detected by their ura phenotype ( % of the leu+ were ura ). in a similar way the pho coding sequence was replaced by the sequence coding for human tissue type plasminogen activator (t pa).
