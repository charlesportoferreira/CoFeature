receptor independent activators of heterotrimeric g protein signaling pathways.. . heterotrimeric g protein signaling systems are activated via cell surface receptors possessing the seven membrane span motif. several observations suggest the existence of other modes of stimulus input to heterotrimeric g proteins. as part of an overall effort to identify such proteins we developed a functional screen based upon the pheromone response pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we identified two mammalian proteins, ags and ags (activators of g protein signaling), that activated the pheromone response pathway at the level of heterotrimeric g proteins in the absence of a typical receptor. beta galactosidase reporter assays in yeast strains expressing different galpha subunits (gpa, g(s)alpha, g(i)alpha((gpa( ))), g(i)alpha((gpa( ))), galpha((gpa( )))) indicated that ags proteins selectively activated g protein heterotrimers. ags was only active in the g(i)alpha() and g(i)alpha() genetic backgrounds, whereas ags was active in each of the genetic backgrounds except gpa. in protein interaction studies, ags selectively associated with gbetagamma, whereas ags bound galpha and exhibited a preference for galphagdp versus galphagtpgammas. subsequent studies indicated that the mechanisms of g protein activation by ags and ags were distinct from that of a typical g protein coupled receptor. ags proteins provide unexpected mechanisms for input to heterotrimeric g protein signaling pathways. ags and ags may also serve as novel binding partners for galpha and gbetagamma that allow the subunits to subserve functions that do not require initial heterotrimer formation.
