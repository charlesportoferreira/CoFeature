biochemical and immunological characterization of the bovine leukemia virus (blv) envelope glycoprotein (gp) produced in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the nucleotide sequence coding for bovine leukemia virus (blv) envelope glycoprotein gp was inserted into a yeast escherichia coli shuttle vector carrying the promoter and secretion signal sequence of pho (the yeast gene coding for repressible acid phosphatase) and the cyc transcriptional terminator. yeast cells transformed by this construction synthesized gp after pho induction by inorganic phosphate deprivation. the yeast expressed gp was partially glycosylated into heterodisperse protein molecules ranging from to kda. no gp was excreted in the culture medium. the amount of protein accumulated in yeast cells was estimated to reach .% of soluble proteins. this modest level of expression seemed to be due to the toxicity of gp to the yeast cell. the yeast expressed gp products were used in enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of antibodies in sera from blv infected animals; they were also screened for the presence of well defined biological epitopes. in both studies poor reactivity was observed. rabbits immunized with the recombinant gp showed high antibody titers to native blv gp. however, these antibodies did not neutralize blv in vitro.
