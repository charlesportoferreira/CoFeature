multiple domains of fission yeast cdcp (mcm) are required for its association with the core mcm complex.. . the members of the mcm protein family are essential eukaryotic dna replication factors that form a six member protein complex. in this study, we use antibodies to four mcm proteins to investigate the structure of and requirements for the formation of fission yeast mcm complexes in vivo, with particular regard to cdcp (mcm). gel filtration analysis shows that the mcm protein complexes are unstable and can be broken down to subcomplexes. using coimmunoprecipitation, we find that misp (mcm) and cdcp (mcm) are tightly associated with one another in a core complex with which cdcp loosely associates. assembly of cdcp with the core depends upon cdcp. interestingly, there is no obvious change in cdcp containing mcm complexes through the cell cycle. using a panel of cdcp mutants, we find that multiple domains of cdcp are required for mcm binding. these studies indicate that mcm complexes in fission yeast have distinct substructures, which may be relevant for function.
