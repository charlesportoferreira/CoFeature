mcm/cdc bob bypasses the requirement for the s phase activator cdcp.. . cdcp is a protein kinase that is required for g/s transition and initiation of dna replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the mechanisms whereby cdcp and its substrates exerts their effects are unknown. we report here the characterization in s. cerevisiae of a recessive mutation in a member of the mcm family, mcm/cdc, which bypasses the requirement for cdcp and its interacting factor dbfp. because the mcm family of evolutionarily conserved proteins have been implicated in restricting dna replication to once per cell cycle, our studies suggest that cdcp is required late in g because in its absence the mcmp/cdcp blocks the initiation of dna replication. moreover, mcmp/cdcp may have both positive and negative effects on the ability of cell to initiate replication.
