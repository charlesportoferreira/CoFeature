characterization of caf and caf reveals a functional connection between the ccr not complex and a subset of srb proteins of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme.. . the ccr not transcriptional regulatory complex affects transcription both positively and negatively and consists of the following two complexes. a core x () dalton ( mda) complex consisting of ccr, caf, and the five not proteins and a larger, less defined . mda complex. we report here the identification of two new factors that associate with the ccr not proteins as follows. caf, a wd containing protein, and caf, a putative abc atpase. whereas neither caf nor caf was part of the core ccr not complex, both caf and caf appeared to be present in the . mda complex. caf also displayed physical interactions with multiple ccr not components and with dbf, a likely component of the . mda complex. in addition, both caf and caf were found to interact in a ccr dependent manner with srb, a component of the srb complex that is part of the yeast rna polymerase ii holoenzyme. the three related srb proteins, srb, srb, and srb, were found to interact with and to coimmunoprecipitate dbf, caf, ccr, not, and not. defects in srb and srb also affected processes at the adh locus known to be controlled by components of the ccr not complex; an srb mutation was shown to reduce adh derepression and either an srb or srb allele suppressed spt enhanced expression of adh. in addition, srb and srb alleles increased adr(c) dependent adh expression; not and not deletions are the only other known defects that elicit this phenotype. these results suggest a close physical and functional association between components of the ccr not complexes and the srb, , and components of the holoenzyme.
