mapping of the flo gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the flo gene has been assigned to chromosomes i and viii in saccharomyces cerevisiae. according to the results obtained, flocculation of strain stx id (reported as strain flo) is the result of two different genes. one of them is allelic to the previously reported flo and located at . cm from pho and cm from ade on chromosome i. the other was mapped on chromosome viii at . cm from pet and . cm from fur. this second gene generated a constitutive flocculation phenotype that was not under the control of the fsu suppressor. the latter has been reported to suppress certain flo genes.
