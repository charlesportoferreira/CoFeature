cooperative interaction of s. pombe proteins required for mating and morphogenesis.. . we isolated two s. pombe genes, scd and scd, that are required for normal morphology and mating. scd and scd are homologous to cdc and bem, respectively, of s. cerevisiae. epistasis analyses indicate that scd and ras converge upon scd, which, in turn, interacts with cdcsp, a rho like gtpase. studies with the yeast two hybrid system indicate that scd forms complexes with both scd and cdcsp. furthermore, biochemical studies indicate that the interaction between scd and scd is direct. the yeast two hybrid data further suggest that scd, scd, cdcsp, and ras, in its gtp bound state, act cooperatively to form a protein complex.
