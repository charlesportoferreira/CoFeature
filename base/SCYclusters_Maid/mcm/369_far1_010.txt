nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the cdcp exchange factor cdcp.. . cdcp, the gdp/gtp exchange factor for the regulator of actin cytoskeleton cdcp, localizes to sites of polarized growth. here we show that cdcp shuttles in and out of the yeast nucleus during vegetative growth. farp is necessary and sufficient for nuclear accumulation of cdcp, suggesting that its nuclear import occurs via an association with farp. nuclear export is triggered either by entry into the cell cycle or by mating pheromone. as farp is degraded upon entry into the cell cycle, cell cycle dependent export of cdcp occurs in the absence of farp, whereas during mating similar export kinetics indicate that a cdcp farp complex is exported. our results suggest that the nucleus serves as a store of preformed cdcp farp complex which is required for chemotropism.
