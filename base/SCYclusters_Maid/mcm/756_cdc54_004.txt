the origin recognition complex in silencing, cell cycle progression, and dna replication.. . this report describes the isolation of orc, the gene encoding the fifth largest subunit of the origin recognition complex, and the properties of mutants with a defective allele of orc. the orc mutation caused temperature sensitive growth and, at the restrictive temperature, caused cell cycle arrest. at the permissive temperature, the orc mutation caused an elevated plasmid loss rate that could be suppressed by additional tandem origins of dna replication. the sequence of orc revealed a potential atp binding site, making orcp a candidate for a subunit that mediates the atp dependent binding of orc to origins. genetic interactions among orc and orc and other cell cycle genes provided further evidence for a role for the origin recognition complex (orc) in dna replication. the silencing defect caused by orc strengthened previous connections between orc and silencing, and combined with the phenotypes caused by orc mutations, suggested that the complex itself functions in both processes.
