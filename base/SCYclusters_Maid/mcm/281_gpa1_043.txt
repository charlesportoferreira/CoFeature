msg, a novel protein phosphatase promotes adaptation to pheromone response in s. cerevisiae.. . pheromone stimulated yeast cells and haploid gpa deletion mutants arrest their cell cycle in g. overexpression of a novel gene called msg suppresses this inhibition of cell division. loss of msg function leads to a diminished adaptive response to pheromone. genetic analysis indicates that msg acts at a stage where the protein kinases ste and fus function to transmit the pheromone induced signal. since loss of msg function causes an increase in fus enzyme activity but not ste activity, we propose that msg impinges on the pathway at fus. sequence analysis suggests that msg encodes a protein tyrosine phosphatase. this is supported by the finding that recombinant msg has phosphatase activity in vitro and is able to inactivate autophosphorylated fus. thus msg might stimulate recovery from pheromone by regulating the phosphorylation state of fus.
