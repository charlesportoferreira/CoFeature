regulation of the yeast transcriptional factor pho activity by phosphorylation.. . the induction of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae gene pho expression is mediated by transcriptional factors pho and pho. pho protein has been reported to be phosphorylated and inactivated by a cyclin cdk (cyclin dependent kinase) complex, pho pho. we report here that pho can also be phosphorylated. a ser to ala mutation in the consensus sequence (spik) recognized by cdc/cdc related kinase in pho protein led to complete loss of its ability to activate the transcription of pho gene. further investigation showed that the pro to ser mutation inactivated pho protein as well, whereas the ser to asp mutation did not affect pho activity. since the pho asp mutant mimics ser phosphorylated pho, we postulate that only phosphorylated pho protein could activate the transcription of pho gene. two hybrid assays showed that yeast cdc could interact with pho. cdc immunoprecipitate derived from the yph strain grown under low phosphate conditions phosphorylated gst pho in vitro. a phosphate switch regulates the transcriptional activation activity of pho, and mutations of the (spik) site affect the transcriptional activation activity of pho and the interaction between pho and pho. biacore(r) analysis indicated that the negative charge in residue of pho was sufficient to help pho interact with pho in vitro.
