nuclear export of farp in response to pheromones requires the export receptor msnp/step.. . farp is a bifunctional protein that is required to arrest the cell cycle and to establish cell polarity during yeast mating. farp is localized predominantly in the nucleus but accumulates in the cytoplasm in cells exposed to pheromones. here we show that farp functions in both subcellular compartments. nuclear farp is required to arrest the cell cycle, whereas cytoplasmic farp is involved in the establishment of cell polarity. the subcellular localization of farp is regulated by two mechanisms. () farp contains a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal (nls), and () farp is exported from the nucleus by msnp/step, a member of the exportin family. cells deleted for msnp/step failed to export farp in response to pheromones, whereas overexpression of msnp/step was sufficient to accumulate farp in the cytoplasm in the absence of pheromones. msnp/step was localized in the nucleus and interacted with farp in a manner dependent on gtp bound gspp. two hybrid analysis identified a small fragment within farp that is necessary and sufficient for binding to msnp/step, and is also required to export farp in vivo. finally, similar to deltamsn/ste strains, cells expressing a mutant farp, which can no longer be exported, exhibit a mating defect, but are able to arrest their cell cycle in response to pheromones. taken together, our results suggest that nuclear export of farp by msnp/step coordinates the two separable functions of farp during mating.
