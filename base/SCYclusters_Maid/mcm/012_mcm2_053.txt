a kb ring chromosome shows an ars dependent increase in its mitotic stability in the mcm mutant of yeast.. . we have studied the effects of ars addition and deletion on the maintenance of a kb ring derivative of chromosome iii in a minichromosome maintenance mutant of yeast carrying the mcm mutation. when this ring chromosome, ciiir, had either of its two strong origins deleted, the resultant chromosome showed a much greater instability in the mutant as compared to that of the wild type strain. integration of more arss improved the maintenance of ciiir in the mutant but not in the wild type strain. increase in the size of ciiir, without any ars addition, did not improve the stability in either strain. a spontaneous revertant for improved growth at degrees c also co reverted for minichromosome and ciiir maintenance. the results suggest that ars malfunctioning leads to minichromosome and chromosome loss from mutant cells, affecting their growth at higher temperatures.
