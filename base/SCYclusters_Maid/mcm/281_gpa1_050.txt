mutagenesis of ste, a putative g gamma subunit in the saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone response pathway.. . the yeast ste gene product has sequence and functional similarity to the gamma subunits of g proteins. the cloned ste gene was subjected to a saturation mutagenesis using doped oligonucleotides. the populations of mutant genes were screened for two classes of ste mutations, those that allowed for increased mating of a strain containing a defective ste gene (compensators) and those that inhibited mating even in the presence of a functional ste gene (dominant negatives). three amino acid substitutions that enhanced mating in a specific ste (g beta) point mutant background were identified. these compensatory mutations were allele specific and had no detectable phenotype of their own; they may define residues that mediate an association between the g beta and g gamma subunits or in the association of the g beta gamma subunit with other components of the signalling pathway. several dominant negative mutations were also identified, including two c terminal truncations. these mutant proteins were unable to function in signal transduction by themselves, but they prevented signal transduction mediated by pheromone, as well as the constitutive signalling which is present in cells defective in the gpa (g alpha) gene. these mutant proteins may sequester g beta or some other component of the signalling machinery in a nonfunctional complex.
