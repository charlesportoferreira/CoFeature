cdcp is required for the cell cycle commitment point at start via degradation of the g cdk inhibitor farp.. . the budding yeast cdcp and its mammalian homologue p are involved in many important cellular activities. because previous cdc mutants have exclusive g/m arrest, cdcp was thought to play an essential role only during mitosis. we found that cdcp is required for the execution of start (a yeast cell cycle commitment point equivalent to the restriction point in mammalian cells) in both a normal mitotic cell cycle and cell cycle reentry after mating pheromone withdrawal through degradation of the g cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor farp. our work is the first to uncover novel roles of cdcp as a critical cell cycle regulator in g, and to shed new light on cell cycle regulation of farp, which is the first cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor shown to be a substrate of an essential proteolysis event mediated by cdcp.
