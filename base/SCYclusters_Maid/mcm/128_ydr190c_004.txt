the saccharomyces cerevisiae ruvb like protein, tihp, is required for cell cycle progression and rna polymerase ii directed transcription.. . two highly conserved ruvb like putative dna helicases, p/tipb and p/tipa, have been identified in the eukaryotes. here, we study the function of saccharomyces cerevisiae tih, which corresponds to mammalian p/tipb. tihp is required for vegetative cell growth and localizes in the nucleus. immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that tihp tightly interacts with tihp, the counterpart of mammalian p/tipa, which has been shown to interact with the tata binding protein and the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme complex. furthermore, the mutational study of the walker a motif, which is required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, showed that this motif plays indispensable roles in the function of tihp. when a temperature sensitive tih mutant, tih , was incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, cells were rapidly arrested in the g() phase. northern blot analysis revealed that tihp is required for transcription of g() cyclin and of several ribosomal protein genes. the similarities between the mutant phenotypes of tih and those of taf mutants suggest a role for tih in the regulation of rna polymerase ii directed transcription.
