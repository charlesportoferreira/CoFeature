ca+ signal is generated only once in the mating pheromone response pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the mating pheromone, alpha factor, of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae binds to the heterotrimeric g protein coupled cell surface receptor of mata cells and induces cellular responses necessary for mating. in higher eukaryotic cells, many hormones and growth factors rapidly mobilize a second messenger, ca+, by means of receptor g protein signaling. although striking similarities between the mechanisms of the receptor g protein signaling in yeast and higher eukaryotes have long been known, it is still uncertain whether the pheromone rapidly mobilizes ca+ necessary for early events of the pheromone response. here we reexamine this problem using sensitive methods for detecting ca+ fluxes and mobilization, and find no evidence that there is rapid ca+ influx leading to a rapid increase in the cytosolic free ca+ concentration. in addition, the yeast plc deletion mutant lacking phosphoinositide specific phospholipase c, a key enzyme for generating ca+ signals in higher eukaryotic cells, responds normally to the pheromone. these findings suggest that the receptor g protein signaling does not utilize ca+ as a second messenger in the early stage of the pheromone response pathway. since the receptor g protein signaling does stimulate ca+ influx after early events have finished and this stimulation is essential for late events in the pheromone response pathway [iida et al., () j. biol. chem., . ] ca+ may be used only once in the signal transduction pathway in unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast.
