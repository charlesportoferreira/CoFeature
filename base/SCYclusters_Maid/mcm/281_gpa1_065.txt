gpa, a haploid specific essential gene, encodes a yeast homolog of mammalian g protein which may be involved in mating factor signal transduction.. . gpa protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae is homologous to the alpha subunit of mammalian g protein. gpa transcript was found in haploid cells but was not detected in diploid cells. disruption of gpa resulted in a haploid specific lethal phenotype, indicating that gpa is a haploid specific essential gene for cell growth. upon regulation of expression of gpa by the galactose inducible gal promoter, the loss of gpa function was found to lead to cell cycle arrest at the late g phase. mutants that suppress the lethality of the gpa.his mutation showed a sterile phenotype that was not cell type specific. these results suggest that gpa protein may control the signal for mating factor mediated cell cycle arrest.
