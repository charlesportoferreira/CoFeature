characteristics of hepatitis b surface antigen produced in yeast.. . we have constructed an expression plasmid for regulated expression of the hepatitis b surface antigen gene in yeast using promoter of the yeast pho gene. in the yeast transformants, the monomeric hbsag (k dalton) was estimated to constitute approximately % of the total proteins. on extraction, the hbsag was found to have a buoyant density of . g/ml and an sw. value of . electron microscopy revealed particles of heterogeneous size ranging from nm. when the yeast hbsag was used to immunize guinea pigs, the anti hbsag antibodies produced could react with human serum hbsag.
