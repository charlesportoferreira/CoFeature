novel domains in nadph oxidase subunits, sorting nexins, and ptdins kinases. binding partners of sh domains?. . two sh domain containing cytosolic components of the nadph oxidase, pphox and pphox, are shown by analyses of their sequences to contain single copies of a novel class of domain, the px (phox) domain. homologous domains are demonstrated to be present in the cpk class of phosphatidylinositol kinase, s. cerevisiae bemp, and s. pombe scd, and a large family of human sorting nexin (snx) homologues. the majority of these domains contains a polyproline motif, typical of sh domain binding proteins. two further findings are reported. a third nadph oxidase subunit, pphox, is shown to contain four tetratricopeptide repeats (tprs) within its n terminal raclgtp binding region, and a residue motif in pphox is demonstrated to be present in protein kinase c isoforms iota/lambda and zeta, and in three zz domain containing proteins.
