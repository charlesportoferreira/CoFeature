c myc and the yeast transcription factor pho share a common cacgtg binding motif.. . the basic helix loop helix (b hlh) motif is common to a number of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and cell type determination. the b hlh motif is also present in the s. cerevisiae transcription factor pho which positively regulates the acid phosphatase gene pho. in this report we show that the b hlh region of pho is sufficient to confer specific dna binding to the sequence cacgtg and, by comparison of the basic regions of pho with those of other recently isolated cacgtg binding proteins, we identify a specific subset of conserved amino acids in the basic region likely to confer dna binding specificity. on the basis of these observations we predict successfully the effect of substituting the pho basic region with that from c myc and show that the chimaeric protein activates transcription from the cacgtg elements present in the pho uas. from these data it is clear that the myc basic region confers specific binding to the sequence cacgtg.
