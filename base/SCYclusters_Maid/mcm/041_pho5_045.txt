the phosphatase system in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has at least six species of acid and alkaline phosphatases with different cellular localizations, as well as inorganic phosphate (pi) transporters. most of the genes encoding these enzymes are coordinately repressed and derepressed depending on the pi concentration in the growth medium. the pi signals are conveyed to these genes through a regulatory circuit consisting of a set of positive and negative regulatory proteins. this phosphatase system is interested as one of the best systems for studying gene regulation in s. cerevisiae due to the simplicity of phenotype determination in genetic analysis. with this methodological advantage, considerable amounts of genetic and molecular evidence in phosphatase regulation have been accumulated in the past twenty five years. this article summarizes the current progress of research into this subject.
