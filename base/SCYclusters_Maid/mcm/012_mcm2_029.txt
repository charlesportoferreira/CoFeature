biochemical function of mouse minichromosome maintenance protein.. . minichromosome maintenance (mcm) proteins play an essential role in eukaryotic dna replication and bind to chromatin before the initiation of dna replication. we reported that mcm protein complexes consisting of mcm, , , and bind strongly to a histone sepharose column (ishimi, y., ichinose, s., omori, a., sato, k., and kimura, h. () j. biol. chem. , ). here, we have analyzed this interaction at the molecular level. we found that among six mouse mcm proteins, only mcm binds to histone; amino acid residues are responsible for this binding. the region required for nuclear localization of mcm was mapped near this histone binding domain. far western blotting analysis of truncated forms of h histone indicated that amino acid residues of h histone are required for binding to mcm. we have also shown that mouse mcm can inhibit the dna helicase activity of the human mcm, , and protein complex. these results suggest that mcm plays a different role in the initiation of dna replication than the other mcm proteins.
