identification of the yeast mcm related protein as a component of xenopus dna replication licensing factor.. . replication licensing factor is thought to be involved in the strict control of the initiation of dna replication in eukaryotes. we identified a kda protein as a candidate for the licensing factor in xenopus egg extracts. this protein was required for replication; it bound to sperm dna before the formation of nuclei and apparently dissociated from the nuclear dna during the progression of replication without being transported into the nuclei. an immunologically homologous protein in hela cells behaved similarly to the xenopus protein during the cell cycle. cloning and sequencing of the cdnas encoding the xenopus and human proteins revealed that they are homologs of yeast mcm, a putative yeast dna replication licensing factor.
