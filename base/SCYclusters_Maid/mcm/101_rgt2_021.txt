how do yeast cells sense glucose?. . a glucose sensing mechanism has been described in saccharomyces cerevisiae that regulates expression of glucose transporter genes. the sensor proteins snf and rgt are homologous to the transporters they regulate. snf and rgt are integral plasma membrane proteins with unique carboxy terminal domains that are predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm. in a recent paper ozcan and colleagues [ozcan s, et al. embo j ; . (ref. )] present evidence that the cytoplasmic domains of snf and rgt are required to transmit a glucose signal. they provide additional evidence to support their earlier assertion [ozcan s, et al. proc natl acad sci usa ;. (ref. )] that glucose transport via snf and rgt is not involved in glucose sensing but, rather, that these proteins behave like glucose receptors. other examples of transporter homologs with regulatory functions have recently been described in fungi as well [madi l, et al. genetics ; . (ref. ). and didion t, et al. mol microbiol ;. (ref. )]. the identification of this class of nutrient sensors is an important step in elucidating the complex of regulatory mechanisms that leads to adaptation of fungi to different environments.
