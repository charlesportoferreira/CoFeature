hsmcm. a new member of the human mcm/p family encodes a protein homologous to fission yeast mis.. . background. the tight regulatory mechanism that prevents more than one round of chromosomal dna replication per cell cycle is thought to require the function of mcm/p proteins. we report here the structural and functional analyses of hsmcm, a human homologue of the mis of schizosaccharomyces pombe. results. we demonstrate here that the transcription of the hsmcm gene was repressed in quiescent cells but was rapidly induced at the g/s phase by growth factor stimulation. the ' regulatory region of the hsmcm gene was found to harbour four putative ef binding motifs, and these were responsible for the promoter activity. the hsmcm protein level oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak at the g/s phase. we also showed that the cell cycle dependent change of subcellular localization of hsmcm resembles those of other mcm/p proteins. hsmcm consists of two forms, a form extractable by nonidet p and the nucleus bound form. a demonstration of the association of hsmcm with hsmcm and hsmcm in vivo supports the idea that they behave as a heteromeric complex. we mapped the hsmcm gene at q . conclusion. the results indicate that the behaviour of hsmcm is reminiscent of replication licensing factor like other mcm/p family members.
