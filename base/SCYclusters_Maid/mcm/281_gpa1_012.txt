par thrombin receptor g protein interactions. separation of binding and coupling determinants in the galpha subunit.. . signal transfer between the protease activated par thrombin receptor and membrane associated heterotrimeric g proteins is mediated by protein protein interactions. we constructed a yeast signaling system that resolves domain specific functions of binding from coupling in the galpha subunit. the endogenous yeast galpha subunit, gpa, does not bind to par and served as a null structural template. n and c terminal portions of mammalian g(i) and g() were substituted back into the gpa template and gain of function assessed. the c terminal third of g(), but not of g(i), provides sufficient interactions for coupling to occur with par. the n terminal two thirds of g(i) also contains sufficient determinants to bind and couple to par and overcome the otherwise negative or missing interactions supplied by the c terminal third of gpa. replacement of the n terminal alpha helix of g(i), residues , with those of gpa abolishes coupling but not binding to par or to betagamma subunits. these data support a model that the n terminal alphan helix of the galpha subunit is physically interposed between par and the gbeta subunit and directly assists in transferring the signal between agonist activated receptor and g protein.
