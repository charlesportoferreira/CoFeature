the association and involvement of some members of the p protein family in a cell free dna replication of xenopus eggs.. . two types of antibodies were prepared one directed against an oligopeptide specific to pcdc, a mammalian homologue of yeast cdc, and the other against an oligopeptide highly conserved in the p protein family. immunoprecipitation with anti pcdc antibody revealed that some members of the p protein family were coprecipitated with pcdc in the soluble fraction of xenopus s phase extracts. immunoblot analysis showed that all of the coprecipitated proteins reacted with the antibody against an oligopeptide, designated as a dead box motif, a highly conserved sequence in the p protein family. the immunodepleted extracts with anti pcdc antibody bound beads showed much lower activity of dna replication than the mock treated extracts. recovery of replication was achieved by supplementing depleted extracts with the proteins eluted from anti pcdc antibody bound beads. these findings suggest that the proteins contained in the p protein family were associated in the extracts and that the multiprotein complex of the family plays an essential role in a cell free dna replication of xenopus eggs.
