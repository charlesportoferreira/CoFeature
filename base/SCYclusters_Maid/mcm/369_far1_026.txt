cloning of the ste gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae as a suppressor of the mating defect of cdc temperature sensitive mutants.. . the ste gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned using a screening procedure designed to isolate genes of the s. cerevisiae pheromone response pathway. we screened a yeast genomic high copy number plasmid library for genes that allow mating of cdcts mutants at the restrictive temperature without affecting the cell cycle arrest phenotype. one of the genes cloned was identified by genetic analysis as ste. ste encodes a predicted open reading frame of amino acids and exhibits significant homology to far protein. rna blot analysis reveals that ste gene transcription is regulated by the mating type of the cell and depends on an intact pheromone response pathway.
