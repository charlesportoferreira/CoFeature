characterization of two new genes down regulated by alpha factor.. . to detect genes directly down regulated by alpha factor, , plaque forming units of a saccharomyces cerevisiae lambda gt gene bank were differentially screened with cdna of cells treated with alpha factor for min. two new genes were detected in this way, called alpha. and alpha.. the former is transiently down regulated by alpha factor; it is very highly transcribed in late exponential phase cells. the gene, located on the right arm of chromosome xiii, codes for a amino acid protein with a signal peptide. the protein has been shown with an antibody to be present in the membrane fraction. the gene has also been cloned as hor (hyperosmolarity responsive protein; hirayama et al., ). no other homologous sequences have been detected in the yeast genome. alpha., located on the right arm of chromosome xii, corresponds to the open reading frame ylrc; it codes for a amino acid protein containing a signal peptide. its derived amino acid sequence is homologous to the n terminal half of the sed gene product. sed, when overexpressed, is able to suppress a defect in the hdel receptor coded for by the erd gene (hardwick and pelham, ); however, alpha. is not able to do so. the disruption of alpha. or alpha. does not lead to a special phenotype.
