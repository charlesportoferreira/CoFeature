pho is associated with the rpd histone deacetylase and is required for its normal function in regulation of gene expression and silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the rpd histone deacetylase (hdac) functions in a large complex containing many proteins including sin and sap. previous evidence indicates that the pho, rpd, sin, and sap mutants exhibit similar defects in pho regulation. we report that pho mutants like rpd, sin, and sap are hypersensitive to cycloheximide and heat shock and exhibit enhanced silencing of rdna, telomeric, and hmr loci, suggesting that these genes are functionally related. based on these observations, we explored whether pho is a component of the rpd hdac complex. our results demonstrate that myc pho co immunoprecipitates with ha rpd and ha sap. furthermore, similar levels of hdac activity were detected in immunoprecipitates of ha pho, ha rpd, or ha sap. in contrast, hdac activity was not detected in immunoprecipitates of ha pho or ha sap from strains lacking rpd, suggesting that rpd is the hdac associated with these proteins. however, hdac activity was detected in immunoprecipitates of ha sap or ha rpd from cells lacking pho, although levels were significantly lower than those detected in wild type cells, indicating that rpd activity is compromised in the absence of pho. together, our genetic and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that pho is a component of the rpd hdac complex, and is required for the normal function of this complex.
