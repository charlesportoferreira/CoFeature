molecular cloning of the dac/fus gene essential for pheromone induced g arrest of the cell cycle in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mating pheromones, known as a and alpha factors, arrest the division of cells of opposite mating types, alpha and a respectively, in saccharomyces cerevisiae. i have cloned the dac gene, which is required for both pheromone induced division arrest and cell fusion during conjugation. the constructed dac.leu null mutation leads to defects in both pheromone induced division arrest and cell fusion during conjugation; it also suppresses the growth defect caused by the gpa mutation (a mutation in the alpha subunit of the s. cerevisiae g protein). these results indicate that dac may be the same gene as fus, which was recently isolated by elion et al. () as a gene essential for cell fusion during conjugation. the dac.leu null mutant also showed morphological alterations in response to mating pheromones. i show here that the dac product plays an essential role in both the division arrest signalling pathway of the yeast pheromone response and in cell fusion during conjugation.
