signaling and circuitry of multiple mapk pathways revealed by a matrix of global gene expression profiles.. . genome wide transcript profiling was used to monitor signal transduction during yeast pheromone response. genetic manipulations allowed analysis of changes in gene expression underlying pheromone signaling, cell cycle control, and polarized morphogenesis. a two dimensional hierarchical clustered matrix, covering of the most highly regulated genes, was constructed from diverse experimental conditions. diagnostic subsets of coexpressed genes reflected signaling activity, cross talk, and overlap of multiple mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) pathways. analysis of the profiles specified by two different mapks fusp and kssp revealed functional overlap of the filamentous growth and mating responses. global transcript analysis reflects biological responses associated with the activation and perturbation of signal transduction pathways.
