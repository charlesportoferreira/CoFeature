bm, a human member of the mcm family, is displaced from chromatin during dna replication.. . we have recently cloned and characterized a human member (bm) of the mcm family of putative relication factors (todorov, i.t., r. pepperkok, r.n. philipova, s. kearsey, w. ansorge, and d. werner. . j. cell sci. . ). while this protein is located in the nucleus throughout interphase, we report here a dramatic alteration in its nuclear binding during the cell cycle. bm is retained in the nucleus after triton x extraction in g and early s phase cells, but is progressively lost as s phase proceeds, and little bm is retained in detergent extracted g nuclei. bm that is resistant to extraction in g nuclei is removed by dnase i digestion, suggesting that the protein is chromatin associated. in addition, we present evidence for variations in the electrophoretic mobility of bm that may reflect posttranslational modifications of bm during the cell cycle. during mitosis, bm is present as a fast migrating form, but on entry into g, the protein is converted into a slow migrating form. with the onset of s phase, the slow migrating form is progressively converted into the fast form. bm is phosphorylated at all stages of the cell cycle, but during interphase the fast form is hyperphosphorylated compared with the slow form. these apparent changes in modification may reflect or effect changes in the nuclear binding of bm. the behavior of bm is not dissimilar to related proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae, such as mcmp, which are excluded from the nucleus after dna replication. we speculate that bm may be involved in the control that limits eukaryotic dna replication to one round per cell cycle.
