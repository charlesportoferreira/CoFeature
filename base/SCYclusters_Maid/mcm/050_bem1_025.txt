yeast src homology region domain binding proteins involved in bud formation.. . the yeast protein bemp, which bears two src homology region (sh) domains, is involved in cell polarization. a rho type gtpase, rhop, is involved in the maintenance of cell polarity for bud formation, and the rho defect is suppressed by a high dose of bem. mutational analysis revealed that the second sh domain from the nh terminus (sh ) of bemp is important for the functions of bemp in bud formation and in the suppression of the rho defect. boip, which bound to sh bemp, was identified using the two hybrid system. boip has a proline rich sequence that is critical for displaying the boip bemp two hybrid interaction, an sh domain in its nh terminal half, and a pleckstrin homology domain in its cooh terminal half. a boi homologue, boi, was identified as a gene whose overexpression inhibited cell growth. cells overexpressing either boi or boi were arrested as large, round, and unbudded cells, indicating that the boi proteins affect cell polarization. genetic analysis revealed that boi and boi are functionally redundant and important for cell growth. delta boi delta boi cells became large round cells or lysed with buds, displaying defects in bud formation and in the maintenance of cell polarity. analysis using several truncated versions of boi revealed that the cooh terminal half, which contains the pleckstrin homology domain is essential for the function of boip in cell growth, while the nh terminal half is not, and the nh terminal half might be required for modulating the function of bemp. overproduction of either rhop or the rhop related gtpase rhop suppressed the boi defect. these results demonstrate that rhop gtpases and boi proteins function in the maintenance of cell polarity for bud formation.
