regulation of membrane and subunit interactions by n myristoylation of a g protein alpha subunit in yeast.. . initiation of the mating process in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the action of secreted pheromones and g protein coupled receptors. as in other eukaryotes, the yeast g protein alpha subunit undergoes n myristoylation (gpa gene product, gpap). this modification appears to be essential for function, since a myristoylation site mutation exhibits the null phenotype in vivo (gpa(ga)). here we examine how myristoylation affects gpap activity in vitro. we show that the ga mutant of gpap, when fused with glutathione s transferase, can still form a complex with the g protein betagamma subunits. the complex is stabilized by gdp and is dissociated upon treatment with guanosine ' o (thiotriphosphate). in addition, there is no apparent difference in the relative binding affinity of gbetagamma for mutant and wild type gpap. using sucrose density gradient fractionation of cell membranes, gpap associates normally with the plasma membrane whereas gpapga is mislocalized to a microsomal membrane fraction. a portion of gbetagamma is also mislocalized in these cells, as it is in a gpadelta strain. in contrast, wild type gpap reaches the plasma membrane in cells that do not express gbetagamma or cell surface receptors. these findings indicate that mislocalization of gpapga is not caused by a redistribution of gbetagamma, nor is it the result of any difference in gbetagamma binding affinity. these data suggest that myristoylation is required for specific targeting of gpap to the plasma membrane, where it is needed to interact with the receptor and to regulate the release of gbetagamma.
