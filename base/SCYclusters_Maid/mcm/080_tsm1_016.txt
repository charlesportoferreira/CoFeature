yeast taf(ii) is required for cell cycle progression through g/m but not for general transcription activation.. . the rna polymerase ii general transcription factor tfiid is a multisubunit complex comprising tata box binding protein and associated factors (tafiis). in vitro experiments have suggested that tafiis are essential coactivators required for rna polymerase ii directed transcription activation. here, for the first time, we analyze systematically the in vivo function of a specific tafii, yeast tafii (ytafii). we show that functional inactivation of ytafii by temperature sensitive mutations or depletion leads to arrest at the g/m phase of the cell cycle. unexpectedly, in the absence of functional ytafii, a variety of endogenous yeast genes were all transcribed normally, including those driven by well characterized activators. taken together, our results indicate that ytafii is not required for transcription activation in general, and reveal linkages between taf function and cell cycle progression.
