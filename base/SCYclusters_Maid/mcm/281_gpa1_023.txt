mapping of a yeast g protein betagamma signaling interaction.. . the mating pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used as a model system for g protein coupled receptor mediated signal transduction. following receptor activation by the binding of mating pheromones, g protein betagamma subunits transmit the signal to a map kinase cascade, which involves interaction of gbeta (step) with the map kinase scaffold protein step. here, we identify residues in step required for the interaction with step. these residues define a new signaling interface close to the step binding site within the gbetagamma coiled coil. step mutants defective in the step interaction interact efficiently with gpap (galpha) and step (ggamma) but cannot function in signal transduction because cells expressing these mutants are sterile. ste ls is temperature sensitive for its interaction with step, and also for signaling. we have identified a step mutant (la) that displays a synthetic interaction defect with ste ls, providing strong evidence that step and step interact directly in vivo through an interface that involves hydrophobic residues. the correlation between disruption of the step step interaction and sterility confirms the importance of this interaction in signal transduction. identification of the gbetagamma coiled coil in step binding may set a precedent for gbetagamma effector interactions in more complex organisms.
