characterisation of a human homologue of a yeast cell division cycle gene, mcm, located adjacent to the ' end of the lactase gene on chromosome q.. . four exons of a human homologue of a yeast cell division cycle gene (mcm/mis, which is thought to encode a dna replication licensing factor) have been identified . kb upstream from the start of transcription of the intestinal lactase gene on human chromosome q, initially by similarity to a rat 'intestinal crypt cell replication factor'. rt pcr analysis shows, that unlike lactase, mcm is not restricted in its tissue distribution and does not show person to person variation in the level of expression in adult intestine.
