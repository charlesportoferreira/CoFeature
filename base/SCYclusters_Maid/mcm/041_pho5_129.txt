studies on the structure, expression and function of the yeast regulatory gene pho.. . the yeast regulatory gene pho encodes a protein assumed to activate, in concert with the pho protein, the transcription of the repressible acid phosphatase coding gene pho. the pho gene was cloned and sequenced. northern blot analysis revealed a low and pi independent transcription level. we stress the presence of two potential dna binding structures, one of them as part of a homeodomain similar sequence, in the deduced pho protein. our data indicate that quite a large portion of the c terminal end of the pho activator is dispensable for derepression of pho. disruption analysis suggests the presence of a nuclear address signal in the n terminal region. we show that the pho function in the regulation of phosphate metabolism can be partially fulfilled by overproduced pho. inability of pho mutants to sporulate indicates a possible involvement of pho products in the regulation of genes related to the life cycle.
