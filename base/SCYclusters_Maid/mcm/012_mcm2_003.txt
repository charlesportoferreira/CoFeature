the cdc (mcm) protein is required for the phosphorylation of minichromosome maintenance complex by the dfp hsk kinase.. . previous studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae have defined an essential role for the dbf cdc kinase complex in the initiation of dna replication presumably by phosphorylation of target proteins, such as the minichromosome maintenance (mcm) complex. we have examined the phosphorylation of the mcm complex by the dfp hsk kinase, the schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of dbf cdc. in vitro, the purified dfp hsk kinase efficiently phosphorylated mcmp. in contrast, mcmp, present in the six subunit mcm complex, was a poor substrate of this kinase and required cdcp (homologue of mcmp) for efficient phosphorylation. in the presence of cdcp, dfp hsk phosphorylated the mcmp and mcmp subunits of the mcm complex. cdcp interacted with both the mcm complex and dfp hsk by selectively binding to the mcm subunits and dfpp, respectively. the n terminus of cdcp was found to interact directly with dfp hsk and was essential for phosphorylation of the mcm complex. truncated derivatives of cdcp that complemented the temperature sensitive phenotype of cdc mutant cells also stimulated the phosphorylation of mcm complex, implying that this activity might be a critical role of cdcp in vivo. these results suggest that cdcp participates in the activation of prereplicative complex by recruiting the dfp hsk kinase and stimulating the phosphorylation of the mcm complex.
