negative regulation of far at the start of the yeast cell cycle.. . in budding yeast, a switch between the mutually exclusive pathways of cell cycle progression and conjugation is controlled at start in late g phase. mating pheromones promote conjugation by arresting cells in g phase before start. pheromone induced cell cycle arrest requires a functional far gene. we have found that far transcription and protein accumulation are regulated independently during the cell cycle. far rna and protein are highly expressed in early g, but decline sharply at start. far is phosphorylated just before it disappears at start, suggesting that modification may target far for degradation. although far mrna levels rise again during late s or g phase, reaccumulation of far protein to functional levels is restricted until after nuclear division.
