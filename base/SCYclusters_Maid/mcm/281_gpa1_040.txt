site directed mutations altering the caax box of ste, the yeast pheromone response pathway g gamma subunit.. . the ste gene encodes the gamma subunit of the g protein which functions in the saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone response pathway. the ste gene product undergoes a post translational processing at the carboxyl terminus directed by the ccaax box motif cctlm. a variety of site directed mutations of this sequence have been constructed to test the role of this motif on ste function. mutations which change or eliminate the cysteine at position abolish ste dependent mating, and thus the cysteine (c) is essential for ste function. however, inactivation of the prenyltransferase by disruption of dpr has only a minor effect on ste dependent mating. mutation of cysteine to serine significantly reduces but does not eliminate ste function. deletion of the c terminal tlm sequence or modification of the ultimate methionine to lysine, arginine or leucine, all changes which do not affect the caax box cysteines, have only minor effects on ste dependent mating. intriguingly, these latter mutations dramatically compromise ste function in cells which are deleted for gpa, the alpha subunit of the g protein. in addition, overexpression of these mutant versions of ste causes a dominant negative phenotype and inhibits the constitutive mating response generated by gpa deletion in cells which contain a functional ste gene. these results suggest that the c terminus of ste and the gpa protein have overlapping roles in some aspect of yeast g protein function such as membrane targeting.
