tipb, a new ruvb like dna helicase, is included in a complex together with another ruvb like dna helicase, tipa.. . we previously reported that tipa is a novel mammalian dna helicase showing structural similarity with the bacterial recombination factor ruvb. in this study, we isolated a new tipa related gene, termed tipb, from human and yeast cells. tipb also resembled ruvb, thus suggesting that tipa and tipb are included in a gene family. like tipa, tipb was abundantly expressed in the testis and thymus. enzyme assays revealed that tipb was an single stranded dna stimulated atpase and atp dependent dna helicase. most of the enzymatic properties of tipb were the same as those of tipa, whereas the polarity of tipb dna helicase activity (' to ') was the opposite to that of tipa. tipb and tipa bound to each other and were included in the same complex of approximately kda in a cell. we found that tipb was an essential gene for the growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae, as is the tipa gene, suggesting that tipb does not complement the tipa function and vice versa. from these observations, we suggest that tipb plays an essential role in the cellular processes involved in dna metabolism.
