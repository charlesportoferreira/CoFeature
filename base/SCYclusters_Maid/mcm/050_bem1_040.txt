interactions between the bud emergence proteins bemp and bemp and rho type gtpases in yeast.. . the sh domain containing protein bemp is needed for normal bud emergence and mating projection formation, two processes that require asymmetric reorganizations of the cortical cytoskeleton in saccharomyces cerevisiae. to identify proteins that functionally and/or physically interact with bemp, we screened for mutations that display synthetic lethality with a mutant allele of the bem gene and for genes whose products display two hybrid interactions with the bem protein. cdc, which is required for bud emergence and encodes a gef (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) for the essential rho type gtpase cdcp, was identified during both screens. the cooh terminal amino acids of cdcp, outside of the gef domain, can interact with a portion of bemp that lacks both sh domains. bacterially expressed cdcp and bemp bind to each other in vitro, indicating that no other yeast proteins are required for this interaction. the most frequently identified gene that arose from the bem synthetic lethal screen was the bud emergence gene bem (bender and pringle. . mol. cell biol. . ), which is allelic with ipl (increase in ploidy; chan and botstein, . genetics. . ). here we show that bemp contains a gap (gtpase activating protein) domain for rho type gtpases, and that this portion of bemp can stimulate in vitro the gtpase activity of rhop, a second essential yeast rho type gtpase. cells deleted for bem become large and multinucleate. these and other genetic, two hybrid, biochemical, and phenotypic data suggest that multiple rho type gtpases control the reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton in yeast and that the functions of these gtpases are tightly coupled. also, these findings raise the possibility that bemp may regulate or be a target of action of one or more of these gtpases.
