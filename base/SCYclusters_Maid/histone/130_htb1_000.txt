a sequence element downstream of the yeast htb gene contributes to mrna ' processing and cell cycle regulation.. . histone mrnas accumulate in the s phase and are rapidly degraded as cells progress into the g() phase of the cell cycle. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, fusion of the ' untranslated region and downstream sequences of the yeast histone gene htb to a neomycin phosphotransferase open reading frame is sufficient to confer cell cycle regulation on the resulting chimera gene (neo htb). we have identified a sequence element, designated the distal downstream element (dde), that influences both the ' end cleavage site selection and the cell cycle regulation of the neo htb mrna. mutations in the dde, which is located approximately nucleotides downstream of the htb gene, lead to a delay in the accumulation of the neo htb mrna in the s phase and a lack of mrna turnover in the g() phase. the dde is transcribed as part of the primary transcript and binds a protein factor(s). maximum binding is observed in the s phase of the cell cycle, and mutations that affect the turnover of the htb mrna alter the binding activity. while located in the same general region, mutations that affect ' end cleavage site selection act independently from those that alter the cell cycle regulation.
