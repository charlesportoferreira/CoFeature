sir functions are required for the toleration of an unrepaired double strand break in a dispensable yeast chromosome.. . unrepaired dna double strand breaks (dsbs) typically result in g() arrest. cell cycle progression can resume following repair of the dsbs or through adaptation to the checkpoint, even if the damage remains unrepaired. we developed a screen for factors in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae that affect checkpoint control and/or viability in response to a single, unrepairable dsb that is induced by ho endonuclease in a dispensable yeast artificial chromosome containing human dna. sir, , or mutants exhibit a prolonged, rad dependent g() arrest in response to the unrepairable dsb followed by a slow adaptation to the persistent break, leading to division and rearrest in the next g(). there are a small number of additional cycles before permanent arrest as microcolonies. thus, sir genes, which repress silent mating type gene expression, are required for the adaptation and the prevention of indirect lethality resulting from an unrepairable dsb in nonessential dna. rapid adaptation to the g() checkpoint and high viability were restored in sir( ) strains containing additional deletions of the silent mating type loci hml and hmr, suggesting that genes under mating type control can reduce the toleration of a single dsb. however, coexpression of mata and matalpha in sir(+) haploid cells did not lead to lethality from the ho induced dsb, suggesting that toleration of an unrepaired dsb requires more than one sir(+) function.
