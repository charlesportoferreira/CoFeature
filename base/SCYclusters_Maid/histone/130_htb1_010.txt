coding and noncoding sequences at the ' end of yeast histone hb mrna confer cell cycle regulation.. . yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) histone mrna synthesis is tightly regulated to the s phase of the cell division cycle as a result of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. we focused on the role of posttranscriptional control in histone hb gene (htb) regulation and studied a portion of the htb message required for cell cycle specific accumulation. the ' end of the htb gene containing a amino acid coding sequence and entire noncoding sequence was fused to the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase ii gene (neo) under control of the gal promoter. the expression of the endogenous and chimeric htb genes was analyzed during the yeast cell cycle. as yeast cells entered a synchronous cell cycle following release from alpha factor arrest, the level of gal promoter controlled neo htb message increased approximately fold during s phase and dropped to basal level when the cells left s phase. this indicates that the ' end of the htb mrna is capable of conferring cycle specific regulation on a heterologous message. deletion analysis of the ' end showed that the signal for cell cycle control of htb mrna includes contiguous coding and noncoding sequences surrounding the stop codon. this differs from the situation in mammalian cells, whose posttranscriptional regulation of histone genes is mediated through a short sequence containing a stem loop structure near the very terminus of the untranslated ' end.
