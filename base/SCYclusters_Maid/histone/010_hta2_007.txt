a conserved sequence in histone ha which is a ubiquitination site in higher eucaryotes is not required for growth in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . histones ha and hb are modified by ubiquitination of specific lysine residues in higher and lower eucaryotes. to identify functions of ubiquitinated histone ha, we studied an organism in which genetic analysis of histones is feasible, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. surprisingly, immunoblotting experiments using both anti ubiquitin and anti ha antibodies gave no evidence that s. cerevisiae contains ubiquitinated histone ha. the immunoblot detected a variety of other ubiquitinated species. a sequence of five residues in s. cerevisiae histone ha that is identical to the site of ha ubiquitination in higher eucaryotes was mutated to substitute arginines for lysines. any ubiquitination at this site would be prevented by these mutations. yeast organisms carrying this mutation were indistinguishable from the wild type under a variety of conditions. thus, despite the existence in s. cerevisiae of several gene products, such as rad and cdc, which are capable of ubiquitinating histone ha in vitro, ubiquitinated histone ha is either scarce in or absent from s. cerevisiae. furthermore, the histone ha sequence which serves as a ubiquitination site in higher eucaryotes is not essential for yeast growth, sporulation, or resistance to either heat stress or uv radiation.
