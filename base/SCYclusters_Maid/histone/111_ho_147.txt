in vitro regulation of a sin dependent dna binding activity by stimulatory and inhibitory factors.. . the yeast sin gene (also known as sdii, is a known negative regulator of the yeast ho gene. a dna binding activity, called sdp, which binds to the ho promoter, is absent in extracts prepared from sin mutants and has been proposed to function as a repressor. we show that sin does not encode sdp and that sdp dna binding activity is modulated in vitro by two factors, an inhibitory factor, i sdp, and a stimulatory factor, s sdp. i sdp acts as an in vitro inhibitor of the sdp dna binding activity. restoration of the dna binding activity is achieved by inclusion of a stimulatory factor, s sdp, which copurifies with the sin protein. sdp dna binding activity was restored by treating a protein fraction containing sdp and i sdp with the dissociating agent formamide.
