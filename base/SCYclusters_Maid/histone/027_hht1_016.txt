cloning and analysis of the kluyveromyces lactis trp gene. a chromosomal locus flanked by genes encoding inorganic pyrophosphatase and histone h.. . the trp gene of the yeast kluyveromyces lactis has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae trp mutation. the gene was located within the clone by transposon mutagenesis and the coding region identified by dna sequencing. this has indicated that k. lactis trp encodes a amino acid polypeptide which shows % identity to the homologous s. cerevisiae protein. the k. lactis trp gene has been disrupted by substituting the s. cerevisiae ura gene for a large part of the trp coding sequence. replacement of the chromosomal trp locus with this construction has enabled the production of non reverting trp strains of k. lactis, while a genetic analysis of the disrupted allele confirmed that the trp gene had been cloned. dna sequencing has also shown that the k. lactis trp sequence is flanked by genes encoding inorganic pyrophosphatase and histone h, which we have designated ipp and hht respectively. hybridization studies have shown that in common with s. cerevisiae, k. lactis has two copies of the histone h gene. each h gene is closely linked to a gene encoding histone h and in both yeast species the ipp gene is tightly linked to one of the histone gene pairs.
