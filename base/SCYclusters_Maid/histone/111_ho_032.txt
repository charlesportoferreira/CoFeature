functional analysis of ho gene in delayed homothallism in saccharomyces cerevisiae wy.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae wy exhibits a novel life cycle, with delayed homothallism caused by a defective ho gene. in this strain, gradual diploidization occurs during successive subcultures. three amino acids of wy ho were different from those of wild type (wt) ho, which included a nonsense mutation (tag) from trp and two amino acid changes of his to leu and glu to lys. the ho gene of heterothallic strain cg was also sequenced in this study. four amino acids of ho were different from those of ho. among different amino acids in wy ho and ho, the alteration of his to leu was common between them. his in ho was previously suggested to be involved in the dna binding. we constructed a variety of chimeric ho genes by exchanging the corresponding restriction fragments generated from the wt ho, wy ho and ho genes. these results and the site directed mutagenesis studies allowed us to draw the following conclusions. (a) gly is essential for ho activity; (b) mutation of his to leu significantly reduces the ho activity; (c) amber mutation (tag) in wy ho car be suppressed inefficiently.
