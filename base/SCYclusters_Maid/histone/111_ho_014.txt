the rec gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. isolation and genetic analysis.. . recombination deficient strains have been proven useful for the understanding of the genetic control of homologous recombination. as the genetic screens used to isolate recombination deficient (rec( )) yeast mutants have not been saturated, we sought to develop a simple colony color assay to identify mutants with low or elevated rates of recombination. using this system we isolated a collection of rec( ) mutants. we report the characterization of the rec gene identified in this way. rec is required for normal levels of interplasmid recombination and gamma ray induced mitotic interchromosomal recombination. the rec mutant failed to grow at degrees c. microscopic analysis of plated cells showed that % of them did not form visible colonies at permissive temperature. haploid cells of the rec mutant show the same gamma ray sensitivity as wild type ones. however, the diploid rec mutant shows gamma ray sensitivity which is comparable with heterozygous rec/rec diploid cells. this fact indicates semidominance of the rec mutation. diploid strains homozygous for the rec rad mutations had the same gamma ray sensitivity as single rad diploids and exhibited dramatically decreased growth rate. the expression of the ho gene does not lead to inviability of rec cells. the rec mutation has an effect on meiosis, likely meiotic recombination, even in the heterozygous state. we cloned the rec gene. sequence analysis revealed that the rec gene is encoded by orf ydrw. earlier, this orf was attributed to mnn, bed, slc, cax genes. two multicopy plasmids with suppressers of the rec mutation (pm and pm) were isolated. the deletion analysis showed that only dna fragments with the cdc and hac genes can partially complement the rec mutation.
