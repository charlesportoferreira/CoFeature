rad dependent ubiquitination of histone hb in yeast.. . although ubiquitinated histones are present in substantial levels in vertebrate cells, the roles they play in specific biological processes and the cellular factors that regulate this modification are not well characterized. ubiquitinated hb (uhb) has been identified in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, and mutation of the conserved ubiquitination site is shown to confer defects in mitotic cell growth and meiosis. uhb was not detected in rad mutants, which are defective for the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubc, thus identifying rad as the major cellular activity that ubiquitinates hb in yeast.
