the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad checkpoint reduces the dna damage associated stimulation of directed translocations.. . genetic instability in the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad mutant correlates with failure to arrest the cell cycle in response to dna damage. we quantitated the dna damage associated stimulation of directed translocations in rad+ and rad mutants. directed translocations were generated by selecting for his+ prototrophs that result from homologous, mitotic recombination between two truncated his genes, gal.his delta' and trp.his delta'.hocs. compared to rad+ strains, the rad mutant exhibits a fold higher rate of spontaneous, mitotic recombination and a greater than fold increase in the number of uv and x ray stimulated his+ recombinants that contain translocations. the higher level of recombination in rad mutants correlated with the appearance of nonreciprocal translocations and additional karyotypic changes, indicating that genomic instability also occurred among non his sequences. both enhanced spontaneous recombination and dna damage associated recombination are dependent on rad, a gene involved in dna excision repair. the hyperrecombinational phenotype of the rad mutant was correlated with a deficiency in cell cycle arrest at the g m checkpoint by demonstrating that if rad mutants were arrested in g before irradiation, the numbers both of uv and gamma ray stimulated recombinants were reduced. the importance of g arrest in dna damage induced sister chromatid exchange (sce) was evident by a fold reduction in ho endonuclease induced sce and no detectable x ray stimulation of sce in a rad mutant. we suggest that one mechanism by which the rad mediated g m checkpoint may reduce the frequency of dna damage induced translocations is by channeling the repair of double strand breaks into sce.
