mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc gene affect double strand break induced intrachromosomal recombination.. . to isolate saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants defective in recombinational dna repair, we constructed a strain that contains duplicated ura alleles that flank leu and ade genes at the ura locus on chromosome v. when a ho endonuclease cleavage site is located within one of the ura alleles, ura+ recombination is increased over fold in wild type strains following ho induction from the gal, promoter. this strain was used to screen for mutants that exhibited reduced levels of ho induced intrachromosomal recombination without significantly affecting the spontaneous frequency of ura+ recombination. one of the mutations isolated through this screen was found to affect the essential gene cdc. this mutation, cdc , completely eliminated ho induced ura+ recombination yet maintained both spontaneous preinduced recombination levels and cell viability, cdc mutants were moderately sensitive to killing by methyl methanesulfonate and gamma irradiation. the effect of the cdc mutation on recombinational double strand break repair indicates that a recombinationally silent mechanism other than sister chromatid exchange was responsible for the efficient repair of dna double strand breaks.
