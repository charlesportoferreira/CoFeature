use of an oligonucleotide probe to detect transplacement of an amber mutation into a yeast histone h gene.. . we have used a synthetic mer to direct mutagenesis of the cloned yeast histone h gene hht, creating an amber mutation at amino acid . this point mutation did not alter the restriction pattern of the hht gene nor was it expected to provide an easily scorable phenotype in vivo. therefore, nucleic acid hybridization was used to detect this point mutation during strain construction. the oligonucleotide was used to probe yeast genomic southern blots to detect integration of the plasmid bearing the mutant hht gene into the genome, and then to score the eventual excision of the plasmid vector with retention of the mutant gene on the chromosome. this technique can be used to score virtually any engineered point mutations in yeast.
