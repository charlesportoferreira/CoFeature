dna damage response mediated degradation of ho endonuclease via the ubiquitin system involves its nuclear export.. . yeast mating switch ho endonuclease is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin system and this depends on the dna damage response functions, mec, rad, and chk. a pest sequence marks ho for degradation. here we show that the novel f box receptor, ufo, recruits phosphorylated ho for degradation. mutation of pest residue threonine stabilizes ho, yet hota still binds ufo in vitro. stable hota accumulates within the nucleus, whereas hote is degraded. deletion of the nuclear exportin msn traps native ho in the nucleus and extends its half life. these experiments suggest that ho is degraded in the cytoplasm. in mec mutants stable ho accumulates within the nucleus; ho produced in mec cells does not bind ufo. thus the mec pathway has functions both in phosphorylation of thr for nuclear export and in additional phosphorylations for binding ufo. cells with ho under its genomic promoter, but stabilized by deletion of the msn exportin, proliferate, but are multibudded. these experiments elucidate some of the links between the dna damage response and degradation of ho by the ubiquitin system.
