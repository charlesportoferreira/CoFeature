a role for rev in mutagenesis during double strand break repair in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . recombinational repair of double strand breaks (dsbs), traditionally believed to be an error free dna repair pathway, was recently shown to increase the frequency of mutations in a nearby interval. the reversion rate of trp alleles (either nonsense or frameshift mutations) near an ho endonuclease cleavage site is increased at least fold among cells that have experienced an ho mediated dsb. we report here that in strains deleted for rev this dsb associated reversion of a nonsense mutation was greatly decreased. thus rev, which encodes a subunit of the translesion dna polymerase zeta, was responsible for the majority of these base substitution errors near a dsb. however, rev strains showed no decrease in ho stimulated recombination, implying that another dna polymerase also functioned in recombinational repair of a dsb. reversion of trp frameshift alleles near a dsb was not reduced in rev strains, indicating that another polymerase could act during dsb repair to make these frameshift errors. analysis of spontaneous reversion in haploid strains suggested that revp had a greater role in making point mutations than in frameshift mutations.
