the linker histone homolog hhop from saccharomyces cerevisiae represents a winged helix turn helix fold as determined by nmr spectroscopy.. . hhop is assumed to serve as a linker histone in saccharomyces cerevisiae and, notably, it possesses two putative globular domains, designated hd (residues ) and hd (residues ), that are homologous to histone h from chicken erythrocytes. we have determined the three dimensional structure of globular domain hd with high precision by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. the structure had a winged helix turn helix motif composed of an alphabetaalphaalphabetabeta fold and closely resembled the structure of the globular domain of histone h. interestingly, the second globular domain, hd, in hhop was unstructured under physiological conditions. gel mobility assay demonstrated that hhop preferentially binds to supercoiled dna over linearized dna. furthermore, nmr analysis of the complex of a deletion mutant protein (residues ) of hhop with a linear dna duplex revealed that four regions within the globular domain hd are involved in the dna binding. the above results suggested that hhop possesses properties similar to those of linker histones in higher eukaryotes in terms of the structure and binding preference towards supercoiled dna.
