a novel mre mutation impairs processing of double strand breaks of dna during both mitosis and meiosis.. . using complementation tests and nucleotide sequencing, we showed that the rad mutation was an allele of the mre gene and have renamed the mutation mre . two amino acid changes from the wild type sequence were identified; one is located at a conserved site of a phosphodiesterase motif, and the other is a homologous amino acid change at a nonconserved site. unlike mre null mutations, the mre mutation allowed meiosis specific double strand dna breaks (dsbs) to form at recombination hot spots but failed to process those breaks. dsb ends of this mutant were resistant to lambda exonuclease treatment. these phenotypes are similar to those of rads mutants. in contrast to rads, however, mre was highly sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate treatment. dsb end processing induced by ho endonuclease was suppressed in both mre and the mre disruption mutant. we constructed a new mre mutant that contains only the phosphodiesterase motif mutation of the mre protein and named it mre s. this mutant showed the same phenotypes observed in mre , suggesting that the phosphodiesterase consensus sequence is important for nucleolytic processing of dsb ends during both mitosis and meiosis.
