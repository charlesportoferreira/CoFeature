genetic analysis of the yeast nud endo exonuclease. a role in the repair of dna double strand breaks.. . the deoxyribonucleases (dnases) have been shown genetically to be important in the vital processes of dna repair and recombination. the nud gene, which codes for an endo exonuclease of saccharomyces cerevisiae, was analyzed for its role in the dna double strand break (dsb) repair processes. while the nud strain is only slightly sensitive to ionizing radiation, expression of the ho endonuclease to introduce a dsb at the mat locus in that strain results in cell death. cell survival is inversely proportional to the duration of ho endonuclease expression. analysis of the surviving colonies from the nud strain indicated that many of the survivors are sterile and that the proportion of these sterile survivors increases with the time of ho endonuclease expression. on the other hand, the surviving colonies from the isogenic nud strain are mating proficient. interestingly, double mutants of nud rad are more resistant to ionizing irradiation than the rad strain and have a cell survival fraction of % for rad nud and % for rad.ura nud following prolonged ho endonuclease expression, indicating that nud has a suppressor effect on the dsb induced lethality in rad. polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that many of the nud survivors contained small alterations within themat locus, suggesting that the survivors arose through the process of non homologous end joining. these results suggest that the endo exonuclease acts at a dsb to promote dna repair via the homologous recombination pathway.
