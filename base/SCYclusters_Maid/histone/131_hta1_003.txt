functional dissection of yeast hirp, a wd repeat containing transcriptional corepressor.. . the hir gene product is required to repress transcription of three of the four histone gene loci in saccharomyces cerivisiae, and like its counterpart, the hir protein, it functions as a transcriptional corepressor. although hirp and hirp are physically associated in yeast, hirp is able to function independently of hirp when it is artificially recruited to the histone hta promoter. a deletion analysis of hir has revealed two separate repression domains. one in its n terminus, where seven copies of the beta transducin or wd motif reside, and the second in the remaining c terminal amino acids. overexpression of the wd repeats in a hirdelta strain complemented its hir phenotype, while overexpression of the c terminus in a wild type strain caused both hir and spt phenotypes. the hirp c terminus physically interacted in vivo with hirp, and both hirp repression domains interacted with full length hirp. it was additionally found that the hirp wd repeats functionally interacted with the spt, spt, and spt gene products, suggesting that these repeats may direct hirp to different protein complexes.
