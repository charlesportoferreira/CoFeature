mutations in xrs and rad delay but do not prevent mating type switching in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, a large number of genes in the rad epistasis group has been implicated in the repair of chromosomal double strand breaks and in both mitotic and meiotic homologous recombination. while most of these genes are essential for yeast mating type (mat) gene switching, neither rad nor xrs is required to complete this specialized mitotic gene conversion process. using a galactose inducible ho endonuclease gene to initiate mat switching, we have examined the effect of null mutations of rad and of xrs on intermediate steps of this recombination event. both rad and xrs mutants exhibit a marked delay in the completion of switching. both mutations reduce the extent of ' to ' degradation from the end of the ho created double strand break. the steps of initial strand invasion and new dna synthesis are delayed by approximately min in mutant cells. however, later events are still further delayed, suggesting that xrs and rad affect more than one step in the process. in the rad xrs double mutant, the completion of mat switching is delayed more than in either single mutant, without reducing the overall efficiency of the process. the xrs gene encodes an amino acid protein with no obvious similarity to the rad protein or to any other protein in the database. overexpression of rad does not complement the defects in xrs or vice versa.
