creation and repair of specific dna double strand breaks in vivo following infection with adenovirus vectors expressing saccharomyces cerevisiae ho endonuclease.. . to study dna double strand break (dsb) repair in mammalian cells, the saccharomyces cerevisiae ho endonuclease gene, or its recognition site, was cloned into the adenovirus e or e regions. analysis of dna from human a cells coinfected with the e.ho gene and site viruses showed that ho endonuclease was active and that broken viral genomes were detectable h postinfection, increasing with time up to approximately % of the available ho site genomes. leftward fragments of approximately kbp, which contain the packaging signal, but not rightward fragments of approximately kbp, were incorporated into virions, suggesting that broken genomes were not held together tightly after cleavage. there was no evidence for dsb repair in e.ho virus coinfections. in contrast, such evidence was obtained in e.ho virus coinfections of nonpermissive cells, suggesting that adenovirus proteins expressed in the permissive e.ho coinfection can inhibit mammalian dsb repair. to test the inhibitory role of e proteins, known to suppress genome concatemer formation late in infection (weiden and ginsberg, ), a cells were coinfected with e.ho viruses lacking the e region. the results strongly suggest that the e protein(s) inhibits dsb repair. copyright academic press.
