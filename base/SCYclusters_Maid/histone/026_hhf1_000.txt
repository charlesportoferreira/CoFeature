sti and cdc can stabilize hsp in chaperone complexes with a protein kinase.. . hsp functions in association with several cochaperones for folding of protein kinases and transcription factors, although the relative contribution of each to the overall reaction is unknown. we assayed the role of nine different cochaperones in the activation of ste, a saccharomyces cerevisiae mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase. studies on signaling via this protein kinase pathway was measured by alpha factor stimulated induction of fig or lacz, and repression of hhf. several cochaperone mutants tested had reduced fig induction or hhf repression, although to differing extents. the greatest defects were in cprdelta, ssedelta, and ydjdelta mutants. assays of ste kinase activity revealed a pattern of defects in the cochaperone mutant strains that were similar to the gene expression studies. overexpression of cdc, a chaperone required for protein kinase folding, suppressed defects the stidelta mutant back to wild type levels. cdc overexpression also restored stable hsp binding to the ste protein kinase domain in the stidelta mutant strain. these data suggest that cdc and sti have functional overlap in stabilizing hsp.client complexes. finally, we show that cns functions in map kinase signaling in association with cpr.
