hirp and hirp function as transcriptional corepressors to regulate histone gene transcription in the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle.. . the hir/hpc (histone regulation/histone periodic control) negative regulators play important roles in the transcription of six of the eight core histone genes during the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. the phenotypes of hir and hir mutants suggested that the wild type hir and hir genes encode transcriptional repressors that function in the absence of direct dna binding. when hirp and hirp were artificially tethered to yeast promoters, each protein repressed transcription, suggesting that they represent a new class of transcriptional corepressors. the two proteins might function as a complex in vivo. hirp required both hirp and another hir protein, hirp, to repress transcription when it was tethered to an hta lacz reporter gene, and hirp and hirp could be coimmunoprecipitated from yeast cell extracts. tethered hirp also directed the periodic transcription of the hta gene and repressed hta transcription in response to two cell cycle regulatory signals. thus, it represents the first example of a transcriptional corepressor with a direct role in cell cycle regulated transcription.
