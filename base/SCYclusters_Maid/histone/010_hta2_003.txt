functional analysis of histones ha and hb in transcriptional repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the presence of ha hb dimers in nucleosomes can inhibit the binding of transcription factors to chromatin templates. to study the roles of histones ha and hb in transcriptional repression in vivo, mutant forms of these histones were analyzed in two different assay systems. two repression domains were identified in ha. one domain includes residues that fall in the beginning of the ha hb dimerization region, and the second is in the ha n terminus, a region of potential interactions with nonhistone proteins. the function of ha and hb in one repression assay was found to be dependent on three spt (suppressor of ty) genes whose products are important for chromatin mediated repression. these results suggest that repressive chromatin structure may be established through the interactions of the spt proteins with these histones. in contrast, other proteins, the products of the hir (histone regulation) genes, may function to direct ha and hb to specific promoters.
