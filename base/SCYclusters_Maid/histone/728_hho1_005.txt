histone h in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the existence of histone h in the yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, has long been debated. in this report we describe the presence of histone h in yeast. yplc, a gene encoding a protein with a high degree of similarity to histone h from other species was sequenced as part of the contribution of the montreal yeast genome sequencing group to chromosome xvi. to reflect this similarity, the gene designation has been changed hho (histone h one). the hho gene is highly expressed as poly a+ rna in yeast. although deletion of this gene had no detectable effect on cell growth, viability or mating, it significantly altered the expression of beta galactosidase from a cyc lacz reporter. fluorescence observed in cells expressing a histone h gfp protein fusion indicated that histone h is localized to the nucleus.
