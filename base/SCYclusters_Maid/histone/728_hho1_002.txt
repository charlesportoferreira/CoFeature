stochastic nucleosome positioning in a yeast chromatin region is not dependent on histone h.. . to gain a better understanding of the function of the yeast histone h, its role in nucleosome positioning was studied. with this objective in mind, we analyzed a chromatin region of the yeast chromosome (chr) ix, in which there are two closely packed open reading frames (orfs), pot and yilw. this locus shows a regular ladder of stochastically positioned nucleosomes, which is unaffected by the absence of the hho gene. this suggests that histone h has no effect on nucleosome positioning in yeast.
