histone histone interactions and centromere function.. . csep is a structural component of the core centromere of saccharomyces cerevisiae and is a member of the conserved cenp a family of specialized histone h variants. the histone h allele hhf confers defects in core centromere chromatin structure and mitotic chromosome transmission. we have proposed that csep and histone h interact through their respective histone fold domains to assemble a nucleosome like structure at centromeric dna. to test this model, we targeted random mutations to the csep histone fold domain and isolated three temperature sensitive cse alleles in an unbiased genetic screen. two of the cse alleles contain mutations at the csep h interface. one of these requires two widely separated mutations demonstrating long range cooperative interactions in the structure. the third cse allele is mutated at its helix helix interface, a region required for homotypic h fold dimerization. overexpression of wild type csep and histone h confer reciprocal allele specific suppression of cse and hhf mutations, providing strong evidence for csep h protein interaction. overexpression of histone h is dosage lethal in cse mutants, suggesting that histone h competes with csep for histone h binding. however, the relative resistance of the csep h pathway to h interference argues that centromere chromatin assembly must be highly regulated.
