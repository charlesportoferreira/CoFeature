synthesis of yeast histone in an escherichia coli cell free system.. . the gene for histone h from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was placed under the control of the lac promoter of escherichia coli by fusing the h coding sequence to that of beta galactosidase. the gene was shown to be transcribed in vivo, but its product was not detected in cell extracts. however, synthesis of the fused polypeptide was detected in an in vitro transcription translation system derived from e. coli. proteolytic degradation of the newly synthesized polypeptides may be the cause of their apparent absence in the in vivo experiment.
