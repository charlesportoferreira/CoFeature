suppression of homologous recombination by the saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone.. . the basic unit of chromatin in eukaryotes is the nucleosome, comprising bp of dna wound around two copies of each of four core histones. chromatin is further condensed by association with linker histones. saccharomyces cerevisiae hhop has sequence homology to other known linker histones and interacts with nucleosomes in vitro. however, disruption of hho results in no significant changes in the phenotypes examined thus far. here, we show that hhop is inhibitory to dna repair by homologous recombination (hr). we find hhop is abundant and associated with the genome, consistent with a global role in dna repair. furthermore, we establish that hhop is required for a full life span and propose that this is mechanistically linked to its role in hr. finally, we show that hhop is inhibitory to the recombination dependent mechanism of telomere maintenance. the role of linker histones in genome stability, aging, and tumorigenesis is discussed.
