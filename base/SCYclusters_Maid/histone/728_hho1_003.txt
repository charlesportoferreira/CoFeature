homology model building of hhop supports its role as a yeast histone h protein.. . biochemical studies to date have not been able to identify the linker histone h protein in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. database homology searching against the complete yeast genome has identified a gene, hho, (or yplc, formerly lpi) which encodes a protein that has two regions that show similarity to the pea histone h globular domain. to determine whether hhop can assume the shape of an h protein, homology model building experiments were performed using the structure of chicken histone h globular domain as the basis for comparison. a statistically significant match between each of the two globular domains of hhop and the chicken histone h structure was obtained, and probability values indicate that there is a less than in chance that such a match would be the result of a random event. these findings support the proposal that hhop acts as an &quot;h dimer&quot; and could be responsible for the decreased linker dna length observed between nucleosomal core particles.
