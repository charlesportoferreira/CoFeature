a functional interaction between the c terminal domain of rna polymerase ii and the negative regulator sin.. . the c terminal domain (ctd) of the largest subunit of yeast rna polymerase ii contains tandem copies of a conserved heptapeptide of unknown function. yeast strains whose ctd contains ten heptamers are viable but defective for transcription of the ino gene and cold sensitive for growth. deletion of the sin gene, which codes for a dna binding protein that negatively regulates ho transcription, restores ino transcription and reduces the cold sensitivity of such strains. a sin deletion suppresses the lethality of a ctd with nine heptamer repeats but not with seven repeats. these observations indicate a functional relationship between sin and the ctd. the ctd might remove sin from dna, or removal of sin may be a prerequisite for function of the ctd. the swi, swi, and swi genes, whose products activate ho transcription by antagonizing sin, are also required for ino transcription and may assist the ctd. in addition, an intact ctd binds nonspecifically to dna in vitro.
