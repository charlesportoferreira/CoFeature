yeast histone ha and hb amino termini have interchangeable functions.. . the n terminal ends of histones hb and ha have very different sequences and rates of evolution. however, they both extend from the nucleosome core and are positively charged. short sequences at the c termini of both proteins also differ from each other and appear to be hydrophilic. deletions at the n and c termini of yeast histones hb and ha do not obviously affect the cell's viability under normal growth conditions. however, deletions at the n termini of both hb and ha in the same cell are lethal or result in greatly reduced viability. even switching portions of the n termini between hb and ha to create two chimeric histone proteins within the same cell has no obvious effect on viability. this supports the argument that the n terminal end of one protein complements the function of the other.
