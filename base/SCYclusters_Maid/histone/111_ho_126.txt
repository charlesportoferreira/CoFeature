characterization of double strand break induced recombination. homology requirements and single stranded dna formation.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, a double strand chromosome break created by the ho endonuclease is frequently repaired in mitotically growing cells by recombination between flanking homologous regions, producing a deletion. we showed that single stranded regions were formed on both sides of the double strand break prior to the formation of the product. the kinetics of the single stranded dna were monitored in strains with the recombination deficient mutations rad and rad as well as in the wild type strain. in rad mutants, single stranded dna was generated at a slower rate than in the wild type, whereas rad mutants generated single stranded dna at a faster rate. product formation was largely blocked in the rad mutant. in the rad rad double mutant, the effects were superimposed in that the exonucleolytic activity was slowed but product formation was blocked. rad appears to act before or at the same stage as rad. we constructed strains containing two ura segments on one side of the ho cut site and one ura region on the other side to characterize how flanking repeats find each other. deletions formed preterentially between the homologous regions closest to the double strand break. by varying the size of the middle ura segment, we determined that recombination initiated by a double strand break requires a minimum homologous length between and bp. in these competition experiments, the frequency of recombination was dependent on the length of homology in an approximately linear manner.
