specific distribution of the saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone homolog hhop in the chromatin.. . in virtually all eukaryotic organisms, linker dna between nucleosomes is associated with a histone termed linker histone or histone h. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hho encodes a putative linker histone with very significant homology to histone h. the encoded protein is expressed in the nucleus, but has not been shown to affect global chromatin structure, nor has its deletion shown any detectable phenotype. in vitro chromatin assembly experiments with recombinant hhop have shown that it is able to complex with dinuncleosomes in a similar manner to histone h. here we report that while disruption of hho has little affect on rna levels of most cellular transcripts, there are numerous exceptions. measurement of hhop concentration in the wild type cell showed a stoichiometry of about one hhop molecule per nucleosomes. localization of hhop in the chromatin, using an immunoprecipitation technique, showed preferential hhop binding to rdna sequences. these results suggest that hhop may play a similar role to linker histones, but at restricted locations in the chromatin.
