sin mutations of histone h. influence on nucleosome core structure and function.. . sin mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae alleviate transcriptional defects that result from the inactivation of the yeast swvi/snf complex. we have investigated the structural and functional consequences for the nucleosome of sin mutations in histone h. we directly test the hypothesis that mutations in histone h leading to a swi/snf independent (sin) phenotype in yeast lead to nucleosomal destabilization. in certain instances this is shown to be true; however, nucleosomal destabilization does not always occur. topoisomerase i mediated relaxation of minichromosomes assembled with either mutant histone h or wild type h together with histones ha, hb, and h indicates that dna is constrained into nucleosomal structures containing either mutant or wild type proteins. however, nucleosomes containing particular mutant h molecules (r h and t i) are more accessible to digestion by micrococcal nuclease and do not constrain dna in a precise rotational position, as revealed by digestion with dnase i. this result establishes that sin mutations in histone h located close to the dyad axis can destabilize histone dna contacts at the periphery of the nucleosome core. other nucleosomes containing a distinct mutant h molecule (e k) associated with a sin phenotype show very little change in nucleosome structure and stability compared to wild type nucleosomes. both mutant and wild type nucleosomes continue to restrict the binding of either tata binding protein/transcription factor iia (tfiia) or the rna polymerase iii transcription machinery. thus, different sin mutations in histone h alter the stability of histone dna interactions to various extents in the nucleosome while maintaining the fundamental architecture of the nucleosome and contributing to a common sin phenotype.
