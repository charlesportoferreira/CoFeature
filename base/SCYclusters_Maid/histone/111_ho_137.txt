hrr, a putative protein kinase from budding yeast. association with repair of damaged dna.. . in simple eukaryotes, protein kinases regulate mitotic and meiotic cell cycles, the response to polypeptide pheromones, and the initiation of nuclear dna synthesis. the protein hrr from the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was defined by the mutation hrr . this mutation resulted in sensitivity to continuous expression of the ho double strand endonuclease, to methyl methanesulfonate, and to x irradiation. homozygotes of hrr were unable to sporulate and disruption and deletion of hrr interfered with mitotic and meiotic cell division. sequence analysis revealed two distinctive regions in the protein. the nh terminus of hrr contains the hallmark features of protein kinases, whereas the cooh terminus is rich in proline and glutamine. mutations in hrr at conserved residues found in all protein kinases inactivated the gene, and these mutants exhibited the hrr null phenotypes. taken together, the hrr mutant phenotypes and the features of the gene product indicate that hrr is a distinctive member of the protein kinase superfamily.
