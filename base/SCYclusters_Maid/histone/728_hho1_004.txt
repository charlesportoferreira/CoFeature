the biochemical and phenotypic characterization of hhop, the putative linker histone h of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . there is currently no published report on the isolation and definitive identification of histone h in saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was, however, recently shown that the yeast hho gene codes for a predicted protein homologous to h of higher eukaryotes (landsman, d. () trends biochem. sci. , ; ushinsky, s. c., bussey, h. , ahmed, a. a., wang, y., friesen, j., williams, b. a., and storms, r. k. () yeast , ), although there is no biochemical evidence that shows that hhop is, indeed, yeast histone h. we showed that purified recombinant hhop (rhhop) has electrophoretic and chromatographic properties similar to linker histones. the protein forms a stable ternary complex with a reconstituted core di nucleosome in vitro at molar rhhop.core ratios up to . reconstitution of rhhop with h stripped chromatin confers a kinetic pause at approximately base pairs in the micrococcal nuclease digestion pattern of the chromatin. these results strongly suggest that hhop is a bona fide linker histone. we deleted the hho gene and showed that the strain is viable and has no growth or mating defects. hhop is not required for telomeric silencing, basal transcriptional repression, or efficient sporulation. unlike core histone mutations, a hhodelta strain does not exhibit a sin or spt phenotype. the absence of hhop does not lead to a change in the nucleosome repeat length of bulk chromatin nor to differences in the in vivo micrococcal nuclease cleavage sites in individual genes as detected by primer extension mapping.
