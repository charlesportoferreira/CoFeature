yeast dna ligase iv mediates non homologous dna end joining.. . the discovery of homologues from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae of the human ku dna end binding proteins (hdf and ku) has established that this organism is capable of non homologous double strand end joining (nhej), a form of dna double strand break repair (dsbr) active in mammalian v(d)j recombination. identification of the dna ligase that mediates nhej in yeast will help elucidate the function of the four mammalian dna ligases in dsbr, v(d)j recombination and other reactions. here we show that s. cerevisiae has two typical dna ligases, the known dna ligase i homologue cdc and the previously unknown dna ligase iv homologue dnl. dnl mutants are deficient in precise and end processed nhej. dnl and hdf are epistatic in this regard, with the mutation of each having equivalent effects. dnl mutants are complemented by overexpression of dnl but not of cdc, and deficiency of dnl alone does not impair either cell growth or the cdc mediated responses to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation. thus, s. cerevisiae has two distinct and separate ligation pathways.
