removal of one nonhomologous dna end during gene conversion by a rad and msh independent pathway.. . repair of a double strand break (dsb) by homologous recombination depends on the invasion of a ' ended strand into an intact template sequence to initiate new dna synthesis. when the end of the invading dna is not homologous to the donor, the nonhomologous sequences must be removed before new synthesis can begin. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the removal of these ends depends on both the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease radp/radp and the mismatch repair proteins mshp/mshp. in rad or msh mutants, when both ends of the dsb have nonhomologous ends, repair is reduced approximately fold compared to a plasmid with perfect ends; however, with only one nonhomologous end, repair is reduced on average only fold. these results suggest that yeast has an alternative, but less efficient, way to remove a nonhomologous tail from the second end participating in gene conversion. when the removal of one nonhomologous end is impaired in rad and msh mutants, there is also a hr delay in the appearance of crossover products of gene conversion, compared to noncrossovers. we interpret these results in terms of the formation and resolution of alternative intermediates of a synthesis dependent strand annealing mechanism.
