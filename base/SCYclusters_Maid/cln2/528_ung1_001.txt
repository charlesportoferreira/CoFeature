hsmug can functionally compensate for ung in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . there are at least four distinct families of enzymes that recognize and remove uracil from dna. family (smug) enzymes have recently been identified and have a preference for uracil in single stranded dna when assayed in vitro. here we investigate the in vivo function of smug using the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. these organisms lack a smug homologue and use a single enzyme, ung to carry out uracil repair. when a wild type strain is treated with antifolate agents to induce uracil misincorporation into dna, s phase arrest and cellular toxicity occurs. the arrest is characteristic of checkpoint activation due to single strand breaks caused by continuous uracil removal and self defeating dna repair. when uracil dna glycosylase is deleted (deltaung), cells continue through s phase and arrest at g()/m, presumably due to the effects of stable uracil misincorporation in dna. pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) demonstrates that cells are able to complete dna replication with uracil substituted dna and do not experience the extensive strand breakage attributed to uracil dna glycosylase mediated repair. as a result, these cells experience early protection from antifolate induced cytotoxicity. when either ung or smug functions are reintroduced back into the null strain and then subjected to antifolate treatment, the cells revert back to the wild type phenotype as shown by a restored sensitivity to drug and s phase arrest. the arrest is accompanied by the accumulation of replication intermediates as determined by pfge. collectively, these data indicate that smug can act as a functional homolog of the family uracil dna glycosylase enzymes.
