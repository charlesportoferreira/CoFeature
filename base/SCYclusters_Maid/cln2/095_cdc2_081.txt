stably denatured regions in chromosomal dna from the cdc saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle mutant.. . dna isolated from saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying temperature sensitive mutations in the cdc gene after incubation at the restrictive temperature contains multiple stably denatured regions to base pairs long. these regions are probably stabilized by a dna binding protein. they are found in both replicated and unreplicated portions of dna molecules, suggesting that they are not an early stage in the initiation of dna replication.
