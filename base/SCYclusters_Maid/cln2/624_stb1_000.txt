a large protein complex containing the yeast sinp and rpdp transcriptional regulators.. . the sin gene is required for the transcriptional repression of diverse genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. sinp does not bind directly to dna but is thought to be targeted to promoters by interacting with sequence specific dna binding proteins. we show here that sinp is present in a large multiprotein complex with an apparent molecular mass, estimated by gel filtration chromatography, of greater than million da. genetic studies have shown that the yeast rpd gene has a function similar to that of sin in transcriptional regulation, as sin and rpd negatively regulate the same set of genes. the sin and rpd genes are conserved from yeasts to mammals, and recent work suggests that rpd may encode a histone deacetylase. we show that rpdp is present in the sinp complex and that an rpd mutation eliminates sin dependent repression. thus, sinp may function as a bridge to recruit the rpdp histone deacetylase to specific promoters.
