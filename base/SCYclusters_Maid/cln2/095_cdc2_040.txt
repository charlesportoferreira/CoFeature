afc, a lammer kinase from arabidopsis thaliana, activates ste dependent processes in yeast.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae a kinase cascade activates the transcription factor ste leading to mating in haploid cells and pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells. to investigate related signal transduction pathways in higher plants, we have isolated a putative protein kinase gene from arabidopsis thaliana that restores ste dependent functions to yeast with mutations in this signal transduction pathway. this arabidopsis gene, afc, induces three ste dependent processes even in signal transduction defective yeast strains. mating specific gene expression in haploid yeast, mating of haploid yeast to yield diploids, and pseudohyphal growth in diploid yeast. afc has no effect on transcription of the ste gene and, instead, is likely to activate the ste protein. however, afc has only limited homology to fus and kss, the endogenous yeast kinase regulators of ste. afc is a member of a recently described cdc related kinase subfamily, the lammer kinases. a close afc homolog, afc, lacks ste activation phenotypes, indicating the specificity of afc. the phenotypes of afc in yeast provide us with tools to elucidate the role of this kinase in arabidopsis.
