mms, encoding a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme like protein, is a member of the yeast error free postreplication repair pathway.. . among the three saccharomyces cerevisiae dna repair epistasis groups, the rad group is the most complicated and least characterized, primarily because it consists of two separate repair pathways. an error free postreplication repair pathway, and a mutagenesis pathway. the rad and rad mutants are defective in both pathways, and the rev mutant affects only the mutagenesis pathway, but a yeast gene that is involved only in error free postreplication repair has not been reported. we cloned the mms gene from a yeast genomic library by functional complementation of the mms mutant [prakash, l. &amp; prakash, s. () genetics , ]. mms encodes a amino acid, . kda protein with significant sequence homology to a conserved family of ubiquitin conjugating (ubc) proteins. however, mms does not appear to possess ubc activity. genetic analyses indicate that the mms mutation is hypostatic to rad and rad but is synergistic with the rev mutation, and the mms mutant is proficient in uv induced mutagenesis. these phenotypes are reminiscent of a pol mutant known to be impaired in postreplication repair. the mms mutant also displayed a rev dependent mutator phenotype, strongly suggesting that the mms gene functions in the error free postreplication repair pathway, parallel to the rev mutagenesis pathway. furthermore, with respect to uv sensitivity, mms was found to be hypostatic to the raddelta mutation, which results in the absence of the first nine amino acids of rad. on the basis of these collective results, we propose that the mms null mutation and two other allele specific mutations, raddelta and pol , define the error free mode of dna postreplication repair, and that these mutations may enhance both spontaneous and dna damage induced mutagenesis.
