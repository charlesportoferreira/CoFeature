direct selection of conserved cdnas from the digeorge critical region. isolation of a novel cdc like gene.. . we have used a modified direct selection technique to detect transcripts that are both evolutionary conserved and developmentally expressed. the enrichment for homologous mouse cdnas by use of human genomic dna as template is shown to be an efficient and rapid approach for generating transcript maps. deletions of human q are associated with several clinical syndromes, with overlapping phenotypes, for example, velocardiofacial syndrome (vcfs) and digeorge syndrome (dgs). a large number of transcriptional units exist within the defined critical region, many of which have been identified previously by direct selection. however, no single obvious candidate gene for the vcfs/dgs phenotype has yet been found. our technique has been applied to the digeorge critical region and has resulted in the isolation of a novel candidate gene, cdcl, similar to yeast cdcp.
