the human minisatellites ms, ms, ms and ceb integrated into the yeast genome exhibit different degrees of mitotic instability but are all stabilised by rad.. . the yeast rad protein is homologous to mammalian fen and is involved in the processing of replication intermediates. enhanced instability of various artificial repetitive dna sequences in rad deficient yeast strains has been observed previously and shown to involve preferentially expansion mutations. in the present investigation, we characterised the mitotic instability of alleles of the naturally occurring human minisatellites ms, ms, ms and ceb and the modified ms alleles containing more highly homogeneous repeat regions than the original alleles. these minisatellites demonstrated more pronounced instability in rad delta strains, with increases in the frequencies of both expansion and contraction mutants. in rad strains, ms and ms were relatively stable, while ms and ceb were unstable, indicating that the effect of rad on stability is influenced by intrinsic properties of the repeat array. this conclusion received further support from the remarkably high frequency of length mutants observed for the modified allele of ms. thus, our findings emphasise the importance of.
