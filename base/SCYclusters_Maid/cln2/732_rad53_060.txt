a rad kinase dependent surveillance mechanism that regulates histone protein levels in s. cerevisiae.. . rad and mec are protein kinases required for dna replication and recovery from dna damage in saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, we show that rad, but not mec mutants, are extremely sensitive to histone overexpression, as rad is required for degradation of excess histones. consequently, excess histones accumulate in rad mutants, resulting in slow growth, dna damage sensitivity, and chromosome loss phenotypes that are significantly suppressed by a reduction in histone gene dosage. rad monitors excess histones by associating with them in a dynamic complex that is modulated by its kinase activity. our results argue that rad contributes to genome stability independently of mec by preventing the damaging effects of excess histones both during normal cell cycle progression and in response to dna damage.
