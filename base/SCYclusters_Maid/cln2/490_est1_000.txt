telomere cap components influence the rate of senescence in telomerase deficient yeast cells.. . cells lacking telomerase undergo senescence, a progressive reduction in cell division that involves a cell cycle delay and culminates in &quot;crisis,&quot; a period when most cells become inviable. in telomerase deficient saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking components of the nonsense mediated mrna decay (nmd) pathway (upf,upf, or upf proteins), senescence is delayed, with crisis occurring approximately to population doublings later than in upf+ cells. delayed senescence is seen in upfdelta cells lacking the telomerase holoenzyme components estp and tlc rna, as well as in cells lacking the telomerase regulators estp and estp. the delay of senescence in upfdelta cells is not due to an increased rate of survivor formation. rather, it is caused by alterations in the telomere cap, composed of cdcp, stnp, and tenp. in upfdelta mutants, stn and ten levels are increased. increasing the levels of stnp and tenp in upf+ cells is sufficient to delay senescence. in addition, cdc mutants exhibit delayed senescence rates similar to those of upfdelta cells. thus, changes in the telomere cap structure are sufficient to affect the rate of senescence in the absence of telomerase. furthermore, the nmd pathway affects the rate of senescence in telomerase deficient cells by altering the stoichiometry of telomere cap components.
