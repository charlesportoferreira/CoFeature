overexpression of budp can suppress mutations in the gspp guanine nucleotide exchange factor prpp in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the gene product prpp, which is located in the nucleus, serves as the nucleotide exchange factor (gef) for the small nuclear g protein gspp in saccharomyces cerevisiae, and catalyses the replacement of gsp bound gdp by gtp. these proteins are involved in numerous cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of macromolecules, cell cycle progression, dna replication and maintenance of chromosome structure/stability. it is believed that in order to complete a full gdp/gtp cycle, gspp has to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where its gtpase activating protein (gap) rnap is located. here, we report on the ability of budp, the exchange factor for rsrp, to suppress conditional prp mutants when an extra copy of gsp is present. this suppression by bud can be reversed by simultaneous overexpression of rna, and is not rsrp dependent, nor allele specific. we also show that budp can physically interact with gsplp, both in vitro and in vivo. these,findings raise the possibility that budp could act as a cytoplasmic exchange factor for gspp and, therefore, that a complete gdp/gtp cycle could take place in the cytoplasm.
