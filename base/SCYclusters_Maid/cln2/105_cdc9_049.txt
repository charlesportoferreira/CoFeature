the nucleotide sequence of the dna ligase gene (cdc) from saccharomyces cerevisiae. a gene which is cell cycle regulated and induced in response to dna damage.. . the cdc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a dna ligase, and we have determined the nucleotide sequence of a . kb fragment of dna which encompasses the convergently transcribed cdc and cdc genes. s nuclease mapping has revealed a major ' end for the cdc mrna, and one major and one minor site for ' polyadenylation. these two sites lie within the c terminal coding region of the cdc gene, implying that these two genes are transcribed from overlapping sequences. an interesting structural feature of the cdc gene is a series of hexanucleotide repeats (atgatt) which occur within the bp immediately upstream from the site of transcription initiation. these repeat elements may be implicated in the cell division cycle regulated expression of cdc. comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the yeast dna ligase (mr ,) with the sequences of the t and t bacteriophage dna ligases reveals little similarity except for a stretch of approximately amino acids, comprising short homologous segments. this region may represent an atp binding domain common to polynucleotide ligases.
