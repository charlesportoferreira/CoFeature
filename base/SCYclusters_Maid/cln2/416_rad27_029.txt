relationships between yeast rad and apn in response to apurinic/apyrimidinic (ap) sites in dna.. . yeast rad is a ' &gt;' exonuclease and a flap endo nuclease. apn is the major apurinic/apyrimidinic (ap) endonuclease in yeast. the rad deletion mutants are highly sensitive to methylmethane sulfonate (mms). by examining the role of rad in different modes of dna excision repair, we wish to understand why the cytotoxic effect of mms is dramatically enhanced in the absence of rad. base excision repair (ber) of uracil containing dna was deficient in rad mutant extracts in that (i) the apn activity was reduced, and (ii) after dna incision by apn, hydrolysis of nucleotides ' to the baseless sugar phosphate was deficient. thus, some ap sites may lead to unprocessed dna strand breaks in rad mutant cells. the severe mms sensitivity of rad mutants is not caused by a reduction of the apn activity. surprisingly, we found that apn endonuclease sensitizes rad mutant cells to mms. deleting the apn gene largely restored the resistance of rad mutants to mms. these results suggest that unprocessed dna strand breaks at ap sites are mainly responsible for the mms sensitivity of rad mutants. in contrast, nucleotide excision repair and ber of oxidative damage were not affected in rad mutant extracts, indicating that rad is specifically required for ber of ap sites in dna.
