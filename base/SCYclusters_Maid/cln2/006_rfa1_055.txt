the kda subunit of replication protein a is required for the g/s and intra s dna damage checkpoints in budding yeast.. . the rfa m and rfa m saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants, which are altered in the kda subunit of replication protein a (rpa) and sensitive to uv and methyl methane sulfonate (mms), have been analyzed for possible checkpoint defects. the g/s and intra s dna damage checkpoints are defective in the rfa m mutant, since rfa m cells fail to properly delay cell cycle progression in response to uv irradiation in g and mms treatment during s phase. conversely, the g/m dna damage checkpoint and the s/m checkpoint are proficient in rfa m cells and all the checkpoints tested are functional in the rfa m mutant. preventing s phase entry by alpha factor treatment after uv irradiation in g does not change rfa m cell lethality, while it allows partial recovery of rfa m cell viability. therefore, the hypersensitivity to uv and mms treatments observed in the rfa m mutant might only be due to impairment of rpa function in dna repair, while the rfa m mutation seems to affect both the dna repair and checkpoint functions of rpa.
