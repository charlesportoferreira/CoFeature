the yeast analog of mammalian cyclin/proliferating cell nuclear antigen interacts with mammalian dna polymerase delta.. . dna polymerase iii from saccharomyces cerevisiae is analogous to the mammalian dna polymerase delta by several criteria, including an increased synthetic activity on poly(da).oligo(dt) (. nucleotide ratio) in the presence of calf thymus proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), or cyclin. this stimulation assay has been used to purify the yeast analog of pcna/cyclin (ypcna) to homogeneity. ypcna is a trimer or tetramer (mr approximately ,) of identical subunits with a denatured mr of ,. on a molar basis ypcna and calf thymus pcna/cyclin are equally active in stimulating dna synthesis by dna polymerase iii. about times more ypcna than calf thymus pcna/cyclin is needed, however, to stimulate calf thymus dna polymerase delta, and the degree of stimulation obtained at saturating levels of ypcna is a factor of less than with calf thymus pcna/cyclin. both stimulatory proteins exert their effect in an identical fashion, i.e., by increasing the processivity of the dna polymerase. yeast dna polymerases i and ii and calf thymus dna polymerase alpha are not stimulated by ypcna. treatment of logarithmic phase cells with hydroxyurea blocks them in the s phase and produces a to fold increase in ypcna.
