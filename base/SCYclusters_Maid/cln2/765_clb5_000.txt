overexpression of b type cyclins alters chromosomal segregation.. . to identify genes which overexpression results into chromosomal instability (cin), we developed a biological approach based on a yeast indicator strain in which cin can be detected by a sectoring phenotype. screening in this strain of a yeast genomic library cloned into a high copy vector led us to identify, among the clones generating % of sectoring colonies, clb, one of the six b type cyclins present in yeast. overexpression of cyclin b and cyclin b, the two human homologs of clb, in the cin indicator strain resulted also into a sectoring phenotype and induced, like overexpression of clb, an abnormal sensitivity to benomyl, indicating that overexpression of b type cyclins alters the spindle checkpoint. in a series of primary colorectal cancers, we detected in five tumors (%) an accumulation of cyclin b, which was neither related to mrna overexpression nor to mutation within the coding region, and in five other tumors (%) a fold increase of cyclin b mrna which was not related to gene amplification. these results suggest that overexpression of cyclins b, resulting from different mechanisms, could contribute, through an alteration of the spindle checkpoint, to the chromosomal instability observed in cancer.
