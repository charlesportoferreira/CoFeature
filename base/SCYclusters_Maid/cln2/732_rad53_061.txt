cdc kinases (ddks) and checkpoint responses. lessons from two yeasts.. . principally characterized for its requirement in the initiation of dna replication, compelling evidence from two yeast model organisms now points to a central role for the dbf/cdc kinase complex in s phase checkpoint responses. among the key findings supporting this view are observations that orthologs dfp (schizosaccharomyces pombe) and dbf (saccharomyces cerevisiae) interact with equivalent checkpoint kinases cds and rad, respectively, and that mutants for dbf and cdc in these species are sensitive to genotoxic agents. recently, these findings have been extended through mutational analyses of conserved regions in both dfp and dbf, leading to the identification of distinct motifs which mediate cellular responses to dna damage and replication fork arrest. the present review is a comparative survey of data obtained from studies conducted with s. pombe and s. cerevisae, and a consideration of models for the role played by dbf/cdc in checkpoint responses.
