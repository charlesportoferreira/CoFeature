characterization of schizosaccharomyces pombe rad protein, a fen homolog.. . fen proteins are a family of nucleases essential for lagging strand dna synthesis. a gene with sequence similarity to fen protein encoding genes, rad +, has been identified in schizosaccharomyces pombe . we report the overexpression, purification, and character ization of the putative s.pombe fen homolog, radp. a gst radp fusion protein was over expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae and purified to near homogeneity by gst affinity chromatography. although radp had been previously classified as a putative fen protein based on amino acid homology, there has been no biochemical evidence demonstrating flap endonuclease activity. dna cleavage analysis of several different oligodeoxynucleotide structuresindicates that gst radp possesses both ' flap endonuclease and ' &gt;' double stranded dna exo nuclease activities. gst radp incises a ' flap and a ' pseudo y structure one base ' of the branch point in the duplex region and also degrades double stranded dna. this is the first report on the biochemical characterization of s.pombe radp. the potential roles of radp in dna excision repair and other nucleic acid reactions are discussed.
