cdc delivers separate complexes to the telomere for end protection and replication.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomere binding protein cdc mediates telomere replication by recruiting telomerase, and also performs an essential function in chromosome end protection. we show here that delivery of the stn protein to the telomere, by fusing the dna binding domain of cdc (dbd(cdc)) to stn, is sufficient to rescue the lethality of a cdc null strain and, hence, provide end protection. telomere replication is still defective in this strain, but can be restored by delivering telomerase to the telomere as a dbd(cdc) telomerase fusion. these results establish stn as the primary effector of chromosome end protection, whereas the principal function of cdc is to provide a loading platform to recruit complexes that provide end protection and telomere replication.
