role of ume in transcriptional regulation of a dna repair gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae uv radiation and a variety of chemical dna damaging agents induce the transcription of specific genes, including several involved in dna repair. one of the best characterized of these genes is phr, which encodes the apoenzyme for dna photolyase. basal level and damage induced expression of phr require an upstream activation sequence, uas(phr), which has homology with drc elements found upstream of at least other dna repair and dna metabolism genes in yeast. here we report the identification of the ume gene of s. cerevisiae as a regulator of uas(phr) activity. multiple copies of ume stimulate expression from uas(phr) and the intact phr gene. surprisingly, the effect of deletion of ume is growth phase dependent. in wild type cells phr is induced in late exponential phase, concomitant with the initiation of glycogen accumulation that precedes the diauxic shift. deletion of ume abolishes this induction, decreases the steady state concentration of photolyase molecules and phr mrna, and increases the uv sensitivity of a rad mutant. despite the fact that uas(phr) does not contain the urs sequence, which has been previously implicated in ume mediated transcriptional regulation, we find that umep binds to uas(phr) with an affinity and a specificity similar to those seen for a urs site. similar binding is also seen for drc elements from rad, rad, and rad, suggesting that ume contributes to the regulated expression of a subset of damage responsive genes in yeast.
