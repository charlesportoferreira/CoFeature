cloning and characterisation of the schizosaccharomyces pombe rad gene, a member of the snf helicase family.. . the schizosaccharomyces pombe rad mutant is sensitive to both uv and gamma irradiation. we have cloned the rad gene by complementation of the uv sensitivity of a rad. mutant strain. the gene comprises an open reading frame of . kb which does not contain any introns and is capable of encoding a amino acid protein of kda. deletion of the gene indicates that it is not essential for cell viability. recognisable motifs are present for a nuclear localisation signal, a ring finger and helicase domains. the predicted protein is a member of the snf subfamily of proteins and shows particular homology to the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein. double mutant analysis demonstrated that the rad mutant is not epistatic to mutants in the excision repair pathway (rad) or checkpoint pathway (rad). analysis of radiation sensitivity though the cell cycle indicates that, unlike most other rad mutants, rad is most sensitive to irradiation during the g/s period.
