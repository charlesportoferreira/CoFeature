identification and sequence analysis of a rap gene from the true slime mold physarum polycephalum.. . a member of the ras gene superfamily, belonging to the rap family and designated pprap, was isolated from a cdna library from the true slime mold physarum polycephalum by plaque hybridization in combination with ' race. the assembled nucleotide sequence of pprap ( bp) has an open reading frame coding for a protein of amino acids of a calculated m(r) of . this protein exhibits. (i) a highly conserved gtp binding domain containing a putative effector domain, with the threonine for glutamine substitution characteristic of rap proteins, (ii) a hypervariable domain, and (iii) the caax motif. analysis of the c terminal amino acid sequence of pprap shows that it presumably undergoes geranylgeranylation but is not palmitoylated; however, it contains a lysine rich domain which might serve as the second membrane localization signal. pprap exhibits significantly high amino acid homology within the gtp binding domain with its homologues. ddrap from dictyostelium discoideum (%) and human rapa (%), and relatively low homology (%) with the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue, rsr. it has also % and % homology with the p. polycephalum ppras and ppras proteins, respectively. this gene is the third member of the ras gene superfamily identified in p. polycephalum so far.
