replication factor a is required in vivo for dna replication, repair, and recombination.. . replication factor a (rf a) is a heterotrimeric single stranded dna binding protein which is conserved in all eukaryotes. since the availability of conditional mutants is an essential step to define functions and interactions of rf a in vivo, we have produced and characterized mutations in the rfa gene, encoding the p subunit of the complex in saccharomyces cerevisiae. this analysis provides the first in vivo evidence that rf a function is critical not only for dna replication but also for efficient dna repair and recombination. moreover, genetic evidence indicate that p interacts both with the dna polymerase alpha primase complex and with dna polymerase delta.
