characterization of insertion mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae msh and msh genes. evidence for separate mitochondrial and nuclear functions.. . the msh and msh genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae are predicted to encode proteins that are homologous to the escherichia coli muts and streptococcus pneumoniae hexa proteins and their homologs. disruption of the msh gene caused a petite phenotype which was established rapidly. a functional msh gene present on a single copy centromere plasmid was incapable of rescuing the established msh petite phenotype. analysis of msh strains demonstrated that mutagenesis and large scale rearrangement of mitochondrial dna had occurred. ', diamidino phenylindole (dapi) staining of msh yeast revealed an aberrant distribution of mtdna. haploid msh mutants displayed an increase of fold in the rate of spontaneous mutation to canavanine resistance. sporulation of homozygous msh/msh diploids gave rise to a high level of lethality which was compounded during increased vegetative growth prior to sporulation. msh mutations also affected gene conversion of two his alleles. the hisx mutation, lying near the ' end of the gene, was converted with equal frequency in both wild type and msh strains. however, many of the events in the msh background were post meiotic segregation (pms) events (.%) while none (&lt; .%) of the aberrant segregations in wild type were pms events. the hisb allele, lying . kb downstream of hisx, was converted at a fold higher frequency in the msh background than in the corresponding wild type strain. like the hisx allele, hisb showed a high level of pms (%) in the msh background compared to the corresponding wild type strain where no (&lt; .%) pms events were observed. these results indicate that msh plays a role in repair or stability of mtdna and msh plays a role in repair of bp insertion/deletion mispairs in the nucleus.
