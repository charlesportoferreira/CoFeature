functions of saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins in response to dna damage and to dna replication stress.. . two members of the protein family, involved in key biological processes in different eukaryotes, are encoded by the functionally redundant saccharomyces cerevisiae bmh and bmh genes. we produced and characterized independent bmh mutant alleles, whose presence in the cell as the sole source causes hypersensitivity to genotoxic agents, indicating that bmh proteins are required for proper response to dna damage. in particular, the bmh and bmh mutant alleles cause defects in g/s and g/m dna damage checkpoints, whereas only the g/m checkpoint is altered by the bmh and bmh alleles. impaired checkpoint responses correlate with the inability to maintain phosphorylated forms of rad and/or chk, suggesting that bmh proteins might regulate phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these checkpoint kinases. moreover, several bmh bmhdelta mutants are defective in resuming dna replication after transient deoxynucleotide depletion, and all display synthetic effects when also carrying mutations affecting the polalpha primase and rpa dna replication complexes, suggesting a role for bmh proteins in dna replication stress response. finally, the bmh bmhdelta and bmh bmhdelta mutants show increased rates of spontaneous gross chromosomal rearrangements, indicating that bmh proteins are required to suppress genome instability.
