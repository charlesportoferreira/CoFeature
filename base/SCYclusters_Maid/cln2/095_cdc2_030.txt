effects of the cdc gene on adaptive mutation in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have studied the influence of a temperature sensitive cdc mutation in dna polymerase delta on the selection induced mutation occurring at the lys locus in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. it was found that in cells plated on synthetic complete medium lacking only lysine, the numbers of lys+ revertant colonies accumulated in a time dependent manner in the absence of any detectable increase in cell number. when cdc mutant cells, after selective plating, were incubated at the restrictive temperature of degrees c for h daily for days, the frequency of an adaptive reversion of lys( ) &gt;lys+ was significantly higher than the frequency in cells incubated only at the permissive temperature, or in wild type cells incubated either at degrees c or degrees c. therefore, when the proofreading activity of dna polymerase delta is impaired under restrictive conditions, the frequency of adaptive mutations is markedly enhanced.
