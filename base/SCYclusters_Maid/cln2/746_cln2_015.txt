ubiquitination and degradation of the substrate recognition subunits of scf ubiquitin protein ligases.. . the s. cerevisiae scfcdcp ubiquitin protein ligase complex promotes cell cycle transitions through degradation of cell cycle regulators. to investigate scfcdcp regulation in vivo, we examined the stability of individual scfcdcp components. whereas cdcp and skpp were stable, cdcp, the f box containing component responsible for substrate recognition, was short lived and subject to scf mediated ubiquitination. grrp, another f box component of scf complexes, was also ubiquitinated. a stable truncated cdcpf beta gal hybrid protein capable of binding skpp and entering into an scf complex interfered with proteolysis of scf targets and inhibited cell proliferation. the finding that the f box containing scf components are unstable suggests a mechanism of regulating scf function through ubiquitination and proteolysis of f box components.
