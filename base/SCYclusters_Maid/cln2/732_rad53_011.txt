role of the n terminal forkhead associated domain in the cell cycle checkpoint function of the rad kinase.. . forkhead associated (fha) domains are multifunctional phosphopeptide binding modules and are the hallmark of the conserved family of rad like checkpoint protein kinases. rad like kinases, including the human tumor suppressor protein chk, play crucial roles in cell cycle arrest and activation of repair processes following dna damage and replication blocks. here we show that ectopic expression of the n terminal fha domain (fha) of the yeast rad kinase causes a growth defect by arresting the cell cycle in g(). this phenotype was highly specific for the rad fha domain and not observed with the similar rad fha, dun fha, and chk fha domains, and it was abrogated by mutations that abolished binding to a phosphothreonine containing peptide in vitro. furthermore, replacement of the rad gene with alleles containing amino acid substitutions in the fha domain resulted in an increased dna damage sensitivity in vivo. taken together, these data demonstrate that the fha domain contributes to the checkpoint function of rad, possibly by associating with a phosphorylated target protein in response to dna damage in g().
