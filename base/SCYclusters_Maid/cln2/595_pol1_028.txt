the yeast dna polymerase primase complex. genes and proteins.. . the yeast dna polymerase primase complex is composed of four polypeptides designated p, p, p and p. all the genes coding for these polypeptides have now been cloned. by protein sequence comparison we found that yeast dna polymerase i (alpha) shares three major regions of homology with several dna polymerases. a fourth region, called region p, is conserved in yeast and human dna polymerase alpha. the site of a temperature sensitive mutation in the pol gene which causes decreased stability of the polymerase primase complex has been sequenced and falls in this region. we hypothesize that region p is important for protein protein interactions. highly selective biochemical methods might be similarly important to distinguish functional domains in the polymerase primase complex. an autocatalytic affinity labeling procedure has been applied to map the active center of yeast dna primase. from this approach we conclude that both primase subunits (p and p) participate in the formation of the catalytic site of the enzyme.
