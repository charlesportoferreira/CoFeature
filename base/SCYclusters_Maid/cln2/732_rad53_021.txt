pie, a protein interacting with mec, controls cell growth and checkpoint responses in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in eukaryotes, the atm and atr family proteins play a critical role in the dna damage and replication checkpoint controls. these proteins are characterized by a kinase domain related to the phosphatidylinositol kinase, but they have the ability to phosphorylate proteins. in budding yeast, the atr family protein mec/esr is essential for checkpoint responses and cell growth. we have isolated the pie gene in a two hybrid screen for proteins that interact with mec, and we show that pie interacts physically with mec in vivo. like mec, pie is essential for cell growth, and deletion of the pie gene causes defects in the dna damage and replication block checkpoints similar to those observed in mecdelta mutants. rad hyperphosphorylation following dna damage and replication block is also decreased in piedelta cells, as in mecdelta cells. pie has a limited homology to fission yeast rad, which forms a complex with the atr family protein rad. mutation of the region in pie homologous to rad results in a phenotype similar to that of the piedelta mutation. mec protein kinase activity appears to be essential for checkpoint responses and cell growth. however, mec kinase activity is unaffected by the piedelta mutation, suggesting that pie regulates some essential function other than mec kinase activity. thus, pie is structurally and functionally related to rad and interacts with mec to control checkpoints and cell proliferation.
