differential effects of the mismatch repair genes msh and msh on homeologous recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the products of the yeast mismatch repair genes msh and msh participate in the inhibition of genetic recombination between homeologous (divergent) dna sequences. in strains deficient for these genes, homeologous recombination rates between repeated elements are elevated due to the loss of this inhibition. in this study, the effects of these mutations were further analyzed by quantitation of mitotic homeologous recombinants as crossovers, gene conversions or exceptional events in wild type, msh, msh and msh msh mutant strains. when homeologous sequences were present as a direct repeat in one orientation, crossovers and gene conversions were elevated in msh, msh and msh msh strains. the increases were greater in the msh msh double mutant than in either single mutant. when the order of the homeologous sequences was reversed, the msh mutation again yielded increased rates of crossovers and gene conversions. however, in an msh strain, gene conversions occurred at higher levels but interchromosomal crossovers were not increased and intrachromosomal crossovers were reduced relative to wild type. the msh msh double mutant behaved like the msh single mutant in this orientation. control strains harboring homologous duplications were largely but not entirely unaffected in mutant strains, suggesting specificity for the mismatched intermediates of homeologous recombination. in all strains, very few (&lt; %) recombinants could be attributed to exceptional events. these results suggest that msh and msh can function differentially to control homeologous exchanges.
