identification of a novel mitogen activated protein kinase kinase activation domain recognized by the inhibitor pd .. . utilizing a genetic screen in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified a novel autoactivation region in mammalian mek that is involved in binding the specific mek inhibitor, pd . the genetic screen is possible due to the homology between components of the yeast pheromone response pathway and the eukaryotic raf mek erk signaling cascade. using the fus.his reporter as a functional readout for activation of a reconstituted raf mek erk signaling cascade, randomly mutagenized mek variants that were insensitive to pd were obtained. seven single base change mutations were identified, five of which mapped to kinase subdomains iii and iv of mek. of the seven variants, only one, a leucine to proline substitution at amino acid (leupro), was completely insensitive to pd in vitro (% inhibitory concentration &gt; micro m). however, all seven mutants displayed strikingly high basal activity compared to wild type mek. overexpression of the mek variants in hekt cells resulted in an increase in mitogen activated protein (map) kinase phosphorylation, a finding consistent with the elevated basal activity of these constructs. further, treatment with pd failed to inhibit leupro stimulated map kinase activation in hekt cells, whereas all other variants had some reduction in phospho map kinase levels. by using cyclic amp dependent protein kinase (cdk) as a template, an mek homology model was generated, with five of the seven identified residues clustered together, forming a potential hydrophobic binding pocket for pd . additionally, the model allowed identification of other potential residues that would interact with the inhibitor. directed mutation of these residues supported this region's involvement with inhibitor binding.
