the est protein is a subunit of yeast telomerase.. . est, est, est and tlc function in a single pathway for telomere replication in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae [] [], as would be expected if these genes all encode components of the same complex. estp, the reverse transcriptase protein subunit, and tlc, the templating rna, are subunits of the catalytic core of yeast telomerase [] [] []. in contrast, mutations in est, est or cdc eliminate telomere replication in vivo [] [] [] [] but are dispensable for in vitro telomerase catalytic activity [] []. estp and cdcp, as components of telomerase and telomeric chromatin, respectively, cooperate to recruit telomerase to the end of the chromosome [] []. however, estp has not yet been biochemically characterized and thus its specific role in telomere replication is unclear. we show here that estp is a stable component of the telomerase holoenzyme and furthermore, association of estp with the enzyme requires an intact catalytic core. as predicted for a telomerase subunit, fusion of estp to the high affinity cdcp telomeric dna binding domain greatly increases access of telomerase to the telomere. estp is also tightly associated with telomerase; however, estp is capable of forming a stable tlc containing complex even in the absence of estp or estp. yeast telomerase therefore contains a minimum of three est proteins for which there is both in vivo and in vitro evidence for their role in telomere replication as subunits of the telomerase complex.
