uracil dna glycosylase deficient yeast exhibit a mitochondrial mutator phenotype.. . mutations in mitochondrial dna (mtdna) have been reported in cancer and are involved in the pathogenesis of many mitochondrial diseases. uracil dna glycosylase, encoded by the ung gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae, repairs uracil in dna formed due to deamination of cytosine. our study demonstrates that inactivation of the ung gene leads to at least a fold increased frequency of mutations in mtdna compared with the wild type. using a ungp green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion construct, we demonstrate that yeast yung gfp protein localizes to both mitochondria and the nucleus, indicating that ungp must contain both a mitochondrial localization signal (mls) and a nuclear localization signal. our study reveals that the first amino acids at the n terminus contain the yungp mls. deletion of amino acids resulted in the yungp gfp fusion protein being transported to the nucleus. we also investigated the intracellular localization of human hungp gfp in yeast. our data indicate that hungp gfp predominantly localizes to the mitochondria. further analysis identified the n terminal amino acids as important for localization of hung protein into the mitochondria. expression of both yeast and human ung cdna suppressed the frequency of mitochondrial mutation in ung deficient cells. however, expression of yung in wild type cells increased the frequency of mutations in mtdna, suggesting that elevated expression of ungp is mutagenic. an increase in the frequency of mitochondrial mutants was also observed when hung site directed mutants (yc and ys) were expressed in mitochondria. our study suggests that deamination of cytosine is a frequent event in s.cerevisiae mitochondria and both yeast and human ungp repairs deaminated cytosine in mitochondria.
