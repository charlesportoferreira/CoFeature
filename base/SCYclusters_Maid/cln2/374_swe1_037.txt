effect of ethanol on cell growth of budding yeast. genes that are important for cell growth in the presence of ethanol.. . the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used in the fermentation of various kinds of alcoholic beverages. but the effect of ethanol on the cell growth of this yeast is poorly understood. this study shows that the addition of ethanol causes a cell cycle delay associated with a transient dispersion of f actin cytoskeleton, resulting in an increase in cell size. we found that the tyrosine kinase swe, the negative regulator of cdc clb kinase, is related to the regulation of cell growth in the presence of ethanol. indeed, the increase in cell size due to ethanol was partially abolished in the swe deleted cells, and the amount of swe protein increased transiently in the presence of ethanol. these results indicated that swe is involved in cell size control in the presence of ethanol, and that a signal produced by ethanol causes a transient up regulation of swe. further we investigated comprehensively the ethanol sensitive strains in the complete set of non essential gene deletions and identified at least genes that are important for cell growth in the presence of ethanol.
