control of swep degradation by the morphogenesis checkpoint.. . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, a cell cycle checkpoint coordinates mitosis with bud formation. perturbations that transiently depolarize the actin cytoskeleton cause delays in bud formation, and a 'morphogenesis checkpoint' detects the actin perturbation and imposes a g delay through inhibition of the cyclin dependent kinase, cdcp. the tyrosine kinase swep, homologous to wee in fission yeast, is required for the checkpoint mediated g delay. in this report, we show that swep stability is regulated both during the normal cell cycle and in response to the checkpoint. swep is stable during g and accumulates to a peak at the end of s phase or in early g, when it becomes unstable and is degraded rapidly. destabilization of swep in g and m phase depends on the activity of cdcp in complexes with b type cyclins. several different perturbations of actin organization all prevent swep degradation, leading to the persistence or further accumulation of swep, and cell cycle delay in g.
