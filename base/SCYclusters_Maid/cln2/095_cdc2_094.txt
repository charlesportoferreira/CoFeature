mutation of a conserved cdk site converts a metazoan elongation factor bbeta subunit into a replacement for yeast eefbalpha.. . elongation factor subunit eefbbeta (formerly ef beta in plants and ef delta in animals) was identified and cloned in a screen for proteins from pea that interact with a cyclin dependent kinase (cdk). cdks are enzymes that regulate progression through meiotic and mitotic cell cycles in eukaryotes. eefbbeta and the related protein eefbalpha (formerly ef beta' in plants and ef beta in animals and fungi) can catalyze gtp/gdp exchange on the g protein eefa (formerly ef alpha in plants, animals and fungi) during the elongation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotes. recombinant cdc and its native homologues from pea extracts associated both in vitro and in vivo with eefbbeta. a cdc cyclin b complex phosphorylated recombinant plant eefbbetas, but not eefbalpha. these interactions between cdk and eefbbeta prompted investigations into the in vivo consequences of this relationship. expression of cdnas encoding rice or pea eefbbeta subunits failed to complement a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deleted for the eefbalpha gene, as was previously observed for the human eefbbeta. however, replacement of thr, the sole consensus cdk phosphorylation site in pea eefbbeta, with alanine allowed the pea protein to substitute for eefbalpha function in vivo. in addition, this rescued strain was severely cold sensitive, and more sensitive to translational inhibitors than wild type yeast. taken together, these results suggest a physiological connection between the cyclin dependent class of kinases and a translational elongation factor in mitotic cells, and provide the first in vivo evidence that an altered form of eefbbeta can serve as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eefa.
