characterization of the pol gene product from schizosaccharomyces pombe indicates inter species conservation of the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase delta.. . the schizosaccharomyces pombe pol gene was isolated by sequence homology with a region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae pol gene, the only gene sequenced to date encoding the catalytic subunit of eukaryotic dna polymerase delta. the fission yeast pol gene contains a base pair (bp) intron and encodes a bp transcript the ' end of which is located bp upstream from the initiation codon. the polypeptides predicted from budding and fission yeast pol genes share % of conserved amino acid residues and have a % identical central region. this structural conservation of the catalytic subunit of dna polymerases delta is probably related to functional constraints. a portion of the most conserved region was used to raise antibodies against an s. pombe polymerase delta/beta galactosidase fusion protein expressed in escherichia coli. the purified antibodies recognized a , da protein in s. pombe wild type cell extracts and inhibited an aphidicolin sensitive dna polymerase activity that was distinct from dna polymerase alpha. the antibodies also detected a , da protein in extracts from different proliferating mammalian cells, indicating that the catalytic subunits of dna polymerase delta are highly conserved between yeast and higher eukaryotes.
