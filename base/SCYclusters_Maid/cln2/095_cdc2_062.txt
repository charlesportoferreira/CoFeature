cloning and sequencing of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae sec gene localized on chromosome iv.. . the sec gene of yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned by complementing the temperature sensitive mutation of sec at degrees c, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. sec is a single copy gene and encodes a protein of amino acids and , daltons with a predicted pi value of .. hydrophobicity plotting showed no clearly hydrophobic regions suggesting a soluble nature for the protein. amino acid sequence comparisons revealed no obvious homologies with the proteins in the swissprot databank. two consensus sequence for the cdc encoded protein kinase recognition site were revealed within secp. the codon usage suggests a low expression level for sec. the ' non translated region contains two tata like sequences at and nucleotides from the translation start site. two potential regulatory sequences for dna binding proteins were found in the non coding ' region. a hap/hap consensus recognition sequence at nucleotide and a baf consensus recognition sequence at nucleotide . the sec specific probe detected a nucleotides long transcript, which was in reasonable agreement with the nucleotides long open reading frame.
