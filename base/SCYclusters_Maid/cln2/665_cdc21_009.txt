isolation of the thymidylate synthetase gene (tmp) by complementation in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the structural gene (tmp) for yeast thymidylate synthetase (thymidylate synthase; ec ...) was isolated from a chimeric plasmid bank by genetic complementation in saccharomyces cerevisiae. retransformation of the dtmp auxotroph gy and a temperature sensitive mutant (cdc) with purified plasmid (ptl) yielded tmp+ transformants at high frequency. in addition, the plasmid was tested for the ability to complement a bacterial thya mutant that lacks functional thymidylate synthetase. although it was not possible to select thy+ transformants directly, it was found that all ptl transformants were phenotypically thy+ after several generations of growth in nonselective conditions. thus, yeast thymidylate synthetase is biologically active in escherichia coli. thymidylate synthetase was assayed in yeast cell lysates by high pressure liquid chromatography to monitor the conversion of [ h]dump to [ h]dtmp. in protein extracts from the thymidylate auxotroph (tmp ) enzymatic conversion of dump to dtmp was barely detectable. lysates of ptl transformants of this strain, however, had thymidylate synthetase activity that was comparable to that of the wild type strain.
