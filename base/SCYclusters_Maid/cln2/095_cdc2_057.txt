proteolytic processing of ty proteins is required for transposition.. . ty is a retroviruslike element found in saccharomyces cerevisiae. it encodes gag and gag pol polyproteins which are processed into mature proteins found in the ty viruslike particle. in this study, the region encoding a protease that is homologous to retroviral aspartyl proteases was identified and shown to be required for production of mature ty proteins and transposition. the ty protease has the asp ser gly consensus sequence found in copia, ty, and rous sarcoma virus proteases, rather than the asp thr gly found in most retroviral proteases. the asp ser gly consensus is flanked by residues similar to those which flank the active sites of cellular aspartyl proteases. mutations were made in the ty active site sequence to examine the role of the protease in ty particle maturation and to test the functional significance of the ser active site variant in the consensus sequence. mutation of the active site asp blocked processing of gag and gag pol and allowed identification of a gag pol polyprotein. this protein was turned over rapidly in cells expressing the mutant ty. changing the active site ser to thr caused only a modest reduction in the levels of certain ty proteins. five putative cleavage sites of this protease in ty gag and gag pol polyproteins were defined by amino terminal sequence analysis. the existence of an additional protein(s) of unknown function, encoded downstream of the protease coding region, was deduced from the positions of these amino termini and the sizes of known ty proteins. although ty protease cleavage sites do not correspond exactly to known retroviral protease cleavage sites, there are similarities. residues p through p' in the regions encompassing each of the five sites are uncharged, and no p position is occupied by an amino acid with a branched beta carbon.
