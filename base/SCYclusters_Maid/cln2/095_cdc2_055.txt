a random mutagenesis procedure. application to the pol gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . to obtain a broad spectrum of mutations in the pol gene, we have developed an efficient random mutagenesis procedure. partially extended, primed, single stranded templates were used for forced misincorporation of non complementary nucleotides, extended to completion and ligated. linear fragments of the resulting amplified mutagenized library were then used to transform a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain by the marker replacement technique. this procedure has proven to be very efficient when applied to the c terminal moiety of pol, yielding temperature sensitive mutants and six extragenic revertants.
