clb/cdc and cdc regulate phosphorylation status and cellular localization of swi.. . nuclear export of the transcription factor swi during the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle is known to require phosphorylation of the swi serine residue. we show that clb/cdc kinase is required for this nuclear export. furthermore, cdc combined with the s phase cyclin clb specifically phosphorylates serine of swi in vitro. nuclear import of swi occurs concomitantly with dephosphorylation of serine in late m phase. we show that cdc phosphatase, the principal effector of the mitotic exit network, can trigger nuclear import of swi in vivo and that cdc dephosphorylates swi at serine in vitro. taken together, these observations show how swi dephosphorylation and phosphorylation are integrated into changes of cdc activity governing entry and exit from the g phase of the cell cycle.
