remodelling the rad checkpoint complex. preparing rad for action.. . dna damage checkpoints are signal transduction pathways that are activated after genotoxic insults to protect genomic integrity. the rad protein functions in the dna damage checkpoint pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae and is essential for the mec dependent activation of the effector kinase rad. we recently described the purification of two soluble distinct rad complexes. the large kda complex consists of hypophosphorylated rad and the chaperone proteins ssa/. this complex is found both in undamaged cells as well as in cells treated with dna damaging agents. the smaller kda complex contains hyperphosphorylated rad, ssa/ and, in addition, rad. this complex forms only in cells with compromised dna integrity. once bound to the smaller complex, rad can be activated by in trans autophosphorylation. here, we propose a model in which the large rad complex is remodelled after a genomic insult by chaperone activity to a smaller rad activating complex.
