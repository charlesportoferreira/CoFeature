intracellular trafficking of yeast telomerase components.. . telomerase uses an internal rna moiety as template for the synthesis of telomere repeats. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomerase holoenzyme contains the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit estp, the telomerase rna moiety tlc, the telomerase associated proteins estp and estp, and sm proteins. here we assess telomerase assembly by determining the localization of telomerase components. we found that estp, estp and tlc can migrate independently of each other to the nucleus. with limiting amounts of tlc, overexpressed estp and estp accumulated in the nucleolus, whereas enzymatically active estp tlc complexes are distributed over the entire nucleus. the distribution to the nucleoplasm depended on the specific interaction between estp and tlc but was independent of estp and estp. altogether, our results suggest a role of the nucleolus in telomerase biogenesis. we also describe experiments that support a transient cytoplasmic localization of tlc rna.
