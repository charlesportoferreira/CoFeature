sequence of a . kb segment of yeast chromosome xi identifies the apn and the baf loci and reveals one trna gene and several new open reading frames including homologs to rad and kinases.. . we report here the dna sequence of a segment of chromosome xi of saccharomyces cerevisiae extending over . kb. the sequence was determined using a double strand sequencing strategy adapted from the random clone strategy. the segment contains seven non overlapping long open reading frames, ykl, , , , , and and one trna gene. ykl and ykl are two already sequenced genes, the baf/abf and the apn genes, respectively. ykl exhibits a strong homology to the rad protein and ykl is presumably a protein kinase.
