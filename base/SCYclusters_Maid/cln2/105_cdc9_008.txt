cell cycle regulation of a dna ligase encoding gene (calig) from candida albicans.. . a dna ligase (calig) (formerly cacdc) of the human pathogen, candida albicans, has been characterized. the encoded protein displayed a significant similarity to ligase iv from both saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans. in addition, whereas calig did not complement a s. cerevisiae cdc mutant, it re established non homologous end joining of dna double strand breaks in a s. cerevisiae lig deletant. calig was assigned to chromosome . several cis acting effector sequences were identified in the promoter region of the calig, including the dna sequence element acgng, which is required for periodic transcription of several dna replicating genes in s. cerevisiae. the level of transcription of calig in c. albicans varies during the yeast cell cycle. newly formed cells contained basal levels of transcript which increased to a maximum level when cells were in late g(). thereafter, levels of transcript dropped as dna replication was initiated. our results suggest that calig may perform an important role during the mitotic cycle of c. albicans. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
