formamide sensitivity. a novel conditional phenotype in yeast.. . yeast mutants unable to grow in the presence of % formamide have been isolated in parallel with mutants sensitive to either degrees or % ethanol. the number of formamide sensitive mutations that affect different genes that can be identified from yeast cells is at least as large as the number of thermosensitive or ethanol sensitive mutations. these mutations are of two types. those that are sensitive to formamide, temperature and/or ethanol simultaneously; and those that are specific for formamide sensitivity and show no temperature or ethanol sensitivity phenotype. those genes susceptible to giving rise to formamide sensitive alleles include the structural gene for dna ligase, cdc, and the structural gene for arginine permease, can. the results indicate that formamide sensitivity can be used as a novel conditional phenotype for mutations on both essential and nonessential genes. this work also confirms that ethanol sensitivity can be used as a conditional phenotype to identify mutations in at least as many genes as those susceptible to temperature or formamide sensitive mutations.
