functional characterization of two flap endonuclease homologues in rice.. . flap endonuclease (fen ) is an important enzyme involved in dna replication and repair. previously, we isolated and characterized a complementary dna (cdna) from rice (oryza sativa) encoding a protein which shows homology with the eukaryotic flap endonuclease (fen ). in this report, we found that rice (o. sativa l. cv. nipponbare) possessed two fen homologues designated as osfen a and osfen b. the osfen a and osfen b genes were mapped to chromosome and , respectively. both genes contained exons and introns. alignment of osfen a protein with osfen b protein showed a high degree of sequence similarity, particularly around the n and i domains. northern hybridization and in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated preferential expression of osfen a and osfen b in proliferating tissues such as the shoot apical meristem or young leaves. the levels of osfen a and osfen b expression were significantly reduced when cell proliferation was temporarily halted by the removal of sucrose from the growth medium. when the growth halted cells began to regrow following the addition of sucrose to the medium, both osfen a and osfen b were again expressed at high level. these results suggested that osfen a and osfen b are required for cell proliferation. functional complementation assay suggested that osfen a cdna had the ability to complement saccharomyces cerevisiae rad null mutant. on the other hand, osfen b cdna could not complement the rad mutant. the roles of osfen a and osfen b in plant dna replication and repair are discussed.
