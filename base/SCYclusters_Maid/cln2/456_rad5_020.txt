analysis of mutagenic dna repair in a thermoconditional mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae. iv. influence of dna replication and excision repair on rev dependent uv mutagenesis and repair.. . a double mutant being thermoconditionally defective in mutation induction as well as in repair of pre lethal uv induced dna damage (revts) and deficient in excision repair (rad ) was studied in temperature shift experiments. the influence of inhibitors of dna replication (hydroxyurea, aphidicolin) was determined. additionally, an analysis of the dose response pattern of mutation induction (&quot;mutation kinetics&quot;) at several ochre alleles was carried out. it was concluded that the uv inducible rev dependent mutagenic repair process is not induced in excision deficient cells. in excision deficient cells, rev dependent mutation fixation is slow and mostly post replicative though not dependent on dna replication. the rev mediated mutagenic process could be separated from the repair function.
