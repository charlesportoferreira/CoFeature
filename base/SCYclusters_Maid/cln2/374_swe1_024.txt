coupling of mitosis to the completion of s phase through cdc mediated degradation of wee.. . the dependence of mitosis on the completion of the period of dna replication in the cell cycle [synthesis (s) phase] ensures that chromosome segregation occurs only after the genome has been fully duplicated. a key negative regulator of mitosis, the protein kinase wee, was degraded in a cdc dependent fashion in xenopus egg extracts. this proteolysis event was required for a timely entrance into mitosis and was inhibited when dna replication was blocked. therefore, the dna replication checkpoint can prevent mitosis by suppressing the proteolysis of wee during s phase.
