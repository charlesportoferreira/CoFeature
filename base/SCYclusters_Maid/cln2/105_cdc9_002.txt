mitochondrial dna ligase function in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc gene encodes a dna ligase protein that is targeted to both the nucleus and the mitochondria. while nuclear cdcp is known to play an essential role in nuclear dna replication and repair, its role in mitochondrial dna dynamics has not been defined. it is also unclear whether additional dna ligase proteins are present in yeast mitochondria. to address these issues, mitochondrial dna ligase function in s.cerevisiae was analyzed. biochemical analysis of mitochondrial protein extracts supported the conclusion that cdcp was the sole dna ligase protein present in this organelle. inactivation of mitochondrial cdcp function led to a rapid decline in cellular mitochondrial dna content in both dividing and stationary yeast cultures. in contrast, there was no apparent defect in mitochondrial dna dynamics in a yeast strain deficient in dnlp (deltadnl). the escherichia coli eco.ri endonuclease was targeted to yeast mitochondria. transient expression of this recombinant eco.ri endonuclease led to the formation of mitochondrial dna double strand breaks. while wild type and deltadnl yeast were able to rapidly recover from this mitochondrial dna damage, clones deficient in mitochondrial cdcp were not. these results support the conclusion that yeast rely upon a single dna ligase, cdcp, to carry out mitochondrial dna replication and recovery from both spontaneous and induced mitochondrial dna damage.
