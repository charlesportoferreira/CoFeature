a genome wide transcriptional analysis of the mitotic cell cycle.. . progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle is known to be both regulated and accompanied by periodic fluctuation in the expression levels of numerous genes. we report here the genome wide characterization of mrna transcript levels during the cell cycle of the budding yeast s. cerevisiae. cell cycle dependent periodicity was found for of the monitored transcripts. more than % of the genes were found directly adjacent to other genes in the genome that displayed induction in the same cell cycle phase, suggesting a mechanism for local chromosomal organization in global mrna regulation. more than % of the characterized genes that displayed mrna fluctuation have already been implicated in cell cycle period specific biological roles. because more than % of human proteins display significant homology to yeast proteins, these results also link a range of human genes to cell cycle period specific biological functions.
