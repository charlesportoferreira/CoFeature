two ring finger proteins mediate cooperation between ubiquitin conjugating enzymes in dna repair.. . two ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, rad and the heteromeric ubc mms complex, have been implicated in post replicative dna damage repair in yeast. here we provide a mechanistic basis for cooperation between the two enzymes. we show that two chromatin associated ring finger proteins, rad and rad, play a central role in mediating physical contacts between the members of the rad pathway. rad recruits the ubc mms complex to dna by means of its ring finger domain. moreover, rad association with rad brings ubc mms into contact with the rad rad complex. interaction between the two ring finger proteins thus promotes the formation of a heteromeric complex in which the two distinct ubiquitin conjugating activities of rad and ubc mms can be closely coordinated. surprisingly, ubc and mms are largely cytosolic proteins, but dna damage triggers their redistribution to the nucleus. these findings suggest a mechanism by which the activity of this dna repair pathway could be regulated.
