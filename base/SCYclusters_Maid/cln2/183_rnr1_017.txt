overexpression of the rnr gene rescues saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants in the mitochondrial dna polymerase encoding mip gene.. . a multicopy suppressor gene which rescues the temperature sensitive growth defect of saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants in the mitochondrial dna (mtdna) polymerase encoding mip gene has been isolated and identified as the rnr gene. this gene, whose transcript is cell cycle regulated and mainly expressed at the g to s phase transition, encodes the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. this enzyme catalyses a limiting step in the production of deoxynucleotides needed for dna synthesis. the presence of a high copy number of the rnr gene also decreases the accumulation of rho mutants observed in diploids that harbour a single copy of the mip gene. in cell cycle synchronised cells, the presence of a high copy number of rnr does not modify its cell cycle transcription regulation and increases its transcript level by a factor of throughout the cell cycle. our results show that an increased supply of dntps in mitochondria can stimulate the mtdna polymerase activity and indicate that the dntp concentration may be rate limiting for the replication of mtdna.
