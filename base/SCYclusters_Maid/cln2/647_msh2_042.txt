mutations of a muts homolog in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.. . recent studies have shown that a locus responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) is on chromosome p and that tumors developing in these patients contain alterations in microsatellite sequences (rer+ phenotype). we have used chromosome microdissection to obtain highly polymorphic markers from chromosome p. these and other markers were ordered in a panel of somatic cell hybrids and used to define a . mb interval containing the hnpcc locus. candidate genes were then mapped, and one was found to lie within the . mb interval. we identified this candidate by virtue of its homology to muts mismatch repair genes. cdna clones were obtained and the sequence used to detect germline mutations, including those producing termination codons, in hnpcc kindreds. somatic as well as germline mutations of the gene were identified in rer+ tumor cells. this muts homolog is therefore likely to be responsible for hnpcc.
