mec dependent phosphorylation of radp in response to dna damage.. . in budding yeast, dna damage can activate a checkpoint surveillance system controlled by the rad, rad, and mec genes, resulting in a delay in cell cycle progression. here, i report that dna damage induces rapid and extensive phosphorylation of radp in a manner that correlates directly with checkpoint activation. this response is dependent on mec, which encodes a member of the evolutionarily conserved atm family of protein kinases, and on gene products of the rad epistasis group, which have been implicated in the recognition and processing of dna lesions. since the phosphorylated form of radp appears capable of interacting stably with radp in vivo, this phosphorylation response likely controls checkpoint signaling by radp.
