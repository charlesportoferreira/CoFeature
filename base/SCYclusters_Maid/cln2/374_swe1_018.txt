binding of beta to the carboxyl terminus of wee increases wee stability, kinase activity, and g m cell population.. . wee protein kinase plays an important regulatory role in cell cycle progression. it inhibits cdc activity by phosphorylating tyr and arrests cells at g m phase. in an attempt to understand wee regulation during cell cycle, yeast two hybrid screening was used to identify wee binding protein(s). five of the eight positive clones identified encode beta. in vivo binding assay in cells showed that both full length and nh terminal truncated wee bind with beta. the beta binding site was mapped to a cooh terminal consensus motif, rsvslt (codons to ). binding with beta increases the protein level of full length wee but not of the truncated wee. accompanying the protein level increases, the kinase activity of wee also increases when coexpressed with beta. increased wee protein level/enzymatic activity is accountable, at least in part, to an increased wee protein half life when coexpressed with beta. the protein half life of the nh terminal truncated wee is much longer than that of the full length protein and is not affected by beta cotransfection. biologically, beta/wee coexpression increases the cell population at g m phase. thus, wee binding with beta increases its biochemical activity as well as its biological function. the finding reveals a novel mechanism by which regulates g m arrest and suggests that the nh terminal domain of wee contains a negative regulatory sequence that determines wee stability.
