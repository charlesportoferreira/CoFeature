n terminal domain of yeast telomerase reverse transcriptase. recruitment of estp to the telomerase complex.. . telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that maintains chromosome ends. the n terminal half of the catalytic protein subunit (tert) contains three functional domains (i, ii, and iii) that are conserved among terts but not found in other reverse transcriptases. guided by an amino acid sequence alignment of nine tert proteins, mutations were introduced into yeast tert (estp). in support of the proposed alignment, mutation of virtually all conserved residues resulted in loss of function or temperature sensitivity, accompanied by telomere shortening. overexpression of telomerase component estp led to allele specific suppression of the temperature sensitive mutations in region i, suggesting that estp interacts with this protein domain. as predicted by the genetic results, a lethal mutation in region i resulted in loss of estp from the telomerase complex. we conclude that estp region i is required for the recruitment of estp to yeast telomerase. given the phylogenetic conservation of region i of tert, this protein domain may provide the equivalent function in all telomerases.
