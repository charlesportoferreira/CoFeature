enhanced expression of the dna damage inducible gene din results in increased mutagenesis of mitochondrial dna in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we reported previously that the product of din, a dna damage inducible gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae, belongs to the xpg family of proteins, which are involved in dna repair and replication. this family includes the s. cerevisiae protein radp and its human homolog xpgc, radp and its mammalian homolog fen , and exonuclease i (exo i). interestingly, dinp is the only member of the xpg family which specifically functions in mitochondria. we reported previously that overexpression of din results in a mitochondrial mutator phenotype. in the present study we wished to test the hypothesis that this phenotype is dependent on the nuclease activity of dinp. for this purpose, we constructed two alleles, din da and din da, which encode proteins in which highly conserved aspartates important for the nuclease activity of the xpg proteins have been replaced by alanines. here, we report that overexpression of the mutant alleles, in contrast to din, fails to increase the frequency of mitochondrial petite mutants or erythromycin resistant (er) mutants. also, overproduction of din dap does not result in destabilization of poly gt tracts in mitochondrial dna (mtdna), the phenotype observed in cells that overexpress dinp. we also show that petite mutants induced by enhanced synthesis of wild type dinp exhibit gross rearrangements of mtdna, and that this correlates with enhanced recombination within the mitochondrial cyt b gene. these results suggest that the stability of the mitochondrial genome of s. cerevisiae is modulated by the level of the nuclease dinp.
