a yeast replicative helicase, dna helicase, interacts with yeast fen nuclease in carrying out its essential function.. . we have recently described a new helicase, the dna helicase, that is essential for yeast dna replication. we now show that the yeast fen (yfen ) nuclease interacts genetically and biochemically with dna helicase. fen is implicated in dna replication and repair in yeast, and the mammalian homolog of yfen (dnase iv, fen , or mf) participates in okazaki fragment maturation. overproduction of yfen , encoded by rad/rth, suppresses the temperature sensitive growth of dna mutants. overproduction of dna suppresses the rad/rth delta temperature sensitive growth defect. dna rad/rth delta double mutants are inviable, indicating that the mutations are synthetically lethal. the genetic interactions are likely due to direct physical interaction between the two proteins, since both epitope tagged yfen and endogenous yfen coimmunopurify with tagged dna. the simplest interpretation of these data is that one of the roles of dna helicase is associated with processing of okazaki fragments.
