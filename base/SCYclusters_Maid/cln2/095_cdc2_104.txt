hira, the human homologue of yeast hirp and hirp, is a novel cyclin cdk substrate whose expression blocks s phase progression.. . substrates of cyclin cdk kinases contain two distinct primary sequence motifs. a cyclin binding rxl motif and one or more phosphoacceptor sites (consensus s/tpxk/r or s/tp). to identify novel cyclin cdk substrates, we searched the database for proteins containing both of these motifs. one such protein is human hira, the homologue of two cell cycle regulated repressors of histone gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hirp and hirp. here we demonstrate that human hira is an in vivo substrate of a cyclin cdk kinase. first, hira bound to and was phosphorylated by cyclin a and e cdk in vitro in an rxl dependent manner. second, hira was phosphorylated in vivo on two consensus cyclin cdk phosphoacceptor sites and at least one of these, threonine , was phosphorylated by cyclin a cdk in vitro. third, phosphorylation of hira in vivo was blocked by cyclin cdk inhibitor p(cip). fourth, hira became phosphorylated on threonine in s phase when cyclin cdk kinases are active. fifth, hira was localized preferentially to the nucleus, where active cyclin a and e cdk are located. finally, ectopic expression of hira in cells caused arrest in s phase and this is consistent with the notion that it is a cyclin cdk substrate that has a role in control of the cell cycle.
