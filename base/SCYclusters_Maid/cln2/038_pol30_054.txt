requirement of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in rad dependent postreplicational dna repair.. . the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) acts as a processivity factor for replicative dna polymerases and is essential for dna replication. in vitro studies have suggested a role for pcna in the repair synthesis step of nucleotide excision repair, and pcna interacts with the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p. however, because of the lack of genetic evidence, it is not clear which of the dna repair processes are in fact affected by pcna in vivo. here, we describe a pcna mutation, pol , that confers ultraviolet (uv) sensitivity but has no effect on growth or cell cycle progression, and the mutant pcna interacts normally with dna polymerase delta and epsilon. genetic studies indicate that the pol mutation is specifically defective in rad dependent postreplicational repair of uv damaged dna, and this mutation impairs the error free mode of bypass repair. these results implicate a role for pcna as an intermediary between dna replication and postreplicational dna repair.
