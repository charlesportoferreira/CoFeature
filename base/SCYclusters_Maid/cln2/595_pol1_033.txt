the composition of the rna polymerase i transcription machinery switches from initiation to elongation mode.. . the amounts of rna polymerase i (pol i) and basal rdna transcription factors were determined in yeast whole cell extracts. a fold excess of pol i was found compared to the pol i specific initiation factors upstream activating factor (uaf) and core factor (cf) which underlines that both initiation factors interact with a minor fraction of pol i when rdna transcription is active. surprisingly, rrnp, another pol i specific initiation factor, is more abundant in cell lysates than uaf and cf. our analyses revealed that a large fraction of cellular rrnp is not associated with pol i. however, the amount of initiation active rrnp which forms a stable complex with pol i corresponds to the levels of uaf and cf which have been shown to bind the promoter. initiation active rrnp dissociates from the template during or immediately after pol i has switched from initiation to elongation. our data support a model in which the elongating pol i leaves the initiation factors uaf, cf and rrnp close by the promoter.
