expansions and contractions in bp minisatellites by gene conversion in yeast.. . the instability of simple tandem repeats, such as human minisatellite loci, has been suggested to arise by gene conversions. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, a double strand break (dsb) was created by the ho endonuclease so that dna polymerases associated with gap repair must traverse an artificial minisatellite of perfect bp repeats or a yeast y' minisatellite containing diverged bp repeats. gene conversions are frequently accompanied by changes in repeat number when the template contains perfect repeats. when the ends of the dsb have nonhomologous tails of and nucleotides that must be removed before repair dna synthesis can begin, % of gene conversions had rearrangements, most of which were contractions, almost always in the recipient locus. when efficient removal of nonhomologous tails was prevented in rad and msh strains, repair was reduced fold, but among survivors there was a fold reduction in contractions. half the remaining events were expansions. a similar decrease in the contraction rate was observed when the template was modified so that dsb ends were homologous to the template; and here, too, half of the remaining rearrangements were expansions. in this case, efficient repair does not require rad and msh, consistent with our previous observations. in addition, without nonhomologous dsb ends, msh and rad mutations did not affect the frequency or the distribution of rearrangements. we conclude that the presence of nonhomologous ends alters the mechanism of dsb repair, likely through early recruitment of repair proteins including mshp and radp, resulting in more frequent contractions of repeated sequences.
