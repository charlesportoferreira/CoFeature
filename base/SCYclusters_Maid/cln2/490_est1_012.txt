the est subunit of saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase makes multiple contributions to telomere length maintenance.. . the telomerase associated est protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae mediates enzyme access by bridging the interaction between the catalytic core of telomerase and the telomere binding protein cdc. in addition to recruiting telomerase, est may act as a positive regulator of telomerase once the enzyme has been brought to the telomere, as previously suggested by the inability of a cdc est fusion protein to promote extensive telomere elongation in an est delta strain. we report here three classes of mutant est proteins that retain association with the telomerase enzyme but confer different in vivo consequences. class mutants display a telomere replication defect but are capable of promoting extensive telomere elongation in the presence of a cdc est fusion protein, consistent with a defect in telomerase recruitment. class mutants fail to elongate telomeres even in the presence of the cdc est fusion, which is the phenotype predicted for a defect in the proposed second regulatory function of est. a third class of mutants impairs an activity of est that is potentially required for the ku mediated pathway of telomere length maintenance. the isolation of mutations that perturb separate functions of est demonstrates that a telomerase holoenzyme subunit can contribute multiple regulatory roles to telomere length maintenance.
