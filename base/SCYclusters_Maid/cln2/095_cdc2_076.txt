mammalian cyclin/pcna (dna polymerase delta auxiliary protein) stimulates processive dna synthesis by yeast dna polymerase iii.. . human cyclin/pcna (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) is structurally, functionally, and immunologically homologous to the calf thymus auxiliary protein for dna polymerase delta. this auxiliary protein has been investigated as a stimulatory factor for the nuclear dna polymerases from s. cerevisiae. calf cyclin/pcna enhances by more than ten fold the ability of dna polymerase iii to replicate templates with high template/primer ratios, e.g. poly(da).oligo(dt) (.). the degree of stimulation increases with the template/primer ratio. at a high template/primer ratio, i.e. low primer density, cyclin/pcna greatly increases processive dna synthesis by dna polymerase iii. at low template/primer ratios (e.g. poly(da).oligo(dt) (..), where addition of cyclin/pcna only minimally increases the processivity of dna polymerase iii, a several fold stimulation of total dna synthesis is still observed. this indicates that cyclin/pcna may also increase productive binding of dna polymerase iii to the template primer and stabilize the template primer polymerase complex. the activity of yeast dna polymerases i and ii is not affected by addition of cyclin/pcna. these results strengthen the hypothesis that yeast dna polymerase iii is functionally analogous to the mammalian dna polymerase delta.
