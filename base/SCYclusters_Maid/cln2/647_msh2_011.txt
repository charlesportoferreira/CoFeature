the saccharomyces cerevisiae msh mismatch repair protein localizes to recombination intermediates in vivo.. . mismatch repair proteins act during double strand break repair (dsbr) to correct mismatches in heteroduplex dna, to suppress recombination between divergent sequences, and to promote removal of nonhomologous dna at dsb ends. we investigated yeast mshp association with recombination intermediates in vivo using chromatin immunoprecipitation. during dsbr involving nonhomologous ends, mshp localized strongly to recipient and donor sequences. localization required mshp and was greatly reduced in raddelta strains. minimal localization of mshp was observed during fully homologous repair, but this was increased in raddelta strains. these findings argue that mshp mshp associates with intermediates early in dsbr to participate in the rejection of homeologous pairing and to stabilize nonhomologous tails for cleavage by radp radp endonuclease.
