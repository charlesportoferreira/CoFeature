the est subunit of yeast telomerase binds the tlc telomerase rna.. . est is a component of yeast telomerase, and est mutants have senescence and telomere loss phenotypes. the exact function of est is not known, and it is not homologous to components of other telomerases. we previously showed that est protein coimmunoprecipitates with tlc (the telomerase rna) as well as with telomerase activity. est has homology to ebs, an uncharacterized yeast open reading frame product, including homology to a putative rna recognition motif (rrm) of ebs. deletion of ebs results in short telomeres. we created point mutations in a putative rrm of est. one mutant was unable to complement either the senescence or the telomere loss phenotype of est mutants. furthermore, the mutant protein no longer coprecipitated with the tlc telomerase rna. mutants defective in the binding of tlc rna were nevertheless capable of binding single stranded tg rich dna. our data suggest that an important role of est in the telomerase complex is to bind to the tlc telomerase rna via an rrm. since est can also bind telomeric dna, est may tether telomerase to the telomere.
