rsr and rap gtpases are activated by the same gtpase activating protein and require threonine for their activation.. . the rsr protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to be essential for bud site selection (bender, a., and pringle, j. () proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. , ). this protein of amino acids shares approximately % sequence identity with both ras and rap gtpases. however, neither gtp binding nor gtpase activity of the rsr protein has been reported. the rsr protein shares with human rap gtpases the four specific motifs, i.e. gly , residues , ala , and residues , that are required for gap dependent activation of the rap gtpases. in this paper we demonstrate that the intrinsic gtpase activity of the rsr protein is stimulated by gap purified from bovine brain cytosol. the rsr gtpase is not activated by either gap or gap which are specific for the ras and rho gtpases, respectively. thus, it appears that the rsr gtpase is a new member of the rap gtpase family. replacement of gly by val in the rsr gtpase completely abolishes the gap dependent activation. the chimeric gtpases, ras( )/rsr( ) and rsr( )/ras( ), are activated by gap but not by gap. replacement of thr by ser in the latter chimeric gtpase completely abolishes the gap dependent activation, indicating that thr is required for distinguishing gap from gap. we have previously shown that gln and ser are sufficient to determine the gap specificity. replacement of thr by ala in the common effector domain (residues ) of the chimeric ras/rsr gtpases completely abolishes gap dependent activation.
