a novel allele of fission yeast rad that causes defects in dna repair and telomere length regulation.. . replication protein a (rpa) is a heterotrimeric single stranded dna binding protein involved in dna replication, recombination and repair. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, several mutants in the rfa gene encoding the large subunit of rpa have been isolated and one of the mutants with a missense allele, rfa dy, shows a synergistic reduction in telomere length when combined with a yku mutation. so far, only one mutant allele of the rad(+) gene encoding the large subunit of rpa has been reported in schizosaccharomyces pombe. to study the role of s.pombe rpa in dna repair and possibly in telomere maintenance, we constructed a rad dy mutant, which corresponds to the s.cerevisiae rfa dy mutant. rad dy cells were methylmethane sulfonate, hydroxyurea, uv and gamma ray sensitive, suggesting that rad dy cells have a defect in dna repair activity. unlike the s.cerevisiae rfa dy mutation, the rad dy mutation itself caused telomere shortening. moreover, rad myc bound to telomere in a chip assay. these results strongly suggest that rpa is directly involved in telomere maintenance.
