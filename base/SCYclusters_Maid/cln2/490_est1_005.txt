functional conservation of the telomerase protein estp in humans.. . eukaryotic telomerase contains a telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) and an rna template component that are essential for telomerase catalytic activity and several other telomerase associated factors of which only a few appear to be integral enzyme components [ ]. the first essential telomerase protein identified was s. cerevisiae estp, whose deletion leads to ever shorter telomeres despite the persistence of telomerase activity [ ]. extensive genetic and biochemical data show that estp, via its interaction with the telomerase rna and telomere end dna binding complex cdcp/stnp/tenp, promotes the ability of telomerase to elongate telomeres in vivo [ ]. the characterization of estp homologs outside of yeast has not been documented. we report the characterization of two putative human homologs of estp, hesta and hestb. both proteins specifically associated with telomerase activity in human cell extracts and bound htert in rabbit reticulocyte lysates independently of the telomerase rna. overproduction of hesta cooperated with htert to lengthen telomeres, an effect that was specific to cells containing telomerase activity. like estp, hesta (but not hestb) exhibited a single stranded telomere dna binding activity. these results suggest that the telomerase associated factor estp is evolutionarily conserved in humans.
