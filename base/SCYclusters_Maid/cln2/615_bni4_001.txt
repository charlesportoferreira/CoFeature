the dna sequence of cosmid from chromosome xiv reveals open reading frames including a novel gene encoding a globin like domain.. . in this paper is described the dna sequence of cosmid from chromosome xiv of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sequence is bases long and contains open reading frames (orfs) plus three internal orfs. six orfs correspond to known yeast genes (sla, zwf, blh, kex, sin and ure); two other orfs had already been sequenced because they are adjacent to known genes; the remaining orfs are novel genes. of these, one orf (nii) is particularly interesting since it shows a significant similarity to mammalian globin. another orf (n) displays two zinc finger motifs as well as a dnaj motif.
