yeast mutants with increased bacterial transposon tn excision.. . five complementing recessive mutations that exhibit increased bacterial transposon tn precise excision in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were obtained by ethylmethanesulfonate treatment. one of these mutations (tex) was submitted to extensive genetic analysis. tex is a recessive temperature sensitive mutation resulting in a fold increase in tn excision. it also has increased frequencies of ochre mutation reversion, of forward mutation to canavanine resistance, and loss of chromosome iii or its right arm. the possible mechanism of tex effects is discussed.
