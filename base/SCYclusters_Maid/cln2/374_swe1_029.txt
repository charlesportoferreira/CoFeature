drosophila wee kinase rescues fission yeast from mitotic catastrophe and phosphorylates drosophila cdc in vitro.. . cdc kinase activity is required for triggering entry into mitosis in all known eukaryotes. elaborate mechanisms have evolved for regulating cdc activity so that mitosis occurs in a timely manner, when preparations for its execution are complete. in schizosaccharomyces pombe, wee and a related mik kinase are cdc inhibitory kinases that are required for preventing premature activation of the mitotic program. to identify cdc inhibitory kinases in drosophila, we screened for cdna clones that rescue s. pombe wee mik mutants from lethal mitotic catastrophe. one of the genes identified in this screen, drosophila wee (dwee), encodes a new wee homologue. dwee kinase is closely related to human and xenopus wee homologues, and can inhibit cdc activity by phosphorylating a critical tyrosine residue. dwee mrna is maternally provided to embryos, and is zygotically expressed during the postblastoderm divisions of embryogenesis. expression remains high in the proliferating cells of the central nervous system well after cells in the rest of the embryo have ceased dividing. the loss of zygotically expressed dwee does not lead to mitotic catastrophe during postblastoderm cycles to . this result may indicate that maternally provided dwee is sufficient for regulating cdc during embryogenesis, or it may reflect the presence of a redundant cdc inhibitory kinase, as in fission yeast.
