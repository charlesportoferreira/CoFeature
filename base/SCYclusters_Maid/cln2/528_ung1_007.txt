the spectrum of spontaneous mutations in a saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil dna glycosylase mutant limits the function of this enzyme to cytosine deamination repair.. . uracil dna glycosylase has been proposed to function as the first enzyme in strand directed mismatch repair in eukaryotic organisms, through removal of uracil from dump residues periodically inserted into the dna during dna replication (aprelikova, o. n., v. m. golubovskaya, t. a. kusmin, and n. v. tomilin, mutat. res. . , ). this hypothesis was investigated with saccharomyces cerevisiae. mutation frequencies and spectra were determined for an ung deletion strain in the target sup o trna gene by using a forward selection scheme. mutation frequencies in the sup o gene increased about fold relative to an isogenic wild type s. cerevisiae strain, and the mutator effect was completely suppressed in the ung deletion strain carrying the wild type ung gene on a multicopy plasmid. sixty nine independently derived mutations in the sup o gene were sequenced. all but five of these were due to gc at transitions. from this analysis, we conclude that the mutator phenotype of the ung deletion strain is the result of a failure to repair spontaneous cytosine deamination events occurring frequently in s. cerevisiae and that the ung gene is not required for strand specific mismatch repair in s. cerevisiae.
