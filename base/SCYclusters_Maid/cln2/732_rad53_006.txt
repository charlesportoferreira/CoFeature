fork reversal and ssdna accumulation at stalled replication forks owing to checkpoint defects.. . checkpoint mediated control of replicating chromosomes is essential for preventing cancer. in yeast, rad kinase protects stalled replication forks from pathological rearrangements. to characterize the mechanisms controlling fork integrity, we analyzed replication intermediates formed in response to replication blocks using electron microscopy. at the forks, wild type cells accumulate short single stranded regions, which likely causes checkpoint activation, whereas rad mutants exhibit extensive single stranded gaps and hemi replicated intermediates, consistent with a lagging strand synthesis defect. further, rad cells accumulate holliday junctions through fork reversal. we speculate that, in checkpoint mutants, abnormal replication intermediates begin to form because of uncoordinated replication and are further processed by unscheduled recombination pathways, causing genome instability.
