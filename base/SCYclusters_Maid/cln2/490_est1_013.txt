a bulged stem tethers estp to telomerase rna in budding yeast.. . it is well established that the template for telomeric dna synthesis is provided by the rna subunit of telomerase; however, the additional functions provided by most of the rest of the rna (&gt; nucleotides in budding yeast) are largely unknown. by alignment of telomerase rnas of saccharomyces cerevisiae and six kluyveromyces species followed by mutagenesis of the s. cerevisiae rna, we found a conserved region that is essential for telomere maintenance. phylogenetic analysis and computer folding revealed that this region is conserved not only in primary nucleotide sequence but also in secondary structure. a common bulged stem structure was predicted in all seven yeast species. mutational analysis showed the structure to be essential for telomerase function. suppression of bulged stem mutant phenotypes by overexpression of estp and loss of co immunoprecipitation of the mutant rnas with estp indicated that this bulged stem is necessary for association of estp, a telomerase regulatory subunit. estp in yeast extract bound specifically to a small rna containing the bulged stem, suggesting a direct interaction. we propose that this rna structure links the enzymatic core of telomerase with estp, thereby allowing estp to recruit or activate telomerase at the telomere.
