association of the est protein with telomerase activity in yeast.. . the est mutant was previously identified because it is defective in telomere maintenance and displays a senescent phenotype. to see if est might be a component of yeast telomerase, we examined immunoprecipitated est. the yeast telomerase rna tlc specifically coprecipitated with est. furthermore, the est immunoprecipitates contained a telomerase like activity. as expected for yeast telomerase, the activity elongated telomeric primers, it required dgtp and dttp but not datp or dctp, and it was sensitive to rnase a. further evidence suggesting that the activity was telomerase was obtained from experiments using a tlc mutant strain, which has a mutant telomerase template containing dg residues. the activity immunoprecipitated from tlc mutant strains incorporated p labeled dctp, while activity from tlc strains did not. use of different telomeric primer substrates revealed two distinguishable telomerase like activities. one was dependent on tlc, and one was not. the tlc independent activity may be due to a second yeast telomerase rna, or it may be some other kind of activity.
