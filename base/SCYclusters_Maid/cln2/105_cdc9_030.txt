temperature sensitivity of the cdc allele of saccharomyces cerevisiae dna ligase is dependent on specific combinations of amino acids in the primary structure of the expressed protein.. . in this study we present the characterization of the temperature sensitive mutant allele cdc encoding dna ligase, of saccharomyces cerevisiae strain aa by dna sequencing. comparison with the published wild type sequence from strain sk revealed nucleotide exchanges between these two sequences, which are derived from non isogenic genetic backgrounds. only four of these changes, distributed over the whole coding region, lead to amino acid exchanges in the protein chain. our analysis of the sequence of the wild type cdc allele from strain aa revealed differences from the isogenic cdc allele in only two nucleotides. one silent change and one leading to a single amino acid exchange. the latter is therefore responsible for the temperature sensitive phenotype. a mosaic protein, in which a region carrying this amino acid exchange has been inserted in place of the corresponding part of cdc from the non isogenic strain sk, is not temperature sensitive. the exchange of a longer stretch of dna leading to atteration of three amino acids of the protein compared with the original sequence of sk is required to obtain a temperature sensitive dna ligase in this strain, while in strain aa a single amino acid change is sufficient for expression of a temperature sensitive protein.
