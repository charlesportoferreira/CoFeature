cdc cooperates with the yeast ku proteins and stn to regulate telomerase recruitment.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc protein binds single strand telomeric dna. here we report the isolation of new mutant alleles of cdc that confer either abnormal telomere lengthening or telomere shortening. this deregulation not only depended on telomerase (est/tlc) and est, a direct regulator of telomerase, but also on the yeast ku proteins, yku/hdf and yku/hdf, that have been previously implicated in dna repair and telomere maintenance. expression of a cdc yku fusion protein resulted in telomere elongation, similar to that produced by a cdc est fusion, thus suggesting that yku might promote cdc mediated telomerase recruitment. we also demonstrate that stn is an inhibitor of telomerase recruitment by cdc, based both on stn overexpression and cdc stn fusion experiments. we propose that accurate regulation of telomerase recruitment by cdc results from a coordinated balance between positive control by yku and negative control by stn. our results represent the first evidence of a direct control of the telomerase loading function of cdc by a double strand telomeric dna binding complex.
