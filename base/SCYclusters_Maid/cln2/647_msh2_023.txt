analysis of damage tolerance pathways in saccharomyces cerevisiae. a requirement for rev dna polymerase in translesion synthesis.. . the replication of double stranded plasmids containing a single n acetylaminofluorene (aaf) adduct located in a short, heteroduplex sequence was analyzed in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the strains used were proficient or deficient for the activity of dna polymerase zeta (rev and revdelta, respectively) in a mismatch and nucleotide excision repair defective background (mshdelta raddelta). the plasmid design enabled the determination of the frequency with which translesion synthesis (tls) and mechanisms avoiding the adduct by using the undamaged, complementary strand (damage avoidance mechanisms) are invoked to complete replication. to this end, a hybridization technique was implemented to probe plasmid dna isolated from individual yeast transformants by using short, p end labeled oligonucleotides specific to each strand of the heteroduplex. in both the rev and revdelta strains, the two strands of an unmodified heteroduplex plasmid were replicated in approximately % of the transformants, with the remaining % having possibly undergone prereplicative msh independent mismatch repair. however, in the presence of the aaf adduct, tls occurred in only % of the rev transformants, among which % was mostly error free and only % resulted in a mutation. all tls observed in the rev strain was abolished in the revdelta mutant, providing for the first time in vivo biochemical evidence of a requirement for the rev protein in tls.
