genetic and biochemical study of threonine overproducing mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . three threonine overproducing mutants were obtained as prototrophic revertants of a hom mutant strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the gene hom codes for aspartokinase (aspartate kinase; ec ...), the first enzyme of the threonine methionine biosynthetic route, which is subjected to feedback inhibition by threonine. enzymatic studies indicated that aspartokinase from the revertants has lost the feedback inhibition, resulting in overproduction of threonine. these revertants also bore one or two additional mutations, named tex and tex , which alone or jointly made possible the excretion of the threonine accumulated. the effect of these two genes on excretion is potentiated by excess inositol in the medium.
