human dna ligase i cdna. cloning and functional expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . human cdna clones encoding the major dna ligase activity in proliferating cells, dna ligase i, were isolated by two independent methods. in one approach, a human cdna library was screened by hybridization with oligonucleotides deduced from partial amino acid sequence of purified bovine dna ligase i. in an alternative approach, a human cdna library was screened for functional expression of a polypeptide able to complement a cdc temperature sensitive dna ligase mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sequence of an apparently full length cdna encodes a kda protein, indistinguishable in size from authentic human dna ligase i. the deduced amino acid sequence of the human dna ligase i cdna is % homologous to the smaller dna ligases of s. cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe, homology being confined to the carboxyl terminal regions of the respective proteins. hybridization between the cloned sequences and mrna and genomic dna indicates that the human enzyme is transcribed from a single copy gene on chromosome .
