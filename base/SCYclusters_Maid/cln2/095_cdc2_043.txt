the mutator mut of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the mut mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a cell division cycle mutant, exhibiting temperature sensitive lethality and enhancement of mutator activity with increases in temperature. the base sequence alterations in mutants arising in a mut background differed from the control by there being a higher transversion/transition ratio and by the much increased production of multi base deletions. the deletions were, in every instance, associated with repeated oligonucleotide sequences ( bases in length), where one of the two sequences was removed during the deletion process. the mutant mut failed to complement with cdc, the temperature sensitive mutant of the locus which encodes dna polymerase iii (delta).
