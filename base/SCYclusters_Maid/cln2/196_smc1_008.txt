fission yeast cut and cut, members of a ubiquitous protein family, are required for chromosome condensation and segregation in mitosis.. . fission yeast temperature sensitive mutants cut and cut fail to condense chromosomes but small portions of the chromosomes can separate along the spindle during mitosis, producing phi shaped chromosomes. septation and cell division occur in the absence of normal nuclear division, causing the cut phenotype. fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that the contraction of the chromosome arm during mitosis was defective. mutant chromosomes are apparently not rigid enough to be transported poleward by the spindle. loss of the cut protein by gene disruption fails to maintain the nuclear chromatin architecture even in interphase. both cut and cut proteins contain a putative nucleoside triphosphate (ntp) binding domain and belong to the same ubiquitous protein family which includes the budding yeast smc protein. the cut mutant was suppressed by an increase in the cut+ gene dosage. the cut protein, having the highest similarity to the mouse protein, is localized in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. plasmids carrying the dna topoisomerase i gene partly suppressed the temperature sensitive phenotype of cut , suggesting that the cut protein might be involved in chromosome dna topology.
