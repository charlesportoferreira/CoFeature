cloning of the cdna of the heme regulated eukaryotic initiation factor alpha (eif alpha) kinase of rabbit reticulocytes. homology to yeast gcn protein kinase and human double stranded rna dependent eif alpha kinase.. . we have cloned the cdna of the heme regulated eif alpha kinase (hri) of rabbit reticulocytes. in vitro translation of mrna transcribed from the hri cdna yields a kda polypeptide that exhibits eif alpha kinase activity and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against authentic hri. the open reading frame sequence of the hri cdna contains all catalytic domains of protein kinases with consensus sequences of protein serine/threonine kinases in conserved catalytic domains vi and viii. the hri cdna also contains an insert of approximately amino acids between catalytic domains v and vi. the hri cdna coding sequence has extensive homology to gcn protein kinase of saccharomyces cerevisiae and to human double stranded rna dependent eif alpha kinase. this observation suggests that gcn protein kinase may be an eif alpha kinase in yeast. in addition, hri has an unusually high degree of homology to three protein kinases (nima, wee, and cdc) that are involved in the regulation of the cell cycle.
