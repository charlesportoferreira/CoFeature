cdc is required in conjunction with cdc/dbf to trigger the initiation of dna replication.. . the initiation of dna replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the protein product of the cdc gene. we report that although cdcp is present at essentially constant levels throughout the cell cycle, it completes its initiation function in late g, after start and prior to dna synthesis. shortly after mitosis, cells prepare for initiation by assembling prereplicative complexes at their replication origins. these complexes are then triggered at the onset of s phase to commence dna replication. cells defective for cdc are incapable of activating the complexes to initiate dna replication. in addition, cdcp and cdcp/dbfp, a kinase implicated in the g/s phase transition, are dependent on one another for function. these data indicate that cdc functions in late g phase in concert with cdc/dbf to trigger initiation at replication origins after the assembly of the prereplicative complexes.
