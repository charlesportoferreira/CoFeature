yeast dna polymerase dna primase complex; cloning of pri , a single essential gene related to dna primase activity.. . the immunopurified yeast dna polymerase dna primase complex is constituted by dna polymerase i polypeptides and by three other protein species, called p, p and p, which we show to be immunologically unrelated. the gene encoding the p polypeptide has been identified by immunological screening of a lambda gt yeast genomic dna library. antiserum specific for p inhibits dna primase, and immunoreactive, inhibitory antibodies are affinity purified by the clone encoded protein, thus relating the p polypeptide to dna primase activity. the entire gene has been cloned, and the . kb p mrna is overproduced in cells containing the gene in high copy number. gene disruption and southern hybridization experiments demonstrate that the p protein is encoded by a single gene and it performs an essential function.
