a novel allele of saccharomyces cerevisiae rfa that is deficient in recombination and repair and suppressible by rad.. . to understand the mechanisms involved in homologous recombination, we have performed a search for saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants unable to carry out plasmid to chromosome gene conversion. for this purpose, we have developed a colony color assay in which recombination is induced by the controlled delivery of double strand breaks (dsbs). recombination occurs between a chromosomal mutant ade allele and a second plasmid borne ade allele where dsbs are introduced via the site specific ho endonuclease. besides isolating a number of new alleles in known rad genes, we identified a novel allele of the rfa gene, rfa , which encodes the large subunit of the heterotrimeric yeast single stranded dna binding protein rpa. characterization of rfa revealed that it is, like members of the rad epistasis group, sensitive to x rays, high doses of uv, and ho induced dsbs. in addition, rfa shows a reduced ability to undergo sporulation and ho induced gene conversion. the mutation was mapped to a single base substitution resulting in an aspartate at amino acid residue instead of glycine. moreover, all radiation sensitivities and repair defects of rfa are suppressed by rad in a dose dependent manner, and one rad mutant allele, rad , displays nonallelic noncomplementation when crossed with rfa . presented is a model accounting for this genetic interaction in which rfa, in a complex with rad, serves to assemble other proteins of the recombination repair machinery at the site of dsbs and other kinds of dna damage. we believe that our findings and those of j. smith and r. rothstein (mol. cell. biol. . , ) are the first in vivo demonstrations of the involvement of a eukaryotic single stranded binding protein in recombination and repair processes.
