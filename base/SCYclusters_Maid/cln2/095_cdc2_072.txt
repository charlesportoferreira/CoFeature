a novel mammalian protein kinase gene (mak) is highly expressed in testicular germ cells at and after meiosis.. . we isolated a novel gene designated mak (male germ cell associated kinase) by using weak cross hybridization with a tyrosine kinase gene (v ros). sequence analysis of the cdna corresponding to the . kilobase transcript revealed that the predicted product of rat mak consisted of amino acids and contained protein kinase consensus motifs in its amino terminal region. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of mak in the kinase domain with those of other protein kinase genes demonstrated that mak was approximately % identical to the cdc cdc gene family in schizosaccharomyces pombe, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and humans but less identical to most other protein kinase gene products. expression of mak was highly tissue specific, and its transcripts were detected almost exclusively in testicular cells entering and after meiosis but hardly detectable in ovarian cells including oocytes, after the dictyotene stage. these results suggest that the mak gene plays an important role in spermatogenesis.
