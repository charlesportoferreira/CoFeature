a dna damage response pathway controlled by tel and the mre complex.. . we define a dna damage checkpoint pathway in s. cerevisiae governed by the atm homolog tel and the mre complex. in mitotic cells, the tel mre complex pathway triggers rad activation and its interaction with rad, whereas in meiosis it acts via rad and the rad paralog mre/mek. activation of the tel mre complex pathway checkpoint functions appears to depend upon the mre complex as a damage sensor and, at least in meiotic cells, to depend on unprocessed dna double strand breaks (dsbs). the dsb repair functions of the mre complex are enhanced by the pathway, suggesting that the complex both initiates and is regulated by the tel dependent dsb signal. these findings demonstrate that the diverse functions of the mre complex in the cellular dna damage response are conserved in mammals and yeast.
