structure and function of a new phosphopeptide binding domain containing the fha of rad.. . the forkhead associated (fha) domain is a amino acid residue module found in &gt; proteins from yeast to human. it has been suggested to participate in signal transduction pathways, perhaps via protein protein interactions involving recognition of phosphopeptides. neither the structure nor the ligand of fha is known. yeast rad, a checkpoint protein involved in dna damage response, contains two fha domains, fha (residues ) and fha (residues ), the second of which recognizes phosphorylated rad. we herein report the solution structure of an &quot;fha containing domain&quot; of rad (residues ). the structure consists of a beta sandwich containing two antiparallel beta sheets and a short, c terminal alpha helix. binding experiments suggested that the fha containing domain specifically recognizes ptyr and a ptyr containing peptide from rad, and that the binding site involves residues highly conserved across fha domains. the results, along with other recent reports, suggest that fha domains could have ptyr and pser/thr dual specificity. copyright academic press.
