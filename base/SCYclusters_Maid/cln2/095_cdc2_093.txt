sit phosphatase is functionally linked to the ubiquitin proteasome system.. . using a synthetic lethality screen we found that the sit phosphatase is functionally linked to the ubiquitin proteasome system. yeast cells harboring sit mutations and an impaired proteasome (due to pre pre mutations) exhibited defective growth on minimal medium. nearly identical synthetic effects were found when sit mutations were combined with defects of the rad/ubc and cdc/ubc dependent ubiquitination pathways. under synthetic lethal conditions, sit pre or sit ubc mutants formed strongly enlarged unbudded cells with a dna content of n, indicating a defect in the maintenance of cell integrity during starvation induced g() arrest. sit related synthetic effects could be cured by high osmotic pressure or by the addition of certain amino acids to the growth medium. these results suggest a concerted function of the sit phosphatase and the ubiquitin proteasome system in osmoregulation and in the sensing of nutrients. further analysis showed that sit is not a target of proteasome dependent protein degradation. we could also show that sit does not contribute to regulation of proteasome activity. these data suggest that both sit phosphatase and the proteasome act on a common target protein.
