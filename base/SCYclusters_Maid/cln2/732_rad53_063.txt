yeast histone a serine is essential for the efficient repair of checkpoint blind dna damage.. . cells maintain genomic stability by the coordination of dna damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint control. in replicating cells, dna damage usually activates intra s phase checkpoint controls, which are characterized by delayed s phase progression and increased rad phosphorylation. we show that in budding yeast, the intra s phase checkpoint controls, although functional, are not activated by the topoisomerase i inhibitor camptothecin (cpt). in a cpt hypersensitive mutant strain that lacks the histone a (ha) phosphatidylinositol oh kinase (pi()k) motif at ser (ha sa), the hypersensitivity was found to result from a failure to process full length chromosomal dna molecules during ongoing replication. ha ser is not epistatic to the rad and rad checkpoint genes, suggesting a non checkpoint role for the ha pi()k site. these results suggest that ha ser is an essential component for the efficient repair of dna double stranded breaks (dsbs) during replication in yeast, particularly of those dsbs that do not induce the intra s phase checkpoint.
