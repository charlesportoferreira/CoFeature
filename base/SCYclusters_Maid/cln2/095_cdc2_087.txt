interaction of the cdk associated protein , p(doc /cdkap), with its homolog, p(doc r).. . human doc /cdkap gene encodes a growth suppressor protein of kda (p(doc /cdkap)). recently, p(doc /cdkap) has been shown to associate with cell cycle proteins including cdk and dna polymerase alpha/primase. it negatively regulates cdk activities and suppresses dna replication. therefore, identification of other p(doc /cdkap) interacting proteins might clarify its role in the cell cycle regulation and carcinogenesis. the purpose of this study was to identify additional p(doc /cdkap) interacting proteins using the yeast two hybrid system. using human p(doc /cdkap) as a bait in a liver cdna library screening, cdna clones identical to human doc r transcript were identified. the interaction between p(doc /cdkap) and p(doc r) was verified in vitro and in cells. gst pull down assay and immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between the two proteins. the critical region for p(doc /cdkap)'s interaction with p(doc r) was defined to amino acids by using a series of deletion mutants as baits in the yeast two hybrid system. our data indicated that p(doc /cdkap) could associate with its homologous protein, p(doc r).
