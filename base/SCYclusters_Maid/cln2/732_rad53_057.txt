a domain of rad specifically required for activation of chk in budding yeast.. . the rad protein is a key adaptor protein in saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint pathways. its adaptor function is to link the activity of the mec kinase to the activation of two parallel signalling pathways dependent on the rad and chk kinases. the mechanisms by which rad interacts with, and activates, rad are well understood. however, little was known about how rad facilitates the activation of chk. we show here that the n terminus of rad is specifically important for phosphorylation and activation of the chk kinase but not for the phosphorylation and activation of the rad kinase. the chk activation domain (cad) of rad is specifically important for signalling cell cycle arrest after cdc and ykudelta induced telomere damage but not for tolerating ultraviolet induced damage or inhibiting nuclease activity at telomeres. this work extends data showing that separable domains within the rad adaptor protein allow it to activate two distinct kinase signalling pathways independently of each other.
