yeast as a model system for mammalian seven transmembrane segment receptors.. . investigators have used the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system in which to study the beta adrenergic receptor, the t cell receptor pathway, initiation of mammalian dna replication, initiation of mammalian transcription, secretion, the cdc kinase system, cell cycle control, and aging, as well as the function of oncogenes. this list continues to grow with the discovery of an immunoglobulin heavy chain binding homologue in yeast, an rb binding protein homologue, and a possible yeast arrestin. yeast is relatively easy to maintain, to grow, and to genetically manipulate. a single gene can be overexpressed, selectively mutated or deleted from its chromosomal location. in this way, the in vivo function of a gene can be studied. it has become reasonable to consider yeast as a model system for studying the seven transmembrane segments ( tms) receptor family. currently, subtypes of the beta adrenergic receptor are being studied in yeast. the receptor and its g alpha g protein, trigger the mating pheromone receptor pathway. this provides a powerful assay for determining receptor function. studies expressing the muscarinic cholinergic receptor in yeast are underway. the yeast pheromone receptor belongs to this receptor family, sharing sequence and secondary structure homology. an effective strategy has been to identify a yeast pathway or process which is homologous to a mammalian system. the pathway is delineated in yeast, identifying other genetic components. then yeast genes are used to screen for human homologues of these components. the putative human homologues are then expressed in yeast and in mammalian cells to determine function. when this type of &quot;mixing and matching&quot; works, yeast genetics can be a powerful tool.
