hsp chaperone complexes are required for the activity and stability of yeast protein kinases mik, wee and swe.. . the wee protein kinase negatively regulates entry into mitosis by mediating the inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc cyclin b kinase. the stability and activity of wee from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe is critically dependent on functional hsp chaperones. here we identify two related tyrosine protein kinases, mik from fission yeast and its saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog swe, as hsp substrates and show that the kinase domain is sufficient to mediate this interaction. morphological and biochemical defects arising from overexpression of the kinases in fission yeast are suppressed in the conditional hsp mutant swo . a subset of all three kinases is associated with the hsp cochaperones cyclophilin and p. under conditions of impaired chaperone function or treatment with the hsp inhibitory drug geldanamycin, intracellular levels of the kinases are reduced and the proteins become rapidly degraded by the proteasome machinery, indicating that wee, mik and swe require hsp heterocomplexes for their stability and maintenance of function.
