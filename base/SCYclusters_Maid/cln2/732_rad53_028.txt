cdcp dbfp kinase binds to chromatin during s phase and is regulated by both the apc and the rad checkpoint pathway.. . eukaryotic cells coordinate chromosome duplication by assembly of protein complexes at origins of dna replication and by activation of cyclin dependent kinase and cdcp dbfp kinase. we show in saccharomyces cerevisiae that although cdcp levels are constant during the cell division cycle, dbfp and cdcp dbfp kinase activity fluctuate. dbfp binds to chromatin near the g()/s phase boundary well after binding of the minichromosome maintenance (mcm) proteins, and it is stabilized at the non permissive temperature in mutants of the anaphase promoting complex, suggesting that dbfp is targeted for destruction by ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. arresting cells with hydroxyurea (hu) or with mutations in genes encoding dna replication proteins results in a more stable, hyper phosphorylated form of dbfp and an attenuated kinase activity. the dbfp phosphorylation in response to hu is rad dependent. this suggests that an s phase checkpoint function regulates cdcp dbfp kinase activity. cdcp may also play a role in adapting from the checkpoint response since deletion of cdc results in hu hypersensitivity. recombinant cdcp dbfp kinase was purified and both subunits were autophosphorylated. cdcp dbfp efficiently phosphorylates several proteins that are required for the initiation of dna replication, including five of the six mcm proteins and the p subunit of dna polymerase alpha primase.
