characterization of the hyperrecombination phenotype of the pol t mutation of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the dna polymerase delta (polp/cdcp) allele pol t of saccharomyces cerevisiae has previously been shown to increase the frequency of deletions between short repeats (several base pairs), between homologous dna sequences separated by long inverted repeats, and between distant short repeats, increasing the frequency of genomic deletions. we found that the pol t mutation increased intrachromosomal recombination events between direct dna repeats up to fold and interchromosomal recombination fold. the hyperrecombination phenotype of pol t was partially dependent on the radp function but much more so on radp. however, in the double mutant rad delta rad delta, the pol t mutation still increased spontaneous intrachromosomal recombination frequencies, suggesting that a radp radp independent single strand annealing pathway is involved. uv and gamma rays were less potent inducers of recombination in the pol t mutant, indicating that polp is partly involved in dna damage induced recombination. in contrast, while uv and gamma ray induced intrachromosomal recombination was almost completely abolished in the rad or the rad rad mutant, there was still good induction in those mutants in the pol t background, indicating channeling of lesions into the above mentioned radp radp independent pathway. finally, a heterozygous pol t/pol mutant also showed an increased frequency of deletions and mms sensitivity at the restrictive temperature, indicating that even a heterozygous polymerase delta mutation might increase the frequency of genetic instability.
