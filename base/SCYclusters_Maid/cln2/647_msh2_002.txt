functional analysis of hmlh variants and hnpcc related mutations using a human expression system.. . background &amp; aims. germline mutations in the dna mismatch repair (mmr) genes hmlh and hmsh are associated with susceptibility to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc). because a significant proportion of hmlh mutations are missense, the assessment of their pathogenic role may be difficult. to date, functional analysis of missense mutations has been performed primarily in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the aim of this study was to examine the biochemical properties of hmlh protein variants in a human expression system. methods. the hnpcc related hmlh mutations tm, vg, rc, gd, rc, va, and kt, the polymorphisms iv and rh, and a hmlh splicing variant lacking exon and (hmlh delta /) were cloned. on transfection of these constructs into human t cells, which do not express hmlh because of promoter hypermethylation, the hmlh protein variants were analyzed by western blotting and in a mmr assay. results. transfection was successful for all hmlh constructs. as anticipated, the mutations kt and tm, which affect the highly conserved domains of hmlh that are necessary for interaction with hpms or for adenosine triphosphate (atp) binding, respectively, affected protein stability or its ability to complement mmr deficient t cell extracts. the vg, gd, and delta / variants were also unable to complement mmr in t cells, whereas hmlh proteins carrying the iv, rh, rc, rc, and va mutations were mmr competent. conclusions. these data show that the pathogenic role of hmlh missense mutations and splicing variants can be assessed by analyzing the biochemical properties of their protein products in a homologous expression system.
