spk is an essential s phase specific gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a nuclear serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase.. . spk was originally discovered in an immunoscreen for tyrosine protein kinases in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we have used biochemical and genetic techniques to investigate the function of this gene and its encoded protein. hybridization of an spk probe to an ordered genomic library showed that spk is adjacent to pep (chromosome xvi l). sporulation of spk/+ heterozygotes gave rise to spk spores that grew into microcolonies but could not be further propagated. these colonies were greatly enriched for budded cells, especially those with large buds. similarly, eviction of cen plasmids bearing spk from cells with a chromosomal spk disruption yielded viable cells with only low frequency. spk protein was identified by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. it was associated with protein ser, thr, and tyr kinase activity in immune complex kinase assays. spk was localized to the nucleus by immunofluorescence. the nucleotide sequence of the spk ' noncoding region revealed that spk contains two mlui cell cycle box elements. these elements confer s phase specific transcription to many genes involved in dna synthesis. northern (rna) blotting of synchronized cells verified that the spk transcript is coregulated with other mlui box regulated genes. the spk upstream region also includes a domain highly homologous to sequences involved in induction of rad and other excision repair genes by agents that induce dna damage. spk strains were hypersensitive to uv irradiation. taken together, these findings indicate that spk is a dual specificity (ser/thr and tyr) protein kinase that is essential for viability. the cell cycle dependent transcription, presence of dna damage related sequences, requirement for uv resistance, and nuclear localization of spk all link this gene to a crucial s phase specific role, probably as a positive regulator of dna synthesis.
