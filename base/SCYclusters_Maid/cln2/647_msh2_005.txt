cloning of the ppmsh cdna of physcomitrella patens, a moss in which gene targeting by homologous recombination occurs at high frequency.. . in the moss physcomitrella patens integrative transformants from homologous recombination are obtained at an efficiency comparable to that found for yeast. this property, unique in the plant kingdom, allows the knockout of specific genes. it also makes the moss a convenient model to study the regulation of homologous recombination in plants. we used degenerate oligonucleotides designed from atmsh from arabidopsis thaliana and other known muts homologues to isolate the p. patens msh (ppmsh) cdna. the deduced sequence of the ppmsh protein is respectively .% and .% identical to the maize and a. thaliana msh. phylogenic studies show that ppmsh is closely related to the group of plant msh proteins. southern analysis reveals that the gene exists as a single copy in the p. patens genome.
