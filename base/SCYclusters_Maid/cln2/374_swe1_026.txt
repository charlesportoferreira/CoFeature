calcium and cell cycle progression. possible effects of external perturbations on cell proliferation.. . exit from the phase of cellular division appears to be driven by a calcium signal that triggers a cascade of events leading to the completion of mitosis. here we propose a model that relates the dynamics of cytosolic calcium to progression through mitosis, g and g phases of the cell cycle. to this end, the assumption has been made that the transient rise ir cytosolic calcium concentration during mitosis is induced by inositol(,,)triphosphate (ip), which in turn is released at high levels of mitosis promoting factor (mpf). on this basis, a system of ordinary differential equations is proposed to simulate the evolution of ten cell cycle specific molecular species, including cyclins a and b, mpf, ip, ca+, the camkii holoenzyme, and the ubiquitination complex. the influence on the cell proliferation capacity exerted by external perturbations, like calcium microinjections, depletion of intracellular calcium stores, electromagnetic fields, or stimulation/inhibition of different calcium currents through the plasma membrane, can be studied by appropriate modulation of the parameters involved in the signal transduction pathway.
