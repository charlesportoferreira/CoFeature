fission yeast rad stimulates sister chromatid recombination and links cohesion with repair.. . to study the role of rad in the dna damage response, we cloned and deleted the schizosaccharomyces pombe rad homologue. the deletion is sensitive to a range of dna damaging agents and shows dynamic epistatic interactions with other recombination repair genes. we show that rad is necessary for recombinational repair of the dna lesion at the mating type locus and that raddelta shows slow dna replication. we also find that rad is not required for slowing down s phase in response to hydroxy urea or methyl methanesulfonate (mms) treatment. interestingly, in raddelta cells, the recombination frequency between two homologous chromosomes is increased at the expense of sister chromatid recombination. we propose that rad, an smc like protein, promotes the use of the sister chromatid as the template for homologous recombinational repair. in support of this, we found that rad functions in the same pathway for the repair of mms induced damage as rad, the homologue of the saccharomyces cerevisiae scc cohesin protein. we speculate that rad interacts with the cohesin complex during s phase to assist repair and possibly re initiation of replication after replication fork collapse.
