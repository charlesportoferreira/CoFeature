mutations in dna replication genes reduce yeast life span.. . surprisingly, the contribution of defects in dna replication to the determination of yeast life span has never been directly investigated. we show that a replicative yeast helicase/nuclease, encoded by dna and a member of the same helicase subfamily as the recq helicases, is required for normal life span. all of the phenotypes of old wild type cells, for example, extended cell cycle time, age related transcriptional silencing defects, and nucleolar reorganization, occur after fewer generations in dna mutants than in the wild type. in addition, the life span of dna mutants is extended by expression of an additional copy of sir or by deletion of fob, which also increase wild type life span. the ribosomal dna locus and the nucleolus seem to be particularly sensitive to defects in dna mutants, although in dna mutants extrachromosomal ribosomal circles do not accumulate during the aging of a mother cell. several other replication mutations, such as rad delta, encoding the fen nuclease involved in several aspects of genomic stability, also show premature aging. we propose that replication fork failure due to spontaneous, endogenous dna damage and attendant genomic instability may contribute to replicative senescence. this may imply that the genomic instability, segmental premature aging symptoms, and cancer predisposition associated with the human recq helicase diseases, such as werner, bloom, and rothmund thomson syndromes, are also related to replicative stress.
