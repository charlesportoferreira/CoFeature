dependence of inessential late gene expression on early meiotic events in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . spr is one of at least nine genes which are expressed in sporulating saccharomyces cerevisiae cells at the time of meiosis i. we show below that strains homozygous for null alleles of spr are capable of normal meiosis and the production of viable ascospores. we have also monitored spr expression in a series of strains that are defective in meiotic development, using an spr.lacz fusion carried on a single copy plasmid. beta galactosidase activity occurred at wild type levels in diploid strains homozygous for mutations in spo, rad, rad and cdc, but was greatly reduced in strains carrying cdc or spo defects. we conclude that spr expression is a valid monitor of early meiotic development, even though the gene is inessential for the sporulation process.
