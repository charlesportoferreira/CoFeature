rad phosphorylation sites couple rad to the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint.. . rad is required for the mec/tel dependent activation of saccharomyces cerevisiae dna damage checkpoint pathways mediated by rad and chk. dna damage induces rad phosphorylation, and rad specifically associates with phosphorylated rad. we report here that multiple mec/tel consensus [s/t]q sites within rad are phosphorylated in response to dna damage. these rad phosphorylation sites are selectively required for activation of the rad branch of the checkpoint pathway. consistent with the in vivo function in recruiting rad, rad phosphopeptides are bound by rad forkhead associated (fha) domains in vitro. these data suggest that functionally independent domains within rad regulate rad and chk, and support the model that fha domain mediated recognition of rad phosphopeptides couples rad to the dna damage checkpoint pathway.
