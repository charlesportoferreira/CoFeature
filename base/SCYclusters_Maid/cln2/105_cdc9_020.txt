a candida albicans gene encoding a dna ligase.. . a dna ligase encoding gene (ca cdc) was cloned from candida albicans by complementation of an ime mutation in saccharomyces cerevisiae. in this system, ime function was assayed using a s. cerevisiae strain with a ime promoter lacz gene fusion such that following transformation with a c. albicans genomic library, the presence of positive clones was indicated upon the addition of x gal to sporulation media. transforming fragments were subcloned in pgem and sequenced. sequence homology with several atp dependent dna ligases from viruses, fission yeast, human, baker yeast and bacteria was observed.
