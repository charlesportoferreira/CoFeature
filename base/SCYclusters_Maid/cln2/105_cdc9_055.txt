ligase deficient yeast cells exhibit defective dna rejoining and enhanced gamma ray sensitivity.. . yeast cells deficient in dna ligase were also deficient in their capacity to rejoin single strand scissions in prelabeled nuclear dna. after high dose rate gamma irradiation ( and krads), cdc mutant cells failed to rejoin single strand scissions at the restrictive temperature of degrees c. in contrast, parental (cdc) cells (incubated with mutant cells both during and after irradiation) exhibited rapid medium independent dna rejoining after min of post irradiation incubation and slower rates of rejoining after longer incubation. parental cells were also more resistant than mutant cells to killing by gamma irradiation. approximately . +/ . and . +/ . single strand breaks per () daltons were detected in dnas from either cdc or cdc cells converted to spheroplasts immediately after and krads of irradiation, respectively. at the permissive temperature of degrees c, the cdc cells contained to times the number of dna single strand breaks as parental cells after min to h of incubation after krads of irradiation, and two to eightfold more breaks after min to . h of incubation after krads of irradiation. rejoining of single strand scissions was faster in medium. after only min in buffered growth medium and after krads of irradiation, the number of dna single strand breaks was reduced to . +/ . (at degrees c) or . +/ . (at degrees c) per () daltons in parental cells, but remained at . +/ . (at degrees c) or . +/ . (at degrees c) per () daltons in mutant cells. after or krads of irradiation plus h of incubation in medium at degrees c, only dna from cdc cells was rejoined to the size of dna from unirradiated cells, whereas at degrees c, dnas in both strains were completely rejoined.
