isolation of a toxoplasma gondii cyclin by yeast two hybrid interactive screen.. . gal based yeast two hybrid cdna libraries from toxoplasma gondii rh strain were constructed and screened for interactors of a putative t. gondii cdc related kinase, tgcrk. a screen of . million transformants yielded a single yeast clone that harbored a protein fusion capable of specifically interacting with tgcrk. sequencing revealed the cdna insert (tgcyc) had homology to the cyclin class of proteins. the tgcyc cdna fragment was used to probe a conventional t. gondii cdna library and a . kb cdna coding for a predicted protein of amino acids was obtained. based on comparison with a ' race product from tachyzoite mrna, the . kb cdna for tgcyc appeared to be complete. tgcyc had the highest similarity to plasmodium falciparum cyc and displayed sequence characteristics that place it in the cyclin h class of eukaryotic cyclins. in synchronous tachyzoite populations the level of tgcyc mrna was unchanged indicating it is not cell cycle regulated at the mrna level. tgcyc rescues the g()/s cyclin cell cycle defect in s. cerevisiae strain dl demonstrating that this apicomplexan cyclin can function in an established heterologous model system.
