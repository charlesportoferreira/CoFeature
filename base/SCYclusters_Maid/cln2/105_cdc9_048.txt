induction of yeast dna ligase genes in exponential and stationary phase cultures in response to dna damaging agents.. . uv irradiation of stationary phase cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe leads to a fold and fold increase in transcript levels from the respective dna ligase genes cdc and cdc, whereas exponential cells show only fold and fold increases. induction of cdc after mms treatment and gamma irradiation was also observed by using a cdc lacz translational fusion and assaying for beta galactosidase. surprisingly, irradiation of s. cerevisiae induces only a % increase in dna ligase itself, probably reflecting the extremely high in vivo stability of the enzyme. the uv induction of ligase may be part of a &quot;fail safe&quot; mechanism which, together with the enzyme stability, ensures adequate supplies of this essential enzyme.
