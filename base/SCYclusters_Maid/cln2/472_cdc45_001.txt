requirement of cdc for postimplantation mouse development.. . cdc is required for the initiation of dna replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae and functions as a dna polymerase alpha loading factor in xenopus, but its role in mammalian dna replication is unknown. to investigate the genetic and physiological functions of cdc, we used a gene targeting strategy to generate mice lacking a functional cdc gene. homozygous mutant mice lacking a functional cdc gene underwent uterine implantation and induced uterine decidualization but did not develop substantially thereafter. detailed analysis of cdc null embryos cultured in vitro revealed impaired proliferation of the inner cell mass. these findings make cdc the only putative replication factor experimentally proven to be essential for mammalian development. the cdc gene localizes to human chromosome q. in the digeorge syndrome critical region (dgcr). almost % of individuals with congenital cardiac and craniofacial defects have a monoallelic deletion in the dgcr that includes cdc. we report here that heterozygous mutant mice develop into adulthood without any apparent abnormalities, so that it is unlikely that hemizygosity of cdc alone is responsible for the cardiac and craniofacial defects in the congenital syndromes.
