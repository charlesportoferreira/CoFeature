an n terminal domain of dbfp mediates interaction with both origin recognition complex (orc) and radp and can deregulate late origin firing.. . the dbfcdc kinase acts at the level of individual origins to promote the initiation of dna replication. we demonstrate through both immunoprecipitation and two hybrid assays that a domain comprising the first aa of dbfp interacts with orcp and orcp subunits of the origin recognition complex (orc). given that the activation of rad kinase in response to the dna replication checkpoint leads to the release of dbfp from an orc containing chromatin fraction, we also examined interaction between dbfp and radp. this same domain of dbfp binds specifically to the forkhead homology associated (fha) domains of radp. cell cycle arrest in g()m, provoked by the overexpression of the dbf domain, is suppressed in a rad mutant. moreover, its overexpression perturbs the regulation of late, but not early, origin firing in wild type cells after treatment with hydroxyurea.
