the pattern of sensitivity of yeast dna mutants to dna damaging agents suggests a role in dsb and postreplication repair pathways.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna gene encodes a dna stimulated atpase and dna helicase/nuclease essential for dna replication. in characterizing dna mutants, we have found that dnap also participates in dna repair or in damage avoidance mechanisms. dna mutants are sensitive to x rays, although they are less sensitive than rad mutants. the x ray sensitivity of dna mutants is suppressed by overexpression of a ' to ' exonuclease, the yeast fen structure specific nuclease, encoded by the rad gene, which also suppresses the growth defect of dna ts mutants. sgs encodes a helicase with similar properties to dna protein. although sgsdelta mutants are resistant to x rays, dna sgsdelta double mutants are more sensitive to x rays than the dna mutant. temperature sensitive dna mutants are only slightly sensitive to uv light, show normal levels of spontaneous and uv induced mutagenesis, and have only a . fold elevated level of dinucleotide tract instability compared to wildtype. however, dnadelta strains kept alive by overproduction of rad are highly sensitive to uv light. these phenotypes, in addition to the epistasis analysis reported, allow us to propose that dna is involved in postreplication and dsb repair pathways.
