ubc, a dna damage inducible gene, is a member of the error free postreplication repair pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the ubc protein was recently identified for its unique role in ubiquitin (ub) chain assembly at the ub lys residue instead of the conventional lys residue. this activity requires ubc to form a complex with mms and indeed ubc and mms mutations have been shown elsewhere to be epistatic with respect to uv sensitivity. the mms gene is known to be a member of the error free dna postreplication repair (prr) pathway. by contrast, the ub lys residue has been previously implicated in the error prone prr pathway, since yeast cells carrying the ubikr mutation are defective in uv induced mutagenesis. in the present study, we attempted to define the role of ubc within the prr pathway. we found that the ubc mutation is epistatic to mms and rad, confirming that ubc belongs to the prr pathway. we also found that ubc is synergistic to the error prone prr pathway mutation rev, indicating that ubc is in a pathway alternative to rev mutagenesis. the ubc mutant displays up to a fold increase in the spontaneous mutation rate, and this increase is largely rev dependent. in addition, uv induced mutagenesis is fully functional in the ubc mutant. these results together demonstrate that ubc is a member of the error free prr pathway. the involvement of ubc in cellular tolerance to dna damage is further implicated by our finding that the ubc transcript level is increased up to fold in response to dna damage.
