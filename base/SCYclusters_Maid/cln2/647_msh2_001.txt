multiple pathways promote short sequence recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, null alleles of several dna repair and recombination genes confer defects in recombination that grow more severe with decreasing sequence length, indicating that they are required for short sequence recombination (ssr). rad and rad, which encode the subunits of the structure specific endonuclease rad/, are critical for ssr. mre, rad, and xrs, which encode the subunits of m/r/x, another complex with nuclease activity, are also crucially important. genetic evidence suggests that rad/ and m/r/x act on the same class of substrates during ssr. msh and msh, which encode subunits of msh/, a complex active during mismatch repair and recombination, are also important for ssr but play a more restricted role. additional evidence suggests that ssr is distinct from nonhomologous end joining and is superimposed upon basal homologous recombination.
