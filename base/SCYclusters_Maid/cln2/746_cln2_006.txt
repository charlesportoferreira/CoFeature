genetic analysis of the relationship between activation loop phosphorylation and cyclin binding in the activation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdcp cyclin dependent kinase.. . we showed recently that a screen for mutant cdc with improved binding to a defective clnp g cyclin yielded a spectrum of mutations similar to those yielded by a screen for intragenic suppressors of the requirement for activation loop phosphorylation (te suppressors). recombination among these mutations yielded cdc mutants that bypassed the g cyclin requirement. here we analyze further the interrelationship between te suppression, interaction with defective cyclin, and g cyclin bypass. dna shuffling of mutations from the various screens and recombination onto a te encoding ' end yielded cdc mutants with strong te suppression. some of the strongest te suppressors could suppress the defective clnp g cyclin even while retaining te. the strong te suppressors did not exhibit bypass of the g cyclin requirement but did so when te was reverted to t. these results suggested that for these mutants, activation loop phosphorylation and cyclin binding might be alternative means of activation rather than independent requirements for activation (as with wild type). these results suggest mechanistic overlap between the conformational shift induced by cyclin binding and that induced by activation loop phosphorylation. this conclusion was supported by analysis of suppressors of a mutation in the cdk phosphothreonine binding pocket created by cyclin binding.
