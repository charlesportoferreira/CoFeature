molecular evolution allows bypass of the requirement for activation loop phosphorylation of the cdc cyclin dependent kinase.. . many protein kinases are regulated by phosphorylation in the activation loop, which is required for enzymatic activity. glutamic acid can substitute for phosphothreonine in some proteins activated by phosphorylation, but this substitution (te) at the site of activation loop phosphorylation in the saccharomyces cerevisiae cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) cdcp blocks biological function and protein kinase activity. using cycles of error prone dna amplification followed by selection for successively higher levels of function, we identified mutant versions of cdcp te with high biological activity. the enzymatic and biological activity of the mutant cdcp was essentially normally regulated by cyclin, and the mutants supported normal cell cycle progression and regulation. therefore, it is not a requirement for control of the yeast cell cycle that cdcp be cyclically phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. these cdc mutants allow viability in the absence of cakp, the essential kinase that phosphorylates cdcp t, demonstrating that t phosphorylation is the only essential function of cakp. some growth defects remain in suppressed cak cdc strains carrying the mutant cdc genes, consistent with additional nonessential roles for cak.
