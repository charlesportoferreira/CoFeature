sister chromatid separation at anaphase onset is promoted by cleavage of the cohesin subunit scc.. . cohesion between sister chromatids is established during dna replication and depends on a multiprotein complex called cohesin. attachment of sister kinetochores to the mitotic spindle during mitosis generates forces that would immediately split sister chromatids were it not opposed by cohesion. cohesion is essential for the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase but must be abolished for sister separation to start during anaphase. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, loss of sister chromatid cohesion depends on a separating protein (separin) called esp and is accompanied by dissociation from the chromosomes of the cohesion subunit scc. here we show that esp causes the dissociation of scc from chromosomes by stimulating its cleavage by proteolysis. a mutant scc is described that is resistant to esp dependent cleavage and which blocks both sister chromatid separation and the dissociation of scc from chromosomes. the evolutionary conservation of separins indicates that the proteolytic cleavage of cohesion proteins might be a general mechanism for triggering anaphase.
