mutations in the rna polymerase ii transcription machinery suppress the hyperrecombination mutant hpr delta of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the soh, soh and soh mutants were isolated as suppressors of the temperature dependent growth of the hyperrecombination mutant hpr of saccharomyces cerevisiae. cloning and sequence analysis of these suppressor genes has unexpectedly shown them to code for components of the rna polymerase ii transcription complex. soh is identical to rpb, which encodes the second largest subunit of rna polymerase ii, and soh is the same as sua, encoding the yeast transcription initiation factor tfiib. soh encodes a novel kd protein with limited sequence similarity to rna polymerases. interestingly, soh not only interacts with factors involved in dna repair, but transcription as well. thus, the soh protein may serve to couple these two processes. the soh protein interacts with a dna repair protein, radp, in a two hybrid system assay. sohp may functionally interact with components of the rna polymerase ii complex as suggested from the synthetic lethality observed in soh rpb delta , soh soh (rpb), and soh soh (sua) double mutants. because mutations in soh, rpb and sua suppress the hyperrecombination phenotype of hpr mutants, this suggests a link between recombination in direct repeats and transcription.
