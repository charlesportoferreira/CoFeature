o glycosylation of axl/budp by pmtp is required for its stability, localization, and function in daughter cells.. . cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae choose bud sites in a manner that is dependent upon cell type. a and alpha cells select axial sites; a/alpha cells utilize bipolar sites. mutants specifically defective in axial budding were isolated from an alpha strain using pseudohyphal growth as an assay. we found that a and alpha mutants defective in the previously identified pmt gene exhibit unipolar, rather than axial budding. mother cells choose axial bud sites, but daughter cells do not. pmt encodes a protein mannosyl transferase (pmt) required for o linked glycosylation of some secretory and cell surface proteins (immervoll, t., m. gentzsch, and w. tanner. . yeast. . ). we demonstrate that axl/budp, which is required for the axial budding pattern, is an o linked glycoprotein and is incompletely glycosylated, unstable, and mislocalized in cells lacking pmt. overexpression of axl can partially restore proper bud site selection to pmt mutants. these data indicate that axl/budp is glycosylated by pmtp and that o linked glycosylation increases axl/ budp activity in daughter cells, apparently by enhancing its stability and promoting its localization to the plasma membrane.
