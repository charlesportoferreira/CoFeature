development of a yeast stop codon assay readily and generally applicable to human genes.. . we established a yeast based method to screen chain terminating mutations that is readily applicable to any gene of interest. based on the finding that to base long homologous sequences are sufficient for gap repair in vivo in yeast, we used a strategy to amplify a test gene fragment with addition of bp sequences homologous to both cut ends of a yeast expression vector, pmt. after co transformation with the amplified fragment and the linearized pmt, each yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) cell automatically forms a single copy circular plasmid (because of cen/ars), which expresses a test gene.ade chimera protein. when the reading frame of the test gene contains a nonsense or frameshift mutation, truncation of the chimera protein results in lack of ade activity, leading to formation of a red colony. by using a nested polymerase chain reaction using proofreading pfu polymerase to ensure specificity of the product, the assay achieved a low background (false positivity). we applied the assay to brca, apc, hmsh, and e cadherin genes, and successfully detected mutations in mrna and genomic dna. because this method universal stop codon assay requires only to days to screen a number of samples for any target gene, it may serve as a high throughput screening system of general utility for chain terminating mutations that are most prevalent in human genetic diseases.
