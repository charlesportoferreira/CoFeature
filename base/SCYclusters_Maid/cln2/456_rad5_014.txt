saccharomyces cerevisiae rad encoded dna repair protein contains dna helicase and zinc binding sequence motifs and affects the stability of simple repetitive sequences in the genome.. . rad (rev) mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae are sensitive to uv light and other dna damaging agents, and rad is in the rad epistasis group of dna repair genes. to unambiguously define the function of rad, we have cloned the rad gene, determined the effects of the rad deletion mutation on dna repair, dna damage induced mutagenesis, and other cellular processes, and analyzed the sequence of rad encoded protein. our genetic studies indicate that rad functions primarily with rad in error free postreplication repair. we also show that rad affects the rate of instability of poly(gt) repeat sequences. genomic poly(gt) sequences normally change length at a rate of about ( ); this rate is approximately fold lower in the rad deletion mutant than in the corresponding isogenic wild type strain. rad encodes a protein of , amino acids of m(r) ,, and it contains several interesting sequence motifs. all seven conserved domains found associated with dna helicases are present in rad. rad also contains a cysteine rich sequence motif that resembles the corresponding sequences found in other proteins, including those encoded by the dna repair gene rad and the rag gene required for immunoglobin gene arrangement. a leucine zipper motif preceded by a basic region is also present in rad. the cysteine rich region may coordinate the binding of zinc; this region and the basic segment might constitute distinct dna binding domains in rad. possible roles of rad putative atpase/dna helicase activity in dna repair and in the maintenance of wild type rates of instability of simple repetitive sequences are discussed.
