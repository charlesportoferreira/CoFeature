characterization of a dominant negative mutant of the cell cycle ubiquitin conjugating enzyme cdc.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc gene encodes a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that is required for the cell cycle g/s transition. we show here that a dominant negative cdc protein is generated by simultaneously replacing both cys and leu with ser residues. cys is an essential catalytic residue that forms a transient thiol ester with ubiquitin during catalysis, and leu is highly conserved among all known ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. mutants that encode either an alanine or a serine at one or both of these two positions are inactive. of these eight mutants, overexpression of cdc cs,ls in wild type strains was found to block cell growth. although cells overexpressing cdc cs,ls do not exhibit the characteristic multibudded phenotype of cdc temperature sensitive or null mutants, this blockade is relieved by simultaneous overxpression of wild type cdc. purified cdc cs,ls protein can be shown to inhibit in vitro ubiquitination of the cdc specific substrate, cln protein. we suggest that cdc cs,ls selectively sequesters a subset of cdc substrates or regulators. these findings have implications for the structure/function relationships of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and suggest a general method for identifying components and substrates of specific ubiquitination pathways of eukaryotes.
