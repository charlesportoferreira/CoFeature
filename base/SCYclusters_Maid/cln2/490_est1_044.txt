a mutant with a defect in telomere elongation leads to senescence in yeast.. . we describe a general assay designed to detect mutants of yeast that are defective for any of several aspects of telomere function. using this assay, we have isolated a mutant that displays a progressive decrease in telomere length as well as an increased frequency of chromosome loss. this mutation defines a new gene, designated est (for ever shorter telomeres). null alleles of est are not immediately inviable; instead, they have a senescence phenotype, due to the gradual loss of sequences essential for telomere function, leading to a progressive decrease in chromosomal stability and subsequent cell death.
