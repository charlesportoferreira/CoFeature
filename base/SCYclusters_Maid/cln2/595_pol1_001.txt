genomic instability induced by mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae pol.. . mutations of chromosome replication genes can be one of the early events that promote genomic instability. among genes that are involved in chromosomal replication, dna polymerase alpha is essential for initiation of replication and lagging strand synthesis. here we examined the effect of two mutations in s. cerevisiae pol, pol and pol , on a microsatellite (gt)() tract. the pol mutation elevated the mutation rate fold by altering sequences both inside and downstream of the (gt)() tract, whereas the pol mutation increased the mutation rate fold by predominantly altering sequences downstream of the (gt)() tract in a rad dependent manner. in a rad null mutant background pol and pol also exhibited different plasmid and chromosome loss phenotypes. deletions of mismatch repair (mmr) genes induce a differential synergistic increase in the mutation rates of pol and pol . these findings suggest that perturbations of dna replication in these two pol mutants are caused by different mechanisms, resulting in various types of mutations. thus, mutations of pol can induce a variety of mutator phenotypes and can be a source of genomic instability in cells.
