cdcp. a single strand telomeric dna binding protein with a dual role in yeast telomere maintenance.. . the cdc gene has previously been implicated in the maintenance of telomere integrity in saccharomyces cerevisiae. with the use of two classes of mutations, here it is shown that cdc has two discrete roles at the telomere. the cdc est mutation perturbs a function required in vivo for telomerase regulation but not in vitro for enzyme activity, whereas cdc ts defines a separate essential role at the telomere. in vitro, purified cdcp binds to single strand yeast telomeric dna. therefore, cdcp is a telomere binding protein required to protect the telomere and mediate access of telomerase to the chromosomal terminus.
