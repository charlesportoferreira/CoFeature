cleavage specificity of saccharomyces cerevisiae flap endonuclease suggests a double flap structure as the cellular substrate.. . flap endonuclease (fen) is a structure specific nuclease that cleaves substrates containing unannealed ' flaps during okazaki fragment processing. cleavage removes the flap at or near the point of annealing. the preferred substrate for archaeal fen or the ' nuclease domains of bacterial dna polymerases is a double flap structure containing a ' tail on the upstream primer adjacent to the ' flap. we report that fen in saccharomyces cerevisiae (radp) exhibits a similar specificity. cleavage was most efficient when the upstream primer contained a nucleotide ' tail as compared with the fully annealed upstream primer traditionally tested. the site of cleavage was exclusively at a position one nucleotide into the annealed region, allowing human dna ligase i to seal all resulting nicks. in contrast, a portion of the products from traditional flap substrates is not ligated. the ' oh of the upstream primer is not critical for double flap recognition, because radp is tolerant of modifications. however, the positioning of the ' nucleotide defines the site of cleavage. we have tested substrates having complementary tails that equilibrate to many structures by branch migration. fen only cleaved those containing a nucleotide ' tail. equilibrating substrates containing ribonucleotides at the end of the ' flap simulates the situation in vivo. radp cleaves this substrate in the expected nucleotide ' tail configuration. overall, these results suggest that the double flap substrate is formed and cleaved during eukaryotic dna replication in vivo.
