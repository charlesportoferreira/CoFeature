regulation of pcdc tyrosine phosphorylation is not required for entry into mitosis in s. cerevisiae.. . progression from g to m phase in eukaryotes requires activation of a protein kinase composed of pcdc/cdc associated with g specific cyclins. in some organisms the activation of the kinase at the g/m boundary is due to dephosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue at position (y) of the cdc protein. here we report that in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, pcdc also undergoes cell cycle regulated dephosphorylation on an equivalent tyrosine residue (y). however, in contrast to previous observations in s. pombe, xenopus and mammalian cells, dephosphorylation of y is not required for the activation of the cdc/cyclin kinase. furthermore, mutation of this tyrosine residue does not affect dependence of mitosis on dna synthesis nor does it abolish g arrest induced by dna damage. our data imply that regulated phosphorylation of this tyrosine residue is not the 'universal' means by which the onset of mitosis is determined. we propose that there are other unidentified controls that regulate entry into mitosis.
