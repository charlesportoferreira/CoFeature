saccharomyces cerevisiae flap endonuclease uses flap equilibration to maintain triplet repeat stability.. . flap endonuclease (fen) is a central component of okazaki fragment maturation in eukaryotes. genetic analysis of saccharomyces cerevisiae fen (rad) also reveals its important role in preventing trinucleotide repeat (tnr) expansion. in humans such expansion is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. in vitro, fen can inhibit tnr expansion by employing its endonuclease activity to compete with dna ligase i. here we employed two yeast fen nuclease mutants, rad gs and rad gd, to further define the mechanism by which fen prevents tnr expansion. using a yeast artificial chromosome system that can detect both tnr instability and fragility, we demonstrate that the gd but not the gs mutation increases both the expansion and fragility of a ctg tract in vivo. in vitro, the gd nuclease is proficient in cleaving a fixed nonrepeat double flap; however, it exhibits severely impaired cleavage of both nonrepeat and ctg containing equilibrating flaps. in contrast, wild type fen and the gs mutant exhibit more efficient cleavage on an equilibrating flap than on a fixed ctg flap. the degree of tnr expansion and the amount of chromosome fragility observed in the mutant strains correlate with the severity of defective flap cleavage in vitro. we present a model to explain how flap equilibration and the unique tracking mechanism of fen can collaborate to remove tnr flaps and prevent repeat expansion.
