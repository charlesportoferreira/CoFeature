the saccharomyces cerevisiae msh protein specifically binds to duplex oligonucleotides containing mismatched dna base pairs and insertions.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes four proteins, msh, msh, msh, msh, that show strong amino acid sequence similarity to muts, a central component of the bacterial muthls mismatch repair system. muts has been shown to recognize base pair mismatches in dna in vitro. previous studies have suggested that msh is the major mismatch recognition protein in yeast. in this study, the kd msh polypeptide was overexpressed and purified to analyze its dna binding properties. this analysis demonstrated that msh can bind selectively to duplex oligonucleotide substrates containing a g/t mismatch, to nucleotide insertion mismatches, and palindromic ( to nucleotide) insertion mismatches. a general trend was that the affinity of msh for substrate was proportional to the size of the insertion mispair present (+ pal, + pal &gt; + &gt; + &gt; gt, +, +, +, +). kinetic studies indicated that the specificity of msh to mismatch substrates was a function of its ability to form stable complexes with mispair containing duplex dnas. these complexes decayed more slowly than msh complexes formed with homoduplex dna.
