regulation of rad by the atm like kinases mec and tel in yeast cell cycle checkpoint pathways.. . mutants of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) homolog mec/sad/esr were identified that could live only if the rad/sad checkpoint kinase was overproduced. mec and a structurally related gene, tel, have overlapping functions in response to dna damage and replication blocks that in mutants can be provided by overproduction of rad. both mec and tel were found to control phosphorylation of radp in response to dna damage. these results indicate that rad is a signal transducer in the dna damage and replication checkpoint pathways and functions downstream of two members of the atm lipid kinase family. because several members of this pathway are conserved among eukaryotes, it is likely that a rad related kinase will function downstream of the human atm gene product and play an important role in the mammalian response to dna damage.
