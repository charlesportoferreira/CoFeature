mutation of msh in endometrial cancer and evidence for its functional role in heteroduplex repair.. . many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements. although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four dna mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) kindreds, many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes. it is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability. in yeast, mutations in several genes, including rth and msh, cause microsatellite instability. thus, we screened endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in fen (the human homolog of rth) and in msh (refs ). although we found no fen mutations, a frameshift mutation in msh was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line. extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of dna substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides. introducing chromosome , encoding the msh gene, into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites. extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides, but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides. a subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in hhua cells, a missense mutation in the msh gene. together the data suggest that the msh gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre mutational intermediates, its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and, as in yeast, msh and msh are partially redundant for mismatch repair.
