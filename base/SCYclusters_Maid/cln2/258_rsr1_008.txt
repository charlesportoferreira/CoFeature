isolation and characterization of the krev gene, a novel member of ras superfamily in neurospora crassa. involvement in sexual cycle progression.. . genes belonging to the ras superfamily encode low molecular weight gtp/gdp binding proteins that are highly conserved in wide variety of organisms. we used the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to isolate a novel member of the ras superfamily from the filamentous fungus neurospora crassa and obtained a mammalian krev homolog. we named the gene krev and analyzed its structure and function. the krev gene encodes a polypeptide of amino acids, which is nearly % homologous to the mammalian krev p. the krev gene product (krev) is functionally analogous to mammalian krev p and rsrp/budp, a krev homolog from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. gal driven expression of krev in a wild type yeast strain resulted in a random budding pattern, as did its mammalian counterpart krev p. we disrupted the krev gene by rip (repeat induced point mutation), but the krev disruptants showed no abnormalities. by in vitro mutagenesis, we constructed several mutant krev genes (gv, at, and da) which mimic constitutively active mutants of ha ras, and the krev (kn) mutant which is analogous to a dominant negative mutant of ha ras. each mutant gene was introduced into the wild type strain and the phenotypes were analyzed. we could not observe any difference in vegetative growth between these transformants. when each strain was used as the female in mating tests, the development of perithecia from protoperithecia was inhibited in all cases. the results indicate that the krev gene may be involved in sexual cycle progression.
