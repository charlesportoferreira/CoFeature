stimulation of eukaryotic flap endonuclease activities by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) is independent of its in vitro interaction via a consensus pcna binding region.. . interaction between human flap endonuclease (hfen ) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) represents a good model for interactions between multiple functional proteins involved in dna metabolic pathways. a region of conserved amino acid residues (residues gln through lys ) in the c terminus of human fen (hfen ) was shown to be responsible for the interaction with pcna. our current study indicates that amino acid residues in hfen (leu , asp , phe , and phe ) are critical for human pcna (hpcna) interaction. a conserved pcna interaction motif in various proteins from assorted species has been defined as q()x()x()(l/i)()x()x()f()(f/y)(), although our results fail to implicate q() (gln in hfen ) as a crucial residue. surprisingly, all hfen mutants, including la, da, fa, and fa, retained hpcna mediated stimulation of both exo and flap endonuclease activities. furthermore, our in vitro assay showed that hpcna failed to bind to the scrad (yeast homolog of fen ) nuclease. however, its nuclease activities were significantly enhanced in the presence of hpcna. four additional saccharomyces cerevisiae scrad mutants, including multiple alanine mutants and a deletion mutant of the entire pcna binding region, were constructed to confirm this result. all of these mutants retained pcna driven nuclease activity stimulation. we therefore conclude that stimulation of eukaryotic hfen nuclease activities by pcna is independent of its in vitro interaction via the pcna binding region.
