estp as a cell cycle regulated activator of telomere bound telomerase.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomerase components estp, tlc rna, estp, and estp are thought to form a complex that acts late during chromosome replication (s phase) upon recruitment by cdcp, a telomeric dna binding protein. consistent with this model, we show that estp, estp, and cdcp are telomere associated at this time. however, estp, but not estp, also binds telomeres before late s phase. the cdc allele has been proposed to be defective in recruitment, yet estp and estp telomere association persists in cdc cells. these findings suggest a model in which estp binds telomeres late in s phase and interacts with cdcp to convert inactive, telomere bound estp to an active form.
