cdc. an essential gene that prevents telomere elongation in yeast.. . the cdc gene product performs an essential stage specific function during the saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. when cdc strains are grown at the maximum permissive temperature, recombination is induced preferentially in the genetic interval of the chromosome closest to the telomere. telomeres are longer in cdc strains than in cdc strains at the permissive temperature because of addition of sequence near or in the poly (c a) telomeric dna and become even longer when cells are propagated at elevated temperatures. the mitotic recombination events require rad function, but telomere growth does not. long telomeres are maintained for many generations when crossed into a cdc+ background, suggesting that telomere length is largely conserved during replication. the altered telomere length phenotype of cdc mutations is recessive and coreverts and cosegregates with the temperature sensitive lethal phenotype.
