the sequence of a . kb dna fragment from the left arm of yeast chromosome xiv reveals leu, met, pol, ras, and six new open reading frames.. . the nucleotide sequence of a fragment of bp from the left arm of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome xiv has been determined. analysis of the sequence revealed open reading frames (orfs) longer than bp, four of which correspond to the previously identified genes leu, met, pol and ras. one putative protein, n, shares considerable homology (% identity) with a hypothetical protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome xv as well as with human ocrl protein (% identity), involved in lowe's syndrome. n contains ten predicted transmembrane segments and is similar to another putative protein (ykl) from yeast.
