cloning and characterization of the schizosaccharomyces pombe dna ligase gene cdc.. . the schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc gene has been cloned by complementation of the cdc mutant coding for temperature sensitive dna ligase. an allele specific suppressor active only in the presence of a high osmotic pressure was also isolated. the cloned cdc gene failed to complement the analogous dna ligase mutation, cdc, in saccharomyces cerevisiae, although the reverse complementation was successful [barker and johnston, eur. j. biochem. () ]. the cdc gene specifies a . kb transcript.
