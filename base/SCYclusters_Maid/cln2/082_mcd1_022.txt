degradation of a cohesin subunit by the n end rule pathway is essential for chromosome stability.. . cohesion between sister chromatids is established during dna replication and depends on a protein complex called cohesin. at the metaphase anaphase transition in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the esp encoded protease separin cleaves scc, a subunit of cohesin with a relative molecular mass of , (mr k). the resulting k carboxy terminal fragment of scc bears an amino terminal arginine a destabilizing residue in the n end rule. here we show that the scc fragment is short lived (t/ approximately min), being degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome dependent n end rule pathway. overexpression of a long lived derivative of the scc fragment is lethal. in ubrdelta cells, which lack the n end rule pathway, we found a highly increased frequency of chromosome loss. the bulk of increased chromosome loss in ubrdelta cells is caused by metabolic stabilization of the esp produced scc fragment. this fragment is the first physiological substrate of the n end rule pathway that is targeted through its n terminal residue. a number of yeast proteins bear putative cleavage sites for the esp separin, suggesting other physiological substrates and functions of the n end rule pathway.
