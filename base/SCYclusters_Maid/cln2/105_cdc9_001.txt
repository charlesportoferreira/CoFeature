nua subunit yng function in intra s phase dna damage response.. . while regulated transcription requires acetylation of histone n terminal tails to promote an open chromatin conformation, a similar role for histone acetylation in dna replication and/or repair remains to be established. cells lacking the nua subunit yng are viable but critically deficient for genome wide nucleosomal histone h acetylation. we found that yng mutants are specifically sensitized to dna damage in s phase induced by cdc or cdc mutations, hydroxyurea, camptothecin, or methylmethane sulfonate (mms). in yng, mms treatment causes a persistent mec dependent intra s phase checkpoint delay characterized by slow dna repair. restoring h acetylation with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin a promotes checkpoint recovery. in turn, mutants lacking the histone h specific acetyltransferase gcn are similarly sensitive to intra s phase dna damage. the inviability of gcn yng double mutants suggests overlapping roles for h and h acetylation in dna replication and repair. paradoxically, haploid yng mutants do not tolerate mutations in genes important for nonhomologous end joining repair yet remain proficient for homologous recombination. our results implicate nucleosomal histone acetylation in maintaining genomic integrity during chromosomal replication.
