control over the onset of dna synthesis in fission yeast.. . the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe has been used to identify gene functions required for the cell to become committed to the mitotic cell cycle and to initiate the processes leading to chromosome replication in s phase. two gene functions cdc and cdc must be executed for the cell to traverse 'start' and proceed from g into s phase. before the completion of these two functions the cell is in an uncommitted state and can undergo alternative developmental fates such as conjugation. a third gene, suc, has also been identified whose product may interact directly with that of cdc at 'start'. the molecular functions of the genes involved in the completion of 'start' have been investigated. the cdc gene has been shown to be a protein kinase, suggesting that phosphorylation may be involved in the control over the transition from g into s phase. the biochemical functions of the cdc and suc gene products have not yet been elucidated. a control at 'start' has also been shown to exist in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. traverse of 'start' requires the execution of the cdc gene function. the cdc and cdc gene products (lower case letters represent genes of schizosaccharomyces pombe, and capital letters genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae) are functionally homologous, suggesting that the processes involved in traverse of 'start' are highly conserved. an analogous control may also exist in the g period of mammalian cells, suggesting that the 'start' control step, after which cells become committed to the mitotic cell cycle, may have been conserved through evolution.
