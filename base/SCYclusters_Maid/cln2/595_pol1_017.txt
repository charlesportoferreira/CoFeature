mutations in pol increase the mitotic instability of tandem inverted repeats in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . tandem inverted repeats (tirs or hairpins) of and base pair unit lengths are unstable mitotically in yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae). tir instability results from deletions that remove part or all of the presumed hairpin structure from the chromosome. at least one deletion endpoint is always at or near the base of the hairpin, and almost all of the repaired junctions occur within short direct sequence repeats of to base pairs. the frequency of this event, which we call &quot;hairpin excision,&quot; is influenced by chromosomal position, length of the inverted repeats, and the distance separating the repeat units; increasing the distance between the inverted repeats as little as base pairs increases their chromosomal stability. the frequency of excision is not affected by representative rad mutations, but is influenced by mutations in certain genes affecting dna synthesis. in particular, mutations in pol/cdc, the gene that encodes the large subunit of dna polymerase i, increase the frequency of hairpin deletions significantly, implicating this protein in the normal maintainance of genomic tirs.
