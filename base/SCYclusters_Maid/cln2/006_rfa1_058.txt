a mutation in the gene encoding the saccharomyces cerevisiae single stranded dna binding protein rfa stimulates a rad independent pathway for direct repeat recombination.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, recombination between direct repeats is synergistically reduced in rad rad double mutants, suggesting that the two genes define alternate recombination pathways. using a classical genetic approach, we searched for suppressors of the recombination defect in the double mutant. one mutation that restores wild type levels of recombination was isolated. cloning by complementation and subsequent physical and genetic analysis revealed that it maps to raf. this locus encodes the large subunit of the single stranded dna binding protein complex, rp a, which is conserved from s. cerevisiae to humans. the rfa mutation on its own causes a fold increase in direct repeat recombination. however, unlike most other hyperrecombination mutations, the elevated levels in rfa mutants occur independently of rad function. additionally, rfa mutant strains grow slowly, are uv sensitive, and exhibit decreased levels of heteroallelic recombination. dna sequence analysis of rfa revealed a missense mutation that alters a conserved residue of the protein (aspartic acid to tyrosine [dy]). biochemical analysis suggests that this defect results in decreased levels of rp a in mutant strains. overexpression of the mutant subunit completely suppresses the uv sensitivity and partially suppresses the recombination phenotype. we propose that the defective complex fails to interact properly with components of the repair, replication, and recombination machinery. further, this may permit the bypass of the recombination defect of rad rad mutants by activating an alternative single stranded dna degradation pathway.
