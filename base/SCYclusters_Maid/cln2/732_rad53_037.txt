linkage of atm to cell cycle regulation by the chk protein kinase.. . in response to dna damage and replication blocks, cells prevent cell cycle progression through the control of critical cell cycle regulators. we identified chk, the mammalian homolog of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad and schizosaccharomyces pombe cds protein kinases required for the dna damage and replication checkpoints. chk was rapidly phosphorylated and activated in response to replication blocks and dna damage; the response to dna damage occurred in an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) dependent manner. in vitro, chk phosphorylated cdcc on serine , a site known to be involved in negative regulation of cdcc. this is the same site phosphorylated by the protein kinase chk, which suggests that, in response to dna damage and dna replicational stress, chk and chk may phosphorylate cdcc to prevent entry into mitosis.
