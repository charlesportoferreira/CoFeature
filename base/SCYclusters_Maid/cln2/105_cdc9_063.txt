increased spontaneous mitotic segregation in mms sensitive mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitive mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae belonging to four different complementation groups, when homozygous, increase the rate of spontaneous mitotic segregation to canavanine resistance from heterozygous sensitive (canr/+) diploids by to fold. the mms mutant is mms and x ray sensitive and increases the rate of spontaneous mitotic segregation fold. the mms and mms mutants are sensitive to x rays and uv, respectively, in addition of mms, and increase the rate of spontaneous mitotic segregation by fold and fold, respectively. the mutant mms is sensitive to mms, x rays and uv and increases the rate of spontaneous mitotic segregation fold.
