distinct function of conserved amino acids in the fingers of saccharomyces cerevisiae dna polymerase alpha.. . structural differences between class a and b dna polymerases suggest that the motif b region, a wall of the catalytic pocket, may have evolved differentially in the two polymerase families. this study examines the function of the motif b residues in saccharomyces cerevisiae dna polymerase alpha (pol alpha). effects of the mutations were determined by biochemical analysis and genetic complementation of a yeast strain carrying a temperature sensitive pol alpha mutant. many conserved residues were viable with a variety of substitutions. among them, mutations at asn or tyr conferred up to fold higher colony formation frequency in a ura forward mutation assay, and fold higher trp reversion frequency was observed for yp in yeast. purified yp was as accurate as wild type in dna synthesis but approximately fold less processive and fold less active in vitro. therefore, yp may increase the frequency of mutant colony formation because of its low level of dna polymerase activity in yeast. mutations at lys or gly were not viable, which is consistent with the observation that mutants with substitutions at gly have strongly reduced catalytic activity in vitro. gly may provide a space for the nascent base pair and thus may play an essential function in s. cerevisiae dna pol alpha. these results suggest that class b dna polymerases have a unique structure in the catalytic pocket, which is distinct from the corresponding region in class a dna polymerases.
