repair of dna loops involves dna mismatch and nucleotide excision repair proteins.. . a number of enzymes recognize and repair dna lesions. the dna mismatch repair system corrects base base mismatches and small loops, whereas the nucleotide excision repair system removes pyrimidine dimers and other helix distorting lesions. dna molecules with mismatches or loops can arise as a consequence of heteroduplex formation during meiotic recombination. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, repair of mismatches results in gene conversion or restoration, and failure to repair the mismatch results in post meiotic segregation (pms). the ratio of gene conversion to pms events reflects the efficiency of dna repair. by examining the pms patterns in yeast strains heterozygous for a mutant allele with a base pair insertion, we find that the repair of base loops involves msh (a dna mismatch repair protein) and rad (a protein required for nucleotide excision repair).
