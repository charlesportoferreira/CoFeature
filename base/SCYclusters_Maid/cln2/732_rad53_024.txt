nucleotide excision repair in yeast.. . in nucleotide excision repair (ner) in eukaryotes, dna is incised on both sides of the lesion, resulting in the removal of a fragment approximately nucleotides long. this is followed by repair synthesis and ligation. the proteins encoded by the various yeast ner genes have been purified, and the incision reaction reconstituted in vitro. this reaction requires the damage binding factors rad, rpa, and the rad rad complex, the transcription factor tfiih which contains the two dna helicases rad and rad, essential for creating a bubble structure, and the two endonucleases, the rad rad complex and rad, which incise the damaged dna strand on the ' and ' side of the lesion, respectively. addition of the rad rad complex to this reconstituted system stimulates the incision reaction many fold. the various ner proteins exist in vivo as part of multiprotein subassemblies which have been named nefs (nucleotide excision repair factors). rad and rad rad form one subassembly called nef, the rad rad complex is named nef, rad and tfiih constitute nef, and the rad rad complex is called nef. although much has been learned from yeast about the function of ner genes and proteins in eukaryotes, the underlying mechanisms by which damage is recognized, nefs are assembled at the damage site, and the dna is unwound and incised, remain to be elucidated.
