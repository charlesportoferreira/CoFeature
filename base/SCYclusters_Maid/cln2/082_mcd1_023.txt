nxp , a human protein related to rad/scc/mcd, is a component of the nuclear matrix.. . nuclear matrix is a complex intranuclear network supposed to be involved in the various nuclear functions. in order to identify the nuclear matrix proteins, we isolated a cdna clone from a human placenta cdna library. this clone was partially represented a known cdna clone ha. ha encoded a amino acid peptide, which we designated nxp . nxp was related to yeast rad/scc/mcd, xenopus xrad, and mouse pw, and identical with hrspa isolated from a human testis cdna library. we developed a polyclonal antibody to the purified nxp bacterially expressed as a fusion protein with gst. western blot analysis with anti nxp polyclonal antibody showed nuclear matrix localization of nxp in hela cells. indirect immunofluorescence staining also showed nuclear and nuclear matrix localization of the nxp . results of in vitro binding assays employing nuclear matrix preparations indicated that the n terminal region ( amino acid) of nxp has an important role in nuclear matrix distribution. copyright academic press.
