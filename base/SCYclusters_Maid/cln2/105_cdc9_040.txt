bleomycin induced dna repair by saccharomyces cerevisiae atp dependent polydeoxyribonucleotide ligase.. . in contrast to ligase deficient (cdc) saccharomyces cerevisiae, which did not rejoin bleomycin induced dna breaks, ligase proficient (cdc) yeast cells eliminated approximately % of dna breaks within to min after treatment. experimental conditions restricted enzymatic removal of the unusual ' phosphoglycolate termini in dna cleaved by bleomycin and involved doses producing equivalent numbers of dna breaks or doses producing equivalent killing.
