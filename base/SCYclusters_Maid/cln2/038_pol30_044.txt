staurosporine sensitive protein phosphorylation is required for postreplication dna repair in human cells.. . dna repair is an important factor of stability of pro and eukaryotic genomes which plays a central role in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. genetic control of nucleotide excision repair (ner) in mammalian cells is well studied, but little is known about molecular mechanisms of postreplication repair (prr) which allows bypass of base lesions in template strands after dna replication. in saccharomyces cerevisiae prr is controlled by the radrad pathway which involves pol gene encoding proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), and in human cells pcna is known to be closely associated with the newly replicated chromatin where prr probably takes place. in uv irradiated human cells distinct pcna foci may be detected in some cells which accumulate phosphorylated breast cancer susceptibility protein brca and another protein bard. human pcna is also known to be phosphorylated after uv irradiation. in this study we found that the known inhibitor of protein kinases staurosporine supresses prr in ner deficient cells which is consistent with the view that brca and pcna are required for prr. we also have shown that the distinct pcna foci in uv irradiated ner deficient cells are actually associated with the newly replicated chromatin. since rad protein is not essential for normal dna replication and directly controls prr in yeast, we analysed whether this protein as well as its human homologs (hra and hrb) have common domains with brca and bard. it is found that hra has a subregion of homology to bard and hra to brca. taken together the results indicate that brca and bard may be involved in prr in human cells.
