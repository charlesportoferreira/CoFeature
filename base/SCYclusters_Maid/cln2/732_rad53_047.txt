cdc. a putative nucleotide binding protein required for cell cycle progression that has homology to subunits of replication factor c.. . to investigate the means by which a cell regulates the progression of the mitotic cell cycle, we characterized cdc, a mutation that causes saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to arrest before mitosis. cdc encodes a kda basic protein with significant homology to a human protein that binds dna (po ga) and to three subunits of human replication factor c (also called activator ). the hypothesis that cdcp is involved in dna metabolism is supported by the observations that (i) levels of mitotic recombination suggest elevated rates of dna damage in cdc mutants and (ii) the cell cycle arrest observed in cdc mutants is alleviated by the dna damage checkpoint mutations rad, mec, and mec. the predicted amino acid sequence of cdcp contains gtpase consensus sites, and mutations in these regions cause a conditional cell cycle arrest. taken together, these observations suggest that the essential cdc gene may encode the large subunit of yeast replication factor c.
