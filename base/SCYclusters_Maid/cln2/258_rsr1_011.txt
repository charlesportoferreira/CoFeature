influence of guanine nucleotides on complex formation between ras and cdc proteins.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc gene and closely homologous genes in other eukaryotes encode guanine nucleotide exchange factors for ras proteins. we have determined the minimal region of the budding yeast cdc gene capable of activity in vivo. the region required for full biological activity is approximately residues and contains two segments homologous to other proteins. one found in both ras specific exchange factors and the more distant bud and lte proteins, and a smaller segment of amino acids found only in the ras specific exchange factors. when expressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein, this region of cdc was found to be a potent catalyst of gdp gtp exchange on yeast ras as well as human ph ras but inactive in promoting exchange on the ras related proteins ypt and rsr. the cdc fusion protein catalyzed replacement of gdp bound to ras with gtp (activation) more efficiently than that of the reverse reaction of replacement of gtp for gdp (deactivation), consistent with prior genetic analysis of cdc which indicated a positive role in the activation of ras. to more directly study the physical interaction of cdc and ras proteins, we developed a protein protein binding assay. we determined that cdc binds tightly to ras protein only in the absence of guanine nucleotides. this higher affinity of cdc for the nucleotide free form than for either the gdp or gtp bound form suggests that cdc catalyzes exchange of guanine nucleotides bound to ras proteins by stabilization of the transitory nucleotide free state.
