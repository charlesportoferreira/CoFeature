the budding yeast rad checkpoint complex. chaperone proteins are required for its function.. . rad functions in the dna damage checkpoint pathway of saccharomyces cerevisiae. in whole cell extracts, rad is found in large, soluble complexes, which have functions in amplifying the checkpoint signal. the two main soluble forms of rad complexes that are found in cells exposed to dna damaging treatments were purified to homogeneity. both of these rad complexes contain the ssa and/or ssa chaperone proteins, suggesting a function for these proteins in checkpoint regulation. consistent with this possibility, genetic experiments indicate redundant functions for ssa and ssa in survival, g/m checkpoint regulation, and phosphorylation of both rad and rad after irradiation with ultraviolet light. ssa and ssa can now be considered as novel checkpoint proteins that are likely to be required for remodelling rad complexes during checkpoint pathway activation.
