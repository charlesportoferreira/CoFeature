ultraviolet induced reversion of cyc alleles in radiation sensitive strains of yeast. ii. rev mutant strains.. . the range of specificity of the rev mutation, an allele that reduces the frequency of ochre revertants induced by uv in saccharomyces cerevisiae (lemontt a), has been investigated by examining its influence on the reversion of eleven well defined and contrasting cyc mutations. we have shown, in support of a suggestion of lemontt (a), that the rev gene product is concerned only with the reversion of ochre alleles; it plays virtually no role in the reversion of amber, missense or frameshift mutations. we have also shown that its effect is specific and confined to only some highly revertible ochre alleles. the rev gene product appears to enhance reversion at these sites by facilitating the conversion of two otherwise nonmutagenic photo products into a single premutational lesion. uv induced killing of rev strains was found to be significantly greater on fermentable rather than on nonfermentable media.
