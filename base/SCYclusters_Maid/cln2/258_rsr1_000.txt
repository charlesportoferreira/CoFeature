interaction between a ras and a rho gtpase couples selection of a growth site to the development of cell polarity in yeast.. . polarized cell growth requires the coupling of a defined spatial site on the cell cortex to the apparatus that directs the establishment of cell polarity. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ras family gtpase rsrp/budp and its regulators select the proper site for bud emergence on the cell cortex. the rho family gtpase cdcp and its associated proteins then establish an axis of polarized growth by triggering an asymmetric organization of the actin cytoskeleton and secretory apparatus at the selected bud site. we explored whether a direct linkage exists between the rsrp/budp and cdcp gtpases. here we show specific genetic interactions between rsr/bud and particular cdc mutants defective in polarity establishment. we also show that cdcp coimmunoprecipitated with rsrp/budp from yeast extracts. in vitro studies indicated a direct interaction between rsrp/budp and cdcp, which was enhanced by cdcp, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for cdcp. our findings suggest that cdcp interacts directly with rsrp/budp in vivo, providing a novel mechanism by which direct contact between a ras family gtpase and a rho family gtpase links the selection of a growth site to polarity establishment.
