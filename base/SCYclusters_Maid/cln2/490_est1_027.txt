est and cdc as comediators of telomerase access.. . cdc and est are single strand telomeric dna binding proteins that contribute to telomere replication in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. here it is shown that fusion of cdc to the telomerase associated est protein results in greatly elongated telomeres. fusion proteins consisting of mutant versions of cdc or est confer similar telomere elongation, indicating that close physical proximity can bypass telomerase defective mutations in either protein. fusing cdc directly to the catalytic core of telomerase allows stable telomere maintenance in the absence of est, consistent with a role for est in mediating telomerase access. telomere length homeostasis therefore is maintained in part by restricting access of telomerase to chromosome termini, but this limiting situation can be overcome by directly tethering telomerase to the telomere.
