a dna polymerase mutation that suppresses the segregation bias of an ars plasmid in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . yeast autonomously replicating sequence (ars) plasmids exhibit an unusual segregation pattern during mitosis. while the nucleus divides equally into mother and daughter cells, all copies of the ars plasmid will often remain in the mother cell. a screen was designed to isolate mutations that suppress this segregation bias. a plasmid with a weak ars (wars) that displayed an extremely high segregation bias was constructed. when cells were grown under selection for the wars plasmid, the resulting colonies grew slowly and had abnormal morphology. a spontaneous recessive mutation that restored normal colony morphology was identified. this mutation suppressed plasmid segregation bias, as indicated by the increased stability of the wars plasmid in the mutant cells even though the plasmid was present at a lower copy number. an ars plasmid was also more stable in mutant cells than in wild type cells. the wild type allele for this mutant gene was cloned and identified as pol delta (cdc). this gene encodes dna polymerase delta, which is essential for dna replication. these results indicate that dna polymerase delta plays some role in causing the segregation bias of ars plasmids.
