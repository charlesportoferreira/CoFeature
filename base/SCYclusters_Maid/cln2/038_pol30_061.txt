proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pol) mutations suppress cdc mutations and identify potential regions of interaction between the two encoded proteins.. . in addition to its role as a processivity factor in dna replication, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) may function in the regulation of cell cycle progression. we present genetic evidence that pcna interacts with the gene product of cdc, an essential nucleotide binding protein that encodes the large subunit of yeast replication factor c (k. fien and b. stillman, personal communication). mutations in pol (pcna) suppress cold sensitive alleles of cdc that contain mutations in or near nucleotide binding consensus domains, but they do not suppress a null allele. thus, it appears that pcna interacts with cdcp but cannot substitute for its function. pol mutations suppress additional phenotypes of cdc mutations, including the cold sensitivity that they were selected to suppress. this observation suggests an intimate association between pcna and cdcp. each of five independent pol mutants contains a unique single mutation that maps to a localized region on one face of the predicted three dimensional structure of pcna. this face identifies a region likely to be important for functional interaction between the cdc and pol gene products.
