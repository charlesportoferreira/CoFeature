rsp, a ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in degradation of the single stranded dna binding protein rfa in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, rad and rad are required for alternate pathways of mitotic recombination. double mutant strains exhibit a synergistic interaction that decreases direct repeat recombination rates dramatically. a mutation in rfa, the largest subunit of a single stranded dna binding protein complex (rp a), suppresses the recombination deficiency of rad rad strains (j. smith and r. rothstein, mol. cell. biol. . , ). previously, we hypothesized that this mutation, rfa dy, causes an increase in recombinogenic lesions as well as the activation of a rad independent recombination pathway. to identify gene(s) acting in this pathway, temperature sensitive (ts) mutations were screened for those that decrease recombination levels in a rad rad rfa dy strain. three mutants were isolated. each segregates as a single recessive gene. two are allelic to rsp, which encodes an essential ubiquitin protein ligase. one allele, rsp , contains two mutations within its open reading frame. the first mutation does not alter the amino acid sequence of rsp, but it decreases the amount of full length protein in vivo. the second mutation results in the substitution of a tryptophan with a leucine residue in the ubiquitination domain. in rsp mutants, the uv sensitivity of rfa dy is suppressed to the same level as in strains overexpressing rfa dy. measurement of the relative rate of protein turnover demonstrated that the half life of rfa dy in rsp mutants was extended to min compared to a min half life in wild type strains. we propose that rsp is involved in the degradation of rfa linking ubiquitination with the replication recombination machinery.
