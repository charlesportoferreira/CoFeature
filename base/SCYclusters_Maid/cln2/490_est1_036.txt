senescence mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae with a defect in telomere replication identify three additional est genes.. . the primary determinant for telomere replication is the enzyme telomerase, responsible for elongating the g rich strand of the telomere. the only component of this enzyme that has been identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae is the tlc gene, encoding the telomerase rna subunit. however, a yeast strain defective for the est gene exhibits the same phenotypes (progressively shorter telomeres and a senescence phenotype) as a strain deleted for tlc, suggesting that est encodes either a component of telomerase or some other factor essential for telomerase function. we designed a multitiered screen that led to the isolation of mutants that display the same phenotypes as est and tlc mutant strains. these mutations mapped to four complementation groups. the previously identified est gene and three additional genes, called est, est and est. cloning of the est gene demonstrated that it encodes a large, extremely basic novel protein with no motifs that provide clues as to function. epistasis analysis indicated that the four est genes function in the same pathway for telomere replication as defined by the tlc gene, suggesting that the est genes encode either components of telomerase or factors that positively regulate telomerase activity.
