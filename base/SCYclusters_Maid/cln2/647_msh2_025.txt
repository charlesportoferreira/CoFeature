microsatellite instability in yeast. dependence on the length of the microsatellite.. . one of the most common microsatellites in eukaryotes consists of tandem arrays [usually base pairs (bp) in length] of the dinucleotide gt. we examined the rates of instability for poly gt tracts of , , , and bp in wild type and mismatch repair deficient strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae. rates of instability increased more than two orders of magnitude as tracts increased in size from to bp in both wild type and msh strains. the types of alterations observed in long and short tracts in wild type strains were different in two ways. first, tracts &gt; or = bp had significantly more large deletions than tracts &lt; or = bp. second, for the and bp tracts, almost all events involving single repeats were additions; for the smaller tracts, both additions and deletions of single repeats were common.
