the rev gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. cloning and dna sequence.. . the rev gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned and sequenced; it contains an open reading frame of bp with a coding potential of amino acids. interruption of the chromosomal rev gene by integrating the ura gene coupled with partial deletion of the ' terminal region produced viable haploid rev delta mutants. this indicates that the rev gene is non essential for growth. the rev delta mutant is slightly more uv sensitive than strains carrying various rev alleles (rev , revx, rad , rad ). the putative rev protein is probably a globular protein containing a highly conserved nucleotide binding site and two zinc finger domains.
