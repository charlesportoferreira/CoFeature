highly stereoselective reagents for beta keto ester reductions by genetic engineering of baker's yeast.. . while whole cells of baker's yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) are a convenient biocatalytic reducing agent for a wide variety of carbonyl compounds, mixtures of stereoisomeric alcohols are often observed since the organism contains a large number of reductase enzymes with overlapping substrate specificities but differing stereoselectivities. we sought to improve the performance of baker's yeast for beta keto ester reductions by using recombinant dna techniques to alter the levels of three enzymes known to play important roles in these reactions (fatty acid synthase, fasp; aldo keto reductase, yprp; alpha acetoxy ketone reductase, grep). a complete set of &quot;first generation&quot; yeast strains that either lack or overexpress each of these three enzymes was created and tested for improvements in stereoselective reductions of a series of beta keto esters. on the basis of these results, multiply modified (&quot;second generation&quot;) strains were created that combined gene knockout and overexpression in single strains. in some cases, these additional modifications further improved the stereoselectivities of beta keto ester reductions, thereby making several beta hydroxy ester building blocks readily available by reactions that can be performed by nonspecialists. this work also revealed that additional yeast proteins participate in reducing beta keto esters, and further progress using this strategy will require either additional genetic manipulations or the expression of yeast reductases in hosts that lack enzymes with overlapping substrate specificity.
