mutations in spk/rad that specifically abolish checkpoint but not growth related functions.. . spk/rad/sad/mec encodes an essential protein kinase of saccharomyces cerevisiae and is required for the execution of checkpoint arrest at multiple stages of the cell cycle. we have isolated two mutant alleles of spk (spkka and spk ap) that are defective for checkpoint arrest functions but retain wild type levels of spk associated growth activity. both mutations occur within conserved regions of the kinase domain of spk resulting in a substantial reduction in the catalytic activity of spk. thus, while minimal levels of spk kinase activity are capable of supporting normal rates of growth, higher levels are required for checkpoint functions. in addition, using deletional analysis we have identified a region within the n terminus of spk outside of the conserved kinase domain that is required for checkpoint functions. interestingly, this region may be important in the regulation of spk kinase activity.
