interaction between a geminivirus replication protein and the plant sumoylation system.. . geminiviruses are small dna viruses that replicate in nuclei of infected plant cells after accumulation of host replication machinery. tomato golden mosaic virus (tgmv) and tomato yellow leaf curl sardinia virus (tylcsv) encode a protein, repac (or rep), that is essential for viral replication. rep/repac is an oligomeric protein that binds to double stranded dna, catalyzes cleavage and ligation of single stranded dna, and is sufficient for host induction. it also interacts with several host proteins, including the cell cycle regulator, retinoblastoma, and essential components of the cell dna replication machinery, like proliferating nuclear cell antigen (pcna) and rfc . to identify other cellular proteins that interact with rep/repac protein, a nicotiana benthamiana cdna library was screened with a yeast two hybrid assay. the host cell sumoylation enzyme, nbsce (n. benthamiana sumo conjugating enzyme, homolog to saccharomyces cerevisiae ubc), was found to interact specifically with repac. mapping studies localized the interaction to the n terminal half of repac. effects on geminivirus replication were observed in transgenic plants with altered levels of sumo, the substrate for ubc.
