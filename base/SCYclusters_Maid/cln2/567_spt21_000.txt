the spt and spt genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mutations in the spt and spt genes were originally isolated as suppressors of ty and ltr (delta) insertion mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the genes were shown to be required for normal transcription at a number of loci in yeast. now we have cloned, sequenced, mapped and mutagenized spt and spt. since the spt mutation used to clone spt resulted in very poor transformation efficiency, a novel method making use of the kar mutation was used. neither spt gene is essential for growth, and constructed null alleles cause phenotypes similar to those caused by spontaneous mutations in the genes. spt null alleles are strong suppressor mutations and cause extremely slow growth. certain spt spontaneous alleles are good suppressors but have a normal growth rate, suggesting that the spt protein may have two distinct functions. an amino acid sequence motif that is similar to the zn finger motif was found in spt. mutation of the second cys residue in this motif resulted in loss of complementation of the suppression phenotype but a normal growth rate. thus, this motif may reside in a part of the spt protein that is important for transcriptional regulation but not for normal growth. both the spt and spt proteins are relatively tolerant of large deletions; in both cases deletions of the c terminus resulted in at least partially functional proteins; also, a large internal deletion in spt was phenotypically wild type.
