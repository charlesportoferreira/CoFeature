the fha domain is a modular phosphopeptide recognition motif.. . fha domains are conserved sequences of amino acid residues found principally within eukaryotic nuclear proteins, but which also exist in certain prokaryotes. the fha domain is thought to mediate protein protein interactions, but its mode of action has yet to be elucidated. here, we show that the two highly divergent fha domains of saccharomyces cerevisiae radp, a protein kinase involved in cell cycle checkpoint control, possess phosphopeptide binding specificity. we also demonstrate that other fha domains bind peptides in a phospho dependent manner. these findings indicate that the fha domain is a phospho specific protein protein interaction motif and have important implications for mechanisms of intracellular signaling in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
