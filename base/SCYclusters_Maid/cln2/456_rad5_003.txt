saccharomyces cerevisiae rad influences the excision repair of dna minor groove adducts.. . nucleotide excision repair (ner) is the primary pathway for the removal of dna adducts that distort the double helix. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the rad epistasis group defines a more poorly characterized set of dna damage response pathways, believed to be distinct from ner. here we show that the elimination of the dna minor groove adducts formed by an important class of anticancer antibiotic (cc family) requires ner factors in s. cerevisiae. we also demonstrate that the elimination of this class of minor groove adduct from the active mfa gene depends upon functional rad and rad. this is most clear for the repair of adducts on the transcribed strand, where an absolute requirement for rad and rad was seen. further experiments revealed that a specific rad rad controlled subpathway, the rad branch, mediates these events. cells disrupted for rad are highly sensitive to this minor groove binding agent, and rad cells exhibit an in vivo adduct elimination defect indistinguishable from that seen in rad and rad cells as well as in ner defective cells. our results indicate that the rad subpathway may interact with ner factors during the repair of certain dna adducts.
