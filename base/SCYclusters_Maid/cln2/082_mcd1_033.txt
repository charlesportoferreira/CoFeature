the drosophila rad cohesin persists at the centromere region in mitosis.. . 'cohesin' is a highly conserved multiprotein complex thought to be the primary effector of sister chromatid cohesion in all eukaryotes. cohesin complexes in budding yeast hold sister chromatids together from s phase until anaphase, but in metazoans, cohesin proteins dissociate from chromosomes and redistribute into the whole cell volume during prophase, well before sister chromatids separate (reviewed in [,]). here we address this apparent anomaly by investigating the cell cycle dynamics of drad, the drosophila orthologue of the xenopus xrad and saccharomyces cerevisiae sccp/mcdp cohesins []. analysis of drad in s drosophila tissue culture cells and live embryos expressing a drad green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion revealed the presence of four distinct subcellular pools of drad. a cytoplasmic pool; a chromosome associated pool which dissociates from chromatin as chromosomes condense in prophase; a short lived centrosome associated pool present during metaphase anaphase; and a centromere proximal pool which remains bound to condensed chromosomes, is found along the junction of sister chromatids between kinetochores, and persists until the metaphase anaphase transition. we conclude that in drosophila, and possibly all metazoans, a minor pool of cohesin remains bound to centromere proximal chromatin after prophase and maintains sister chromatid cohesion until the metaphase anaphase transition.
