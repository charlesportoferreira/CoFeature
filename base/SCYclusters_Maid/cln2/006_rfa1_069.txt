an essential saccharomyces cerevisiae single stranded dna binding protein is homologous to the large subunit of human rp a.. . single stranded dna binding proteins (ssbs) are known to play a role in dna replication and recombination in prokaryotes. an ssb was previously purified from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. this ssb stimulated the activity of a cognate strand exchange protein (sep) in vitro suggesting a role in recombination. we have cloned and functionally analyzed the gene encoding this protein. dna sequencing of the cloned dna revealed a amino acid open reading frame with a coding potential for a mr , polypeptide. highly significant amino acid homology was detected between this s.cerevisiae gene and the mr , subunit polypeptide of human rp a, a cellular protein essential for sv dna replication in vitro. therefore, we named the s.cerevisiae gene rpa. rpa encodes an essential function in this organism as shown by tetrad analysis of heterozygous insertion mutants and is continuously required for mitotic growth. cells lacking rpa accumulate as multiply budded cells with a single nucleus suggesting a defect in dna replication.
