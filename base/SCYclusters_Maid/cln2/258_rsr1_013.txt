cytoskeletal interactions of rapb in platelets.. . we have presented evidence that rapb, a kda low molecular weight gtp binding protein, becomes associated with the cytoskeleton in thrombin activated platelets. the initial incorporation is very rapid and occurs as fast as we can measure it. thus, some rapb is associated with the cytoskeleton as fast as it is formed. the remainder of the rapb is incorporated more slowly. this biphasic incorporation of rapb is similar to the incorporation of gpiib/iiia into the cytoskeleton, but no interaction between gpiib/iiia and rapb could be demonstrated. phosphorylation of rapb by camp dependent protein kinase did not inhibit its association with the cytoskeleton. we conclude that rapb is one of an increasing number of proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton during cell activation. the function of rapb in the cytoskeleton is unclear at this time. however, it is possible to speculate on potential roles. there is growing evidence that low molecular weight g proteins participate in the formation of multi molecular aggregates. for example, prac promotes the assembly of a membrane associated complex composed of nadph oxidase, p, and p and this complex is important for activation of nadph oxidase in neutrophils. similarly, in yeast, bud, a homolog of rap, forms a complex with bud (a homolog of gdi), bemi, cdc, and cdc (a homolog of gk). this multi protein aggregate may be important in cytoskeletal structure in yeast. in platelets, radb, which is membrane associated, may promote the assembly of a complex of proteins during cell activation and may localize this complex to the plasma membrane.(abstract truncated at words)
