interaction of p reverse transcriptase from the saccharomyces cerevisiae retrotransposon ty with conformationally distinct nucleic acid duplexes.. . the kda reverse transcriptase (rt) domain of the ty pol open reading frame was purified and evaluated on conformationally distinct nucleic acid duplexes. purified enzyme migrated as a monomer by size exclusion chromatography. enzymatic footprinting indicate ty rt protects template nucleotides + through and primer nucleotides through . contrary to previous data with retroviral enzymes, a base pair region of the template primer duplex remained nuclease accessible. the c terminal portion of ty rt encodes a functional rnase h domain, although the hydrolysis profile suggests an increased spatial separation between the catalytic centers. despite conservation of catalytically important residues in the rnase h domain, fe(+) fails to replace mg(+) in the rnase h catalytic center for localized generation of hydroxyl radicals, again suggesting this domain may be structurally distinct from its retroviral counterparts. rnase h specificity was investigated using a model system challenging the enzyme to select the polypurine tract primer from within an rna/dna hybrid, extend this into (+) dna, and excise the primer from nascent dna. purified rt catalyzed each of these three steps but was almost inactive on a non polypurine tract rna primer. our studies provide the first detailed characterization of the enzymatic activities of a retrotransposon reverse transcriptase.
