nipp mediated interaction of protein phosphatase with cdcl, a regulator of pre mrna splicing and mitotic entry.. . nipp is a regulatory subunit of a species of protein phosphatase (pp) that co localizes with splicing factors in nuclear speckles. we report that the n terminal third of nipp largely consists of a forkhead associated (fha) protein interaction domain, a known phosphopeptide interaction module. a yeast two hybrid screening revealed an interaction between this domain and a human homolog (cdcl) of the fission yeast protein cdc, which is required for g()/m progression and pre mrna splicing. cdcl and nipp co localized in nuclear speckles in cos cells. furthermore, an interaction between cdcl, nipp, and pp in rat liver nuclear extracts could be demonstrated by co immunoprecipitation and/or co purification experiments. the binding of the fha domain of nipp to cdcl was dependent on the phosphorylation of cdcl, e.g. by cyclin e cdk. when expressed in cos or hela cells, the fha domain of nipp did not affect the number of cells in the g()/m transition. however, the fha domain blocked beta globin pre mrna splicing in nuclear extracts. a mutation in the fha domain that abolished its interaction with cdcl also canceled its anti splicing effects. we suggest that nipp either targets cdcl or an associated protein for dephosphorylation by pp or serves as an anchor for both pp and cdcl.
