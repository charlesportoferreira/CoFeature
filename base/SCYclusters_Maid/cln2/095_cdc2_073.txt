structure and function of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc gene encoding the large subunit of dna polymerase iii.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc mutants arrest in the s phase of the cell cycle when grown at the non permissive temperature, implicating this gene product as essential for dna synthesis. the cdc gene has been cloned from a yeast genomic library in vector yep by complementation of a cdc mutation. an open reading frame coding for a amino acid long protein with a calculated mol. wt of , was determined from the sequence. this putative protein shows significant homology with a class of eukaryotic dna polymerases exemplified by human dna polymerase alpha and herpes simplex virus dna polymerase. fractionation of extracts from cdc strains showed that these mutants lacked both the polymerase and proofreading ' ' exonuclease activity of dna polymerase iii, the yeast analog of mammalian dna polymerase delta. these studies indicate that dna polymerase iii is an essential component of the dna replication machinery.
