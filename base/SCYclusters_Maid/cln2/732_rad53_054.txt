mdt, a novel rad fha domain interacting protein, modulates dna damage tolerance and g()/m cell cycle progression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the rad kinase plays a central role in yeast dna damage checkpoints. rad contains two fha phosphothreonine binding domains that are required for rad activation and possibly downstream signaling. here we show that the n terminal rad fha domain interacts with the rna recognition motif, coiled coil, and sq/tq cluster domain containing protein mdt (yblc). the interaction of rad and mdt depends on the structural integrity of the fha phosphothreonine binding site as well as threonine of mdt. mdt is constitutively threonine phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated in response to dna damage in vivo. dna damage dependent mdt hyperphosphorylation depends on the mec and tel checkpoint kinases, and mec can directly phosphorylate a recombinant mdt sq/tq domain fragment. mdt overexpression is synthetically lethal with a rad deletion, whereas mdt deletion partially suppresses the dna damage hypersensitivity of checkpoint compromised strains and generally improves dna damage tolerance. in the absence of dna damage, mdt deletion leads to delayed anaphase completion, with an elongated cell morphology reminiscent of that of g()/m cell cycle mutants. mdt dependent and dna damage dependent cell cycle delays are not additive, suggesting that they act in the same pathway. the data indicate that mdt is involved in normal g()/m cell cycle progression and is a novel target of checkpoint dependent cell cycle arrest pathways.
