the nature of the ' terminus is a major determinant for dna processing by schizosaccharomyces pombe radp, a fen family nuclease.. . the nuclease activity of fen is essential for both dna replication and repair. intermediate dna products formed during these processes possess a variety of structures and termini. we have previously demonstrated that the ' &gt;' exonuclease activity of the schizosaccharomyces pombe fen protein radp requires a ' phosphoryl moiety to efficiently degrade a nick containing substrate in a reconstituted alternative excision repair system. here we report the effect of different ' terminal moieties of a variety of dna substrates on radp activity. we also show that radp possesses a ' &gt;' single stranded exonuclease activity, similar to saccharomyces cerevisiae radp and phage t ' &gt;' exonuclease (also a fen homolog). fen nucleases have been associated with the base excision repair pathway, specifically processing cleaved abasic sites. because several enzymes cleave abasic sites through different mechanisms resulting in different ' termini, we investigated the ability of radp to process several different types of cleaved abasic sites. with varying efficiency, radp degrades the products of an abasic site cleaved by escherichia coli endonuclease iii and endonuclease iv (prototype ap endonucleases) and s.pombe. uvep. these results provide important insights into the roles of radp in dna repair processes in s.pombe.
