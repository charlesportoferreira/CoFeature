purification and characterization of a uracil dna glycosylase from the yeast. saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . an activity which releases free uracil from bacteriophage pbs dna has been purified over , fold from extracts of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the enzyme is active on both native and denatured pbs dna and is active in the absence of divalent cation, and in the presence of mm edta. the enzyme has a negative molecular weight of , as estimated by glycerol gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. enzyme activity has been recovered after denaturation in sds and electrophoresis in an sds polyacrylamide gel. this analysis suggests that the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of about , daltons. normal levels of uracil dna glycosylase activity were found in partially purified extracts of the nitrous acid sensitive rad mutant of yeast.
