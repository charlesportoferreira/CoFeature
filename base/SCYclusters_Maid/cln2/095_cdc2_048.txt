functional synergy between dp and ef in the cell cycle regulating transcription factor drtf/ef.. . it is widely believed that the cellular transcription factor drtf/ef integrates cell cycle events with the transcription apparatus because during cell cycle progression in mammalian cells it interacts with molecules that are important regulators of cellular proliferation, such as the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor gene product (prb), p, cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases. thus, prb, which negatively regulates early cell cycle progression and is frequently mutated in tumour cells, and the rb related protein p, bind to and repress the transcriptional activity of drtf/ef. viral oncoproteins, such as adenovirus ea and sv large t antigen, overcome such repression by sequestering prb and p and in so doing are likely to activate genes regulated by drtf/ef, such as cdc, c myc and dhfr. two sequence specific dna binding proteins, ef and dp , which bind to the ef site, contain a small region of similarity. the functional relationship between them has, however, been unclear. we report here that dp and ef exist in a dna binding complex in vivo and that they bind efficiently and preferentially as a heterodimer to the ef site. moreover, studies in yeast and drosophila cells indicate that dp and ef interact synergistically in ef site dependent transcriptional activation.
