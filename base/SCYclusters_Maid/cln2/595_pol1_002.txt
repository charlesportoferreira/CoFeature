net stimulates rna polymerase i transcription and regulates nucleolar structure independently of controlling mitotic exit.. . the budding yeast rent complex, consisting of at least three proteins (net, cdc, sir), is anchored to the nucleolus by net. rent controls mitotic exit, nucleolar silencing, and nucleolar localization of nop. here, we report two new functions of net. first, net directly binds pol i and stimulates rrna synthesis both in vitro and in vivo. second, net modulates nucleolar structure by regulating rdna morphology and proper localization of multiple nucleolar antigens, including pol i. importantly, we show that the nucleolar and previously described cell cycle functions of the rent complex can be uncoupled by a dominant mutant allele of cdc. the independent functions of net link a key event in the cell cycle to nucleolar processes that are fundamental to cell growth.
