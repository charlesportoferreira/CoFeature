association of rad with double strand breaks through a mec dependent mechanism.. . rad is required for the activation of dna damage checkpoint pathways in budding yeast. rad is phosphorylated after dna damage in a mec and tel dependent manner and subsequently interacts with rad. this rad rad interaction has been suggested to trigger the activation and phosphorylation of rad. here we show that mec controls the rad accumulation at double strand breaks (dsbs). rad was phosphorylated after dsb induction and associated with dsbs. however, its phosphorylation and association with dsbs were significantly decreased in cells carrying a mecdelta or kinase negative mec mutation. mec phosphorylated the s/tq motifs of rad in vitro, the same motifs that are phosphorylated after dna damage in vivo. in addition, multiple mutations in the rad s/tq motifs resulted in its defective association with dsbs. phosphorylation of rad was partially defective in cells carrying a weak mec allele (mec ), whereas its association with dsbs occurred efficiently in the mec mutants, as found in wild type cells. however, the rad rad interaction after dsb induction was significantly decreased in mec mutants, as it was in mecdelta mutants. deletion mutation in rad did not affect the association of rad with dsbs. our results suggest that mec promotes association of rad with sites of dna damage, thereby leading to full phosphorylation of rad and its interaction with rad.
