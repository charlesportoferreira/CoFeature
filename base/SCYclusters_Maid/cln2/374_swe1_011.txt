candida albicans int induced filamentation in saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on slap.. . the candida albicans int gene is important for hyphal morphogenesis, adherence, and virulence (c. gale, c. bendel, m. mcclellan, m. hauser, j. m. becker, j. berman, and m. hostetter, science . , ). the ability to switch between yeast and hyphal morphologies is an important virulence factor in this fungal pathogen. when int is expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae, cells grow with a filamentous morphology that we exploited to gain insights into how c. albicans regulates hyphal growth. in s. cerevisiae, int induced filamentous growth was affected by a small subset of actin mutations and a limited set of actin interacting proteins including slap, an s. cerevisiae protein with similarity in its c terminus to mouse talin. interestingly, while sla was required for int induced filamentous growth, it was not required for polarized growth in response to several other conditions, suggesting that slap is not required for polarized growth per se. the morphogenesis checkpoint, mediated by swep, contributes to int induced filamentous growth; however, epistasis analysis suggests that slap and swep contribute to int induced filamentous growth through independent pathways. the c. albicans sla homolog (casla) complements s. cerevisiae sladelta mutants for growth at degrees c and int induced filamentous growth. furthermore, in a c. albicans casla/casla strain, hyphal growth did not occur in response to either nutrient deprivation or to potent stimuli, such as mammalian serum. thus, through analysis of int induced filamentous growth in s. cerevisiae, we have identified a c. albicans gene, sla, that is required for hyphal growth in c. albicans.
