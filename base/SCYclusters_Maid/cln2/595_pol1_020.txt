positive cis acting regulatory sequences mediate proper control of pol transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the 'acgcgt' mlui motif, which is found in the upstream region of several yeast dna synthesis genes which are periodically expressed during the mitotic cell cycle, is present twice in the ' non coding region of the dna polymerase alpha gene (pol). deletion of the most distal repeat does not affect pol transcription, while the adjacent base pair (bp) downstream sequence is necessary both for the proper level and the fluctuation of pol mrna. this region contains the 'acgcgtcgcgt' sequence, which is sufficient to control periodic transcription of a cyc lacz reporter gene with the same kinetics observed for pol. the adjacent bp at rich region does not show any activity by itself, but it acts synergistically in conjunction with at least one mlui hexamer to stimulate cyc lacz expression. by further deletion analysis, dna sequences necessary to initiate pol transcription at the proper sites have also been identified.
