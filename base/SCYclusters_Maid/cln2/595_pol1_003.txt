the saccharomyces cerevisiae mum gene interacts with the dna replication machinery and is required for meiotic levels of double strand breaks.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae mum gene is essential for meiotic, but not mitotic, dna replication and thus sporulation. genetic interactions between mum and a component of the origin recognition complex and polymerase alpha primase suggest that mum influences the function of the dna replication machinery. early meiotic gene expression is induced to a much greater extent in mum cells than in meiotic cells treated with the dna synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea. this result indicates that the mum meiotic arrest is downstream of the arrest induced by hydroxyurea and suggests that dna synthesis is initiated in the mutant. genetic analyses indicate that the recombination that occurs in mum mutants is dependent on the normal recombination machinery and on synaptonemal complex components and therefore is not a consequence of lesions created by incompletely replicated dna. both meiotic ectopic and allelic recombination are similarly reduced in the mum mutant, and the levels are consistent with the levels of meiosis specific dsbs that are generated. cytological analyses of mum mutants show that chromosome pairing and synapsis occur, although at reduced levels compared to wild type. given the near wild type levels of meiotic gene expression, pairing, and synapsis, we suggest that the reduction in dna replication is directly responsible for the reduced level of dsbs and meiotic recombination.
