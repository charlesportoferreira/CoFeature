regulation of saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc function during the cell cycle.. . the yeast cdc function is required for the g/s transition and is dependent on passage through start, a point controlled by the cdc/cdc/p protein kinase. cdc encodes a protein kinase activity, and we now show that this kinase activity varies in the cell cycle but that protein levels appear to remain constant. we present several lines of evidence that periodic activation of cdc kinase is at least in part through phosphorylation. first, the kinase activity of the cdc protein is destroyed by dephosphorylation of the protein in vitro with phosphatase. second, cdc protein is hypophosphorylated and inactive as a kinase in extracts of cells arrested at start but becomes active and maximally phosphorylated subsequent to passage through start. the phosphorylation pattern of cdc protein is complex. phosphopeptide mapping reveals four phosphopeptides in cdc prepared from asynchronous yeast cells. both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation in trans appear to contribute to this pattern. autophosphorylation is shown to occur by using a thermolabile cdc protein. a protein in yeast extracts can phosphorylate and activate cdc protein made in escherichia coli, and phosphorylation is thermolabile in cdc mutant extracts. cdc protein carrying a serine to alanine change in the consensus recognition site for cdc kinase shows an altered phosphopeptide map, suggesting that this site is important in determining the overall cdc phosphorylation pattern.
