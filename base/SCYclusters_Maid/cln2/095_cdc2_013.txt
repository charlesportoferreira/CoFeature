checkpoint dependent activation of mutagenic repair in saccharomyces cerevisiae pol mutants.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna polymerase delta proofreading exonuclease defective mutation pol is known to cause high rates of accumulating mutations. the pol mutant was found to have abnormal cell cycle progression due to activation of the s phase checkpoint. inactivation of the s phase checkpoint suppressed both the pol cell cycle progression defect and mutator phenotype, indicating that the pol mutator phenotype was dependent on the s phase damage checkpoint pathway. epistasis analysis suggested that a portion of the pol mutator phenotype involves members of the rad epistasis group that function in both error free and error prone repair. these results indicate that activation of a checkpoint in response to certain types of replicative defects can result in the accumulation of mutations.
