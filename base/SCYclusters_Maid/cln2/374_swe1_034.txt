conservation of mitotic controls in fission and budding yeasts.. . in fission yeast, the initiation of mitosis is regulated by a control network that integrates the opposing activities of mitotic inducers and inhibitors. to evaluate whether this control system is likely to be conserved among eukaryotes, we have investigated whether a similar mitotic control operates in the distantly related budding yeast s. cerevisiae. we have found that the protein kinase encoded by the mitotic inhibitor gene wee+ of fission yeast, which acts to delay mitosis, is able also to delay the initiation of mitosis when expressed in s. cerevisiae. the wee+ activity is counteracted in s. cerevisiae by the gene product of mih, a newly identified gene capable of encoding a protein of mw ,, which is a structural and functional homolog of the cdc+ mitotic inducer of fission yeast. expression of wee+ in a mih strain prevents the initiation of mitosis. these data indicate that important features of the cdc+ wee+ mitotic control network identified in s. pombe are conserved in s. cerevisiae, and therefore are also likely to be generally conserved among eukaryotic organisms.
