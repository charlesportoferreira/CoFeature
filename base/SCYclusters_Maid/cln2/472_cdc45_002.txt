mechanisms of dna topoisomerase i induced cell killing in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dna topoisomerase i (top) catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled dna by a mechanism of transient dna strand cleavage characterized by the formation of a phosphotyrosyl bond between the dna end and active site tyrosine. camptothecin reversibly stabilizes the covalent enzyme dna intermediate by inhibiting dna religation. during s phase, collisions with advancing replication forks convert these complexes into potentially lethal lesions. to define the dna damage induced by alterations in topp catalysis and the cellular processes that mediate the repair of such lesions, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae was used. substitution of conserved residues n terminal to the active site tyrosine (tyr ) produced alterations in the camptothecin sensitivity or catalytic cycle of dna top. for example, substituting ala for thr in topta increased the stability of the covalent enzyme dna intermediate. as with camptothecin, topta induced cytotoxicity was ascribed to a reduction in dna religation. by contrast, enhanced covalent complex formation by topnh resulted from a relative increase in the rate of dna cleavage. conditional yeast mutants were also selected that exhibit temperature sensitive growth only in the presence of the self poisoning topta enzyme. subsequent analyses of these tah mutants identified genes whose function suppresses the cytotoxic action of camptothecin and topta. these include genes encoding essential dna replication proteins (cdc and dpb) and proteins involved in sumo or ubiquitination (ubc and doa).
