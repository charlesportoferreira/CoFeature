genetic mapping of the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna polymerase i gene and characterization of a pol temperature sensitive mutant altered in dna primase polymerase complex stability.. . the cloned dna polymerase i gene has been used to map the pol locus on the left arm of chromosome xiv, between met and top. temperature sensitive mutants in pol have been obtained by in vitro mutagenesis of the cloned gene and in vivo replacement of the wild type allele with the mutated copy. physiological and biochemical characterization of one temperature sensitive mutant (pol ) shows that cells shifted to the non permissive temperature can complete one round of cell division and dna replication before they arrest. analysis of dna polymerase i in crude extracts and in partially purified preparations indicates that the pol mutation results in a conformational change and affects the stability of the dna primase polymerase complex.
