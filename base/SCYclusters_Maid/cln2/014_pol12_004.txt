cell cycle dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the yeast dna polymerase alpha primase b subunit.. . the yeast dna polymerase alpha primase b subunit functions in initiation of dna replication. this protein is present in two forms, of and kda, and the p polypeptide results from cell cycle regulated phosphorylation of p. the b subunit present in g arises by dephosphorylation of p while cells are exiting from mitosis, becomes phosphorylated in early s phase, and is competent and sufficient to initiate dna replication. the b subunit transiently synthesized as a consequence of periodic transcription of the pol gene is phosphorylated no earlier than g. phosphorylation of the b subunit does not require execution of the cdc dependent step and ongoing dna synthesis. we suggest that posttranslational modifications of the b subunit might modulate the role of dna polymerase alpha primase in dna replication.
