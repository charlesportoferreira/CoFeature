saccharomyces cerevisiae msh, a mispaired base recognition protein, also recognizes holliday junctions in dna.. . genetic and biochemical studies have suggested that mismatch repair proteins interact with recombination intermediates to prevent recombination, or to limit the extent of formation of heteroduplex dna during recombination between divergent dna sequences. to test the idea that mismatch repair proteins regulate recombination by interacting with recombination intermediates, we investigated whether the saccharomyces cerevisiae muts homolog msh could interact with holliday junctions. both filter binding and electron microscopic analysis showed that msh bound to duplex dna molecules containing holliday junctions with a higher affinity than to control duplex dna, single stranded dna or a control duplex dna containing a mispaired base. the msh holliday junction complexes were also more stable than msh duplex dna complexes. this observation suggests that msh protein could directly coordinate the interaction between mismatch repair and genetic recombination observed in genetic studies.
