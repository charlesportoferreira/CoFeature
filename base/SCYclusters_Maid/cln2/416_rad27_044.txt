processing of branched dna intermediates by a complex of human fen and pcna.. . in eukaryotic cells, a ' flap dna endonuclease activity and a ds dna ' exonuclease activity exist within a single enzyme called fen [flap endo nuclease and (five)' exo nuclease]. this kda endo /exonuclease, fen , is highly homologous to human xp g, saccharomyces cerevisiae rad and s.cerevisiae rth. these structure specific nucleases recognize and cleave a branched dna structure called a dna flap, and its derivative called a pseudo y structure. fen is essential for lagging strand dna synthesis in okazaki fragment joining. fen also appears to be important in mismatch repair. here we find that human pcna, the processivity factor for eukaryotic polymerases, physically associates with human fen and stimulates its endonucleolytic activity at branched dna structures and its exonucleolytic activity at nick and gap structures. structural requirements for fen and pcna loading provide an interesting picture of this stimulation. pcna loads on to substrates at double stranded dna ends. in contrast, fen requires a free single stranded ' terminus and appears to load by tracking along the single stranded dna branch. these physical constraints define the range of dna replication, recombination and repair processes in which this family of structure specific nucleases participate. a model explaining the exonucleolytic activity of fen in terms of its endonucleolytic activity is proposed based on these observations.
