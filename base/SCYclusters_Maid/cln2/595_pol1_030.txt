identification and isolation of the gene encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna damage inducible gene required for mitotic viability.. . ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the first step in the pathway for the production of deoxyribonucleotides needed for dna synthesis. the gene encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase was isolated from a saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic dna expression library in lambda gt by a fortuitous cross reaction with anti reca antibodies. the cross reaction was due to an identity between the last four amino acids of each protein. the gene has been named rnr and is centromere linked on chromosome x. the nucleotide sequence was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence, amino acids, shows extensive homology with other eucaryotic ribonucleotide reductases. transplason mutagenesis was used to disrupt the rnr gene. a novel assay using colony color sectoring was developed to demonstrate visually that rnr is essential for mitotic viability. rnr encodes a . kilobase mrna whose levels increase fold after treatment with the dna damaging agent nitroquinoline oxide. cdc was also found to be inducible by dna damage, but pol and ura were not inducible by nitroquinoline oxide. the expression of these genes defines a new mode of regulation for enzymes involved in dna biosynthesis and sharpens our picture of the events leading to dna repair in eucaryotic cells.
