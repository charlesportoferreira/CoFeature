the yeast recombinational repair protein rad interacts with rad and stimulates single strand annealing.. . the yeast rad gene is essential for homology dependent repair of dna double strand breaks. in vitro, rad binds to single and double stranded dna and promotes annealing of complementary single stranded dna. genetic studies indicate that the rad and rad proteins act in the same recombination pathway either as a complex or through overlapping functions. here we demonstrate physical interaction between rad and rad using the yeast two hybrid system and co immunoprecipitation from yeast extracts. purified rad efficiently anneals complementary oligonucleotides and is able to overcome the inhibition to annealing imposed by replication protein a (rpa). although rad has strand annealing activity by itself in vitro, this activity is insufficient to promote strand annealing in vivo in the absence of rad. the rfa dy allele partially suppresses the in vivo strand annealing defect of rad mutants, but this is independent of rad. these results suggest that in vivo rad is unable to compete with rpa for single stranded dna and therefore is unable to promote single strand annealing. instead, rad appears to augment the activity of rad in strand annealing.
