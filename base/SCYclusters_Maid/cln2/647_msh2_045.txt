isolation and characterization of two saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encoding homologs of the bacterial hexa and muts mismatch repair proteins.. . homologs of the escherichia coli (mutl, s and uvrd) and streptococcus pneumoniae (hexa, b) genes involved in mismatch repair are known in several distantly related organisms. degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on conserved regions of e. coli muts protein and its homologs from salmonella typhimurium, s. pneumoniae and human were used in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to amplify and clone muts/hexa homologs from saccharomyces cerevisiae. two dna sequences were amplified whose deduced amino acid sequences both shared a high degree of homology with muts. these sequences were then used to clone the full length genes from a yeast genomic library. sequence analysis of the two msh genes (msh = muts homolog), msh and msh, revealed open reading frames of bp and bp. the deduced amino acid sequences predict polypeptides of . kd and . kd, respectively. the overall amino acid sequence identity with the e. coli muts protein is .% for msh and .% for msh. features previously found to be shared by muts homologs, such as the nucleotide binding site and the helix turn helix dna binding motif as well as other highly conserved regions whose function remain unknown, were also found in the two yeast homologs. evidence presented in this and a companion study suggest that msh is involved in repair of mitochondrial dna and that msh is involved in nuclear dna repair.
