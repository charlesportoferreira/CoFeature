checkpoint arrest signaling in response to uv damage is independent of nucleotide excision repair in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the recognition of dna double stranded breaks or single stranded dna gaps as a precondition for cell cycle checkpoint arrest has been well established. however, how bulky base damage such as uv induced pyrimidine dimers elicits a checkpoint response has remained elusive. nucleotide excision repair represents the main pathway for uv dimer removal that results in strand interruptions. however, we demonstrate here that radp hyperphosphorylation, an early event of checkpoint signaling in saccharomyces cerevisiae, is independent of nucleotide excision repair (ner), even if replication as a source of secondary dna damage is excluded. thus, our data hint at primary base damage or at uv damage (primary or secondary) that does not need to be processed by ner as the relevant substrate of damage sensing checkpoint proteins.
