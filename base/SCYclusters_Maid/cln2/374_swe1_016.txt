filamentous growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by manganese.. . the candida albicans int gene is a virulence factor that contributes to both adhesion and filamentous growth of the fungus. expression of int in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae directs both adhesion and filamentous growth. because intp contains two predicted divalent cation binding motifs, we asked whether divalent cations are important for the role of intp in filament formation. in this study, we found that int induced filamentous growth (i ifg) is sensitive to the divalent cation chelator edta and that this edta sensitivity can be ameliorated by the addition of mn(+), but not mg(+) or ca(+) ions. the addition of mncl() restored both the proportion of cells forming filaments and the length of filaments formed. expression of int in s. cerevisiae mutants that reduce the intracellular concentration of mn(+) did not affect i ifg. interestingly, the mn(+) dependence of i ifg is not dependent upon the presence of the putative divalent cation binding domains found in int. rather, we found that polarized growth induced by mutations in cdc and cla or by expression of excess swe was also sensitive to edta treatment and was restored by the addition of mncl() but not by the addition of cacl(). thus, our results suggest that in s. cerevisiae polarized growth is dependent upon the presence of mn(+) ions. copyright academic press.
