the fifth essential dna polymerase phi in saccharomyces cerevisiae is localized to the nucleolus and plays an important role in synthesis of rrna.. . we report that pol encodes the fifth essential dna polymerase in saccharomyces cerevisiae. polp was identified and purified from yeast cell extracts and is an aphidicolin sensitive dna polymerase that is stimulated by yeast proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna). thus, we named polp dna polymerase phi. temperature sensitive pol mutants did not arrest at g()/m at the restrictive temperature. furthermore, the polymerase active site mutant poldn gene complements the lethality of delta pol. these results suggest that the polymerase activity of polp is not required for the in vivo function of polp. rrna synthesis was severely inhibited at the restrictive temperature in the temperature sensitive pol mutant cells, suggesting that an essential function of polp is rrna synthesis. polp is localized exclusively to the nucleolus and binds near or at the enhancer region of rrna encoding dna repeating units.
