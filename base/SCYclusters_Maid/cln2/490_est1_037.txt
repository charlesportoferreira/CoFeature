est has the properties of a single stranded telomere end binding protein.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of the est gene results in phenotypes identical to those displayed by a deletion of a known component of telomerase (the yeast telomerase rna), arguing that est is also critical for telomerase function. in this study, we show that the estl protein binds to yeast g rich telomeric oligonucleotides in vitro. binding is specific for single stranded substrates and requires a free ' terminus, consistent with the properties expected for a protein bound to the ' single stranded g rich extension present at the telomere. assessment of the in vivo function of this single stranded dna binding protein has shown that est acts in the same pathway of telomere replication as the tlc telomerase rna, by several different genetic criteria. est tlc double mutant strains show no enhancement of phenotype relative to either single mutant strain, and est dominant mutations have an effect on telomeric silencing similar to that displayed by tlc previously. we propose that est is a telomere end binding protein that is required to mediate recognition of the end of the chromosome by telomerase.
