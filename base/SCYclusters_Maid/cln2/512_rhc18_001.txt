smc is required for mms induced interchromosomal and sister chromatid recombinations in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . smc (rhc) in saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a homologue of the schizosaccharomyces pombe rad+ gene and essential for cell viability, encodes a structural maintenance of chromosomes (smc) family protein. in contrast to the rest of the smc family of proteins, smc smc, which are the components of cohesin or condensin, little is known about smc. in this study, we generated temperature sensitive (ts) smc mutants of budding yeast and characterized their properties. one ts mutant, smc , ceased growth soon after up shift to a non permissive temperature, arrested in the late s and g/m phase, and gradually lost viability. smc cells at a permissive temperature showed a higher sensitivity than wild type cells to various dna damaging agents including methyl methanesulfonate (mms). the rad smc double mutant showed a sensitivity to mms similar to that of the rad single mutant, indicating that smc is involved in a pathway that requires rad to function. moreover, no induction of interchromosomal recombination and sister chromatid recombination was observed in smc cells, which occurred in wild type cells upon exposure to mms.
