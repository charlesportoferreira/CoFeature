overexpression of the protein kinase pak suppresses yeast dna polymerase mutations.. . this article presents the identification and characterization of the pak gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the biochemical characterization of the protein kinase activity that it encodes. overexpression of the pak gene product suppresses temperature sensitive mutations of the poll (cdc ) gene, which encodes dna polymerase alpha. overexpression and suppression can be achieved either by expressing pak from a high copy number plasmid, or by gal induced transcription of pak. gene disruption of pak indicates that it is not an essential gene. the pak gene encodes a protein with a kinase consensus domain. by deletion analysis and site directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the complete and active kinase consensus domain is required for suppression. a glutathione s transferase (gst) pak fusion protein, overproduced in bacteria, can be purified in an active form with glutathione affinity beads or by immunoprecipitation. thus, other protein subunits of pak are not required for its activity. in vitro protein kinase assays show that gst pak can autophosphorylate, and can phosphorylate casein as an exogenous substrate. the phenotype of the suppressed cdc cells indicates that pak suppression is inefficient and does not restore the wild type phenotype. pak suppression requires rad function, but pak does not affect rad function. overexpression of pak does not enhance the expression of the pol gene. pak may function by modifying and partially stabilizing thermolabile dna polymerases, perhaps during dna repair, because pak mutant cells are caffeine sensitive.
