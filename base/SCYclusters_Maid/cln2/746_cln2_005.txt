the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue ypa of the mammalian phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator of protein phosphatase a controls progression through the g phase of the yeast cell cycle.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ypa encodes a protein homologous to the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator, ptpa, of the mammalian protein phosphatase type a (ppa). in order to examine the biological role of ptpa, we disrupted ypa and characterised the phenotype of the ypadelta mutant. comparison of the growth rate of the wild type strain and the ypadelta mutant on glucose rich medium after nutrient depletion showed that the ypadelta mutant traversed the lag period more rapidly. this accelerated progression through &quot;start&quot; was also observed after release from alpha factor induced g arrest as evidenced by a higher number of budding cells, a faster increase in cln mrna expression and a more rapid reactivation of cdc kinase activity. this phenotype was specific for deletion of ypa since it was not observed when ypa, the second ptpa gene in budding yeast was deleted. reintroduction of ypa or the human ptpa cdna in the ypadelta mutant suppressed this phenotype as opposed to overexpression of ypa. disruption of both ypa genes is lethal, since sporulation of heterozygous diploids resulted in at most three viable spores, none of them with a ypadelta ypadelta genotype. this observation indicates that ypa and ypa share some essential functions. we compared the ypadelta mutant phenotype with a ppa double deletion mutant and a ppa temperature sensitive mutant. the ppa deficient yeast strain also showed accelerated progression through the g phase. in addition, both ppa and ypadelta mutants show similar aberrant bud morphology. this would support the notion that ypa may act as a positive regulator of ppa in vivo. copyright academic press.
