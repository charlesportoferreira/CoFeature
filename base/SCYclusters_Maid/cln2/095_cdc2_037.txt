the cys his motif of ty nc can be contributed by gag or gag pol polyproteins.. . the major structural proteins capsid and nucleocapsid (nc) of the saccharomyces cerevisiae retroviruslike element ty are produced as domains within the gag and gag pol precursor polyproteins. ty nc contains one copy of the conserved motif cxcxhxc found in most retroviral nc proteins. we show here that nc proteins derived by processing of these different precursor species differ at their carboxyl termini. to determine whether the cys his motifs of these nascent nc domains contribute differently to replication, gag and gag pol fusion proteins containing wild type or mutant cys his domains were expressed from separate constructs. although the cys his box was shown to be essential for polyprotein processing of a wild type ty element, this domain could be contributed from gag or as part of gag pol. these data suggest that the functions of the retroviral nc cys his domain contributed from gag and gag pol are redundant.
