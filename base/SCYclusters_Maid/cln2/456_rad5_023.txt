analysis of mutagenic dna repair in a thermoconditional repair mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae. ii. influence of cycloheximide on uv irradiated exponentially growing revts cells.. . the time course of rev dependent recovery from prelethal uv damage and uv induced locus specific reversion of the his allele was determined in temperature shift experiments by use of a thermoconditional allele of the rev gene (rad , revts). in uv irradiated, exponentially growing revts cells the rev dependent repair activity persists for up to h at permissive temperature ( degrees c), while the rev dependent mutagenic process is mostly completed within h. the rev dependent process in exponentially growing cells is highly impaired by inhibition of protein synthesis. however, a rev dependent repair activity independent of de novo synthesis is detectable, even in the presence of up to micrograms/ml cycloheximide, a response not found in stationary phase cells. thus, the rev dependent process seems to be partially constitutive in exponentially growing cells. additionally, exponentially growing revts cells were considerably more uv sensitive at restrictive temperature ( degrees c) than were stationary phase cells.
