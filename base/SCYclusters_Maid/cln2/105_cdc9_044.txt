the yeast dna polymerase i transcript is regulated in both the mitotic cell cycle and in meiosis and is also induced after dna damage.. . using mitotic cultures synchronised by a feed starve protocol or by elutriation, we have shown that the yeast dna polymerase i gene is periodically expressed with its transcript increasing at least fold in late g with a peak around the g/s phase boundary. this is precisely the same interval of the cell cycle in which three other yeast dna synthesis genes, cdc, cdc and cdc, have been found to be periodically expressed (white et al . expl. cell. res., in press). the polymerase i transcript is also regulated in meiosis, showing an overall fluctuation in level of some fold, with a peak at about mid s phase. in addition, following irradiation with j/m ultraviolet light, there was a fold increase in the transcript, starting after minutes and reaching a peak two hours later. these results indicate that dna polymerase i is subject to a complex control and imply that it has a role in both dna synthesis and dna repair.
