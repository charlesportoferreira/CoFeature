the human bloom syndrome gene suppresses the dna replication and repair defects of yeast dna mutants.. . bloom syndrome is a disorder of profound and early cancer predisposition in which cells become hypermutable, exhibit high frequency of sister chromatid exchanges, and show increased micronuclei. blm, the gene mutated in bloom syndrome, has been cloned previously, and the blm protein is a member of the recq family of dna helicases. many lines of evidence suggest that blm is involved either directly in dna replication or in surveillance during dna replication, but its specific roles remain unknown. here we show that hblm can suppress both the temperature sensitive growth defect and the dna damage sensitivity of the yeast dna replication mutant dna . the dna mutant is defective in a helicase nuclease that is required either to coordinate with the crucial saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc) fen nuclease in okazaki fragment maturation or to compensate for scfen when its activity is impaired. we show that human blm interacts with both scdna and scfen by using coimmunoprecipitation from yeast extracts, suggesting that human blm participates in the same steps of dna replication or repair as scfen and scdna.
