scf ubiquitin protein ligases and phosphorylation dependent proteolysis.. . many key activators and inhibitors of cell division are targeted for degradation by a recently described family of e ubiquitin protein ligases termed skp cdc f box protein (scf) complexes. scf complexes physically link substrate proteins to the e ubiquitin conjugating enzyme cdc, which catalyses substrate ubiquitination, leading to subsequent degradation by the s proteasome. scf complexes contain a variable subunit called an f box protein that confers substrate specificity on an invariant core complex composed of the subunits cdc, skp and cdc. here, we review the substrates and pathways regulated by the yeast f box proteins cdc, grr and met. the concepts of scf ubiquitin ligase function are illustrated by analysis of the degradation pathway for the g cyclin cln. through mass spectrometric analysis of cdc associated proteins, we have identified three novel f box proteins that appear to participate in scf like complexes. as many f box proteins can be found in sequence databases, it appears that a host of cellular pathways will be regulated by scf dependent proteolysis.
