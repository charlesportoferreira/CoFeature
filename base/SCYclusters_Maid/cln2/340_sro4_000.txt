ervp directs a transmembrane secretory protein into copii coated transport vesicles.. . ervp is a conserved integral membrane protein that traffics in copii coated vesicles and localizes to the early secretory pathway in yeast. deletion of erv causes a defect in polarized growth because axlp, a transmembrane secretory protein, accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and is not delivered to its site of function on the cell surface. herein, we show that ervp is required for selection of axlp into copii vesicles and for efficient formation of these vesicles. ervp binds to subunits of the copii coat and binding depends on conserved residues in a cytoplasmically exposed loop domain of ervp. when mutations are introduced into this loop, an ervp axlp complex accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that ervp links axlp to the copii coat. based on these results and further genetic experiments, we propose ervp coordinates copii vesicle formation with incorporation of specific secretory cargo.
