the dna replication and damage checkpoint pathways induce transcription by inhibition of the crt repressor.. . we have identified the yeast crt gene as an effector of the dna damage and replication checkpoint pathway. crt encodes a dna binding protein that recruits the general repressors ssn and tup to the promoters of damage inducible genes. derepression of the crt regulon suppresses the lethality of mec and rad null alleles and is essential for cell viability during replicative stress. in response to dna damage and replication blocks, crt becomes hyperphosphorylated and no longer binds dna, resulting in transcriptional induction. crt is autoregulated and is itself induced by dna damage, indicating the existence of a negative feedback pathway that facilitates return to the repressed state after elimination of damage. the inhibition of an autoregulatory repressor in response to dna damage is a strategy conserved throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution.
