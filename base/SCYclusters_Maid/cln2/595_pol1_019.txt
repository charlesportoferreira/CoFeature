control of dna synthesis genes in budding yeast. involvement of the transcriptional modulator mot in the expression of the dna polymerase alpha gene.. . periodic transcription during the cell cycle of the budding yeast dna polymerase alpha gene (pol) requires the cis acting element ' acgcgt ', which has been found in the ' non coding region of all the dna synthesis genes analyzed so far. search for trans acting mutations affecting pol expression led to the isolation of the temperature sensitive reg mutant, that showed increased levels of both dna polymerase alpha and delta gene transcripts. cloning of the reg gene demonstrated that it is essential for cell viability and required for proper expression of the pol gene. dna sequence comparison established that the reg gene is identical to mot, a gene encoding a presumptive dna helicase which modulates transcription of several yeast genes.
