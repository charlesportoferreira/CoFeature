the dac/fus protein kinase is not essential for transcriptional activation of the mating pheromone response pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the dac/fus gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes a cdc/cdc related protein kinase, is essential both for the arrest of cell division induced by mating pheromones and for cell fusion during conjugation. to elucidate the role of the dac gene product in the pheromone response pathway, i determined the nucleotide sequence of the dac gene and characterized two types of deletion mutants of the dac gene. here, i show that the dac gene is identical to the fus gene and that dac/fus deletion mutants respond to mating pheromones by activating transcription. therefore, the dac/fus gene is not essential for transcriptional activation in the pheromone response pathway. the dac/fus protein kinase has a positive role in cell fusion during sexual conjugation.
