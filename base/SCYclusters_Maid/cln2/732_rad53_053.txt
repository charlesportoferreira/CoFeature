hydroxyurea arrests dna replication by a mechanism that preserves basal dntp pools.. . the relationship between dntp levels and dna synthesis was investigated using alpha factor synchronized yeast treated with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (hu). although hu blocked dna synthesis and prevented the dntp pool expansion that normally occurs at g/s, it did not exhaust the levels of any of the four dntps, which dropped to about % of g levels. when dbf yeast that are ts for replication initiation were allowed to preaccumulate dntps at degrees c before being released to degrees c in the presence of hu, they synthesized . genome equivalents of dna and then arrested as dntps approached sub g levels. accumulation of dntps at g/s was not a prerequisite for replication initiation, since dbf cells incubated in hu at degrees c were able to replicate when subsequently switched to degrees c in the absence of hu. the replication arrest mechanism was not dependent on the mec/rad pathway, since checkpoint deficient rad cells also failed to exhaust basal dntps when incubated in hu. the persistence of basal dntp levels in hu arrested cells and partial bypass of the arrest in cells that had preaccumulated dntps suggest that cells have a mechanism for arresting dna chain elongation when dntp levels are not maintained above a critical threshold.
