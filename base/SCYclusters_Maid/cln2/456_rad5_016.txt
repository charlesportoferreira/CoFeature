molecular analysis of the rev gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae a review.. . the rev gene controls dna repair, induced mutagenesis and, probably, some fidelity mechanism of replication. of particular interest is the notion that it is inducible by dna damaging agents. we wanted to find molecular evidence for these results derived from numerous biological experiments. we cloned the rev gene from a yeast genomic dna library based on the ycp centromere vector, sequenced it and studied its regulation on the transcriptional level. the coding region of the rev gene consists of a pb reading frame with a coding capacity for a polypeptide of kd; no significant homology to any gene filed in available data bases was found. examination of a hydrophobicity plot of the putative rev protein predicts the existence of transmembrane helices. quantitative northern analysis confirmed the working hypothesis that dna damaging agents increase the level of rev gene expression in stationary cells. thus, the rev gene seems to code for a membrane protein which is inducible by dna damaging agents and which controls processes of repair and mutagenesis in yeast.
