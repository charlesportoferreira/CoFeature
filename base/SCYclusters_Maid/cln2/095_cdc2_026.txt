isolation and molecular characterisation of the pol gene from candida albicans.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cdc gene encodes the large subunit of dna polymerase iii, the analogue of mammalian dna polymerase delta. we have isolated dna fragments from a library of candida albicans genomic dna in the vector prs that rescue temperature sensitive cdc mutations in s. cerevisiae. these fragments contain an orf coding for a protein of aa with a predicted molecular mass of . kda. the predicted protein shows homology to a number of eukaryotic dna polymerases, with % identity over its length to the s. cerevisiae cdc protein. it also contains a number of motifs which are characteristic of dna polymerases in general and viral polymerases in particular, as well as the conserved motif which interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen. these results indicate that this gene is c. albicans pol. analysis of the expression of c. albicans pol revealed that the transcript is present throughout the mitotic cell cycle, which contrasts with the expression of s. cerevisiae cdc.
