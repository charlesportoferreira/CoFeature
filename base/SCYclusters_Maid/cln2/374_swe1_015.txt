loss of a protein phosphatase a regulatory subunit (cdcp) elicits improper regulation of swep degradation.. . cdc encodes a saccharomyces cerevisiae protein phosphatase a (ppa) regulatory subunit. cdc null cells growing at low temperature exhibit a failure of cytokinesis and produce abnormally elongated buds, but cdc null cells producing the cyclin dependent kinase cdc yf, which is unable to be inhibited by y phosphorylation, show a loss of the abnormal morphology. furthermore, cdc null cells exhibit a hyperphosphorylation of y. for these reasons, we have examined in wild type and cdc null cells the levels and activities of the kinase (swep) and phosphatase (mihp) that normally regulate the extent of cdc y phosphorylation. we find that mihp levels are comparable in the two strains, and an estimate of the in vivo and in vitro phosphatase activity of this enzyme in the two cell types indicates no marked differences. by contrast, while swep levels are similar in unsynchronized and s phase arrested wild type and cdc null cells, swe kinase is found at elevated levels in mitosis arrested cdc null cells. this excess swep in cdc null cells is the result of ectopic stabilization of this protein during g() and m, thereby accounting for the accumulation of swep in mitosis arrested cells. we also present evidence indicating that, in cdc null cells, misregulated ppa phosphatase activity is the cause of both the ectopic stabilization of swep and the production of the morphologically abnormal phenotype.
