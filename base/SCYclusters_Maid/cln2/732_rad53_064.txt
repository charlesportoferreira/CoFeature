dna polymerase stabilization at stalled replication forks requires mec and the recq helicase sgs.. . to ensure proper replication and segregation of the genome, eukaryotic cells have evolved surveillance systems that monitor and react to impaired replication fork progression. in budding yeast, the intra s phase checkpoint responds to stalled replication forks by downregulating late firing origins, preventing spindle elongation and allowing efficient resumption of dna synthesis after recovery from stress. mutations in this pathway lead to high levels of genomic instability, particularly in the presence of dna damage. here we demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation that when yeast replication forks stall due to hydroxyurea (hu) treatment, dna polymerases alpha and epsilon are stabilized for min. this requires the activities of sgs, a member of the recq family of dna helicases, and the atm related kinase mec, but not rad activation. a model is proposed whereby sgs helicase resolves aberrantly paired structures at stalled forks to maintain single stranded dna that allows rp a and mec to promote dna polymerase association.
