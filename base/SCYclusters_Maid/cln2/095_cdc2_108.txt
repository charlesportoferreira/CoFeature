dna polymerase ii (epsilon) of saccharomyces cerevisiae dissociates from the dna template by sensing single stranded dna.. . two forms of dna polymerase ii (epsilon) of saccharomyces cerevisiae, pol ii* and pol ii, were purified to near homogeneity from yeast cells. pol ii* is a four subunit complex containing a kda catalytic polypeptide, whereas pol ii consists solely of a kda polypeptide derived from the n terminal half of the kda polypeptide of pol ii*. we show that pol ii* and pol ii are indistinguishable with respect to the processivity and rate of dna chain elongation. the equilibrium dissociation constants of the complexes of pol ii* and pol ii with the dna template showed that the stability of these complexes is almost the same. however, when the rates of dissociation of the pol ii* and pol ii from the dna template were measured using single stranded dna as a trap for the dissociated polymerase, pol ii* dissociated fold faster than pol ii. furthermore, the rate of dissociation of pol ii* from the dna template became faster as the concentration of the single stranded dna was increased. these results indicate that the rapid dissociation of pol ii* from the dna template is actively promoted by single stranded dna. the dissociation of pol ii from the dna template was also shown to be promoted by single stranded dna, although at a much slower rate. these results suggest that the site for sensing single stranded dna resides within the kda n terminal portion of the catalytic subunit and that the efficiency for sensing single stranded dna by this site is positively modulated by either the c terminal half of the catalytic subunit and/or the other subunits.
