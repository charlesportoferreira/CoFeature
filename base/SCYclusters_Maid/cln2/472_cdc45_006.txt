the human homolog of saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc.. . in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc is an essential gene required for initiation of dna replication. a structurally related protein tsd is necessary for dna replication in ustilago maydis. we have identified and cloned the gene for a human protein homologous to the fungal proteins. the human gene cdcl is kilobases long and contains introns. the exons encode a protein of amino acids. the human protein is and .% similar to cdcp and tsdp, respectively. the level of cdcl mrna peaks at g s transition, but total protein amount remains constant throughout the cell cycle. consistent with a role of cdcl protein in the initiation of dna replication it co immunoprecipitates from cell extracts with a putative replication initiator protein, human orcl. in addition, subcellular fractionation indicates that the association of the protein with the nuclear fraction becomes labile as s phase progresses. the cdcl gene is located to chromosome q. region by cytogenetics and by fluorescence in situ hybridization. this region, known as digeorge syndrome critical region, is a minimal area of megabases, which is consistently deleted in digeorge syndrome and related disorders. the syndrome is marked by parathyroid hypoplasia, thymic aplasia, or hypoplasia and congenital cardiac abnormalities. cdcl is the first gene mapped to the digeorge syndrome critical region interval whose loss may negatively affect cell proliferation.
