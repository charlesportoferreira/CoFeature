sensitivity of a s. cerevisiae rad deletion mutant to dna damaging agents and in vivo complementation by the human fen gene.. . we have investigated the sensitivity to dna damaging agents of a strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a deletion of the rad gene. the mutant strain is sensitive to a number of alkylating agents that modify dna at a variety of positions, including one that produces primarily phosphotriesters. in contrast, the mutant strain is not sensitive to the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. the introduction of a plasmid containing the fen gene (the human ortholog of the rad gene) can substantially complement the sensitivity to alkylating agents observed in the mutant strain.
