expression of an ortholog of replication protein a (rpa) is induced by gibberellin in deepwater rice.. . internodes of deepwater rice are induced to grow rapidly when plants become submerged. this adaptation enables deepwater rice to keep part of its foliage above the rising flood waters during the monsoon season and to avoid drowning. this growth response is, ultimately, elicited by the plant hormone gibberellin (ga). the primary target tissue for ga action is the intercalary meristem of the internode. using differential display of mrna, we have isolated a number of genes whose expression in the intercalary meristem is regulated by ga. the product of one of these genes was identified as an ortholog of replication protein a (rpa). rpa is a heterotrimeric protein involved in dna replication, recombination, and repair and also in regulation of transcription. a chimeric construct, in which the single stranded dna binding domain of rice rpa was spliced into the corresponding region of yeast rpa, was able to complement a yeast rpa mutant. the transcript level of rice rpa is high in tissues containing dividing cells. rpa mrna levels increase rapidly in the intercalary meristem during submergence and treatment with ga before the increase in the level of histone h mrna, a marker for dna replication.
