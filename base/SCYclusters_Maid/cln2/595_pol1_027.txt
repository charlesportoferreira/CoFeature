dna polymerase i gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. nucleotide sequence, mapping of a temperature sensitive mutation, and protein homology with other dna polymerases.. . a base pair segment spanning the coding region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna polymerase i gene was sequenced and found to contain an open reading frame of codons, corresponding to a polypeptide of mr ,. a pol temperature sensitive mutation, encoding a dna polymerase primase complex with altered stability, has a single base pair substitution that changes the glycine at position to a positively charged arginine. protein sequence comparison with other prokaryotic and eukaryotic dna polymerases reveals three major regions of homology. this observation suggests that certain dna polymerases might require the conservation of critical amino acid residues for activity.
