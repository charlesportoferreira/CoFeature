mms protects against replication dependent dna damage in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a series of yeast mutants were isolated that are sensitive to killing by the monofunctional dna alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (mms) but not by uv or x radiation. we have cloned and characterized one of the corresponding genes, mms, and show that the mms delta mutant is dramatically sensitive to killing by mms and mildly sensitive to uv radiation. mms delta mutants display an elevated level of spontaneous dna damage and genomic instability. furthermore, the mms delta cells are sensitive to killing by conditions that induce replication dependent double strand breaks, such as treatment with camptothecin, and incubation of a cdc strain at the restrictive temperature. rad delta is epistatic to mms delta for mms and camptothecin sensitivity, indicating that mms acts in concert with rad. however, unlike mutants of the rad group, mms delta cells are not sensitive to gamma rays, which induce double strand breaks independently of dna replication. together these results suggest a role for an mms dependent, rad mediated, pathway in protecting cells against replication dependent dna damage.
