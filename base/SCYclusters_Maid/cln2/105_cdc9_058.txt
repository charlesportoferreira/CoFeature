spontaneous mitotic recombination in mms , an allele of the cdc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the methyl methane sulfonate (mms) sensitive mutation mms increases the rate of spontaneous mitotic intragenic recombination at five heteroallelic loci on three chromosomes. complementation, segregation, and mapping studies indicate that mms is allelic to cdc, known to be defective in deoxyribonucleic acid ligase. both mms and cdc mutants are lethal in combination with the recombination defective mutant rad . genetic analysis of spontaneous red/white sectors in an ade /ade ade/+ mms /mms strain shows nonreciprocal recombinational events involving long chromosome segments. we also observe greater than expected rates of simultaneous recombination at loci on different chromosomes in both wild type and mms mutants.
