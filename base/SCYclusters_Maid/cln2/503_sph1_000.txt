role of a ubiquitin like modification in polarized morphogenesis.. . type i ubiquitin like proteins constitute a family of protein modifiers. here we report the identification of a posttranslational protein modifier from saccharomyces cerevisiae, hub. overexpression of hub resulted in enhanced conjugate formation when its carboxyl terminal residue was deleted, suggesting that mature hub may be produced by proteolytic processing. in vivo targets of hub conjugation included cell polarity factors sph and hbt. in the hubdelta mutant, the subcellular localization of both hbt and sph was disrupted, and cell polarization during the formation of mating projections was defective. consistent with these polarization defects, the hubdelta mutant was deficient in mating.
