the yeast kinase swe is required for proper entry into cell cycle after arrest due to ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis defects.. . sda is an essential protein required for cell cycle progression in saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, we show that the sda mutation causes a defect in the formation and nuclear export of s ribosomal subunits. moreover, the sda , but also other mutants defective in ribosome biogenesis (e.g., rix and tifdelta), exhibit a g() arrest, which could be the consequence of impaired ribosome biogenesis. interestingly, additional deletion of the non essential swe kinase, the homolog of s. pombe wee, causes a pronounced delay in entering a new cell cycle in sda , rix and tifdelta cells, when shifted back from restrictive to permissive conditions. however, such a prolonged delay is independent of the tyr phosphorylation in cdc. moreover, the lack of swe causes delay in budding and dna replication in cells released from the g() arrest due to the block of protein synthesis. our data suggest that swe is required for timely entry into cell cycle after a g() arrest caused by impairment in pre s biogenesis and in protein synthesis. therefore we propose that swe, which is required for coordination of cell growth and cell division in g()/m, also has a role in the beginning of the cell cycle.
