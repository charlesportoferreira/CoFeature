a . kb segment on the left arm of yeast chromosome xv contains more than twice as many unknown as known open reading frames.. . the nucleotide sequence of a . kb fragment localized on the left arm of chromosome xv from saccharomyces cerevisiae has been determined. the sequence contains open reading frames (orfs) of which four encode the known genes adh, coq, msh and rcf. predictions are made concerning the functions of the unknown orfs. some of the orfs contain sequences similar to expressed sequence tags (est) found in the database made available by tigr. in particular, the highly expressed adh gene is represented in this database by no less than est sequences. two ars sequences and a putative functional gcn motif have also been detected. one orf (o) containing nine putative transmembrane segments is similar to a hypothetical membrane protein of arabidopsis thaliana. characteristic features of the other orfs include atp/gtp binding sites, a fungal zn() cys() binuclear centre, an endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence, a beta transducin repeat signature and in two instances, good similarity to the prokaryotic lipoprotein signal peptide motif.
