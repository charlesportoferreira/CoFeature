dissection of the functions of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad postreplicative repair group in mutagenesis and uv sensitivity.. . the rad postreplicative repair group participates in various processes of dna metabolism. to elucidate the contribution of rad to starvation associated mutagenesis, which occurs in nongrowing cells cultivated under selective conditions, we analyzed the phenotype of strains expressing various alleles of the rad gene and single and multiple mutants of the rad, rad, rad, rev, and mms genes from the rad repair group. our results show that the rad repair pathway is also active in starving cells and its contribution to starvation associated mutagenesis is similar to that of spontaneous mutagenesis. epistatic analysis based on both spontaneous and starvation associated mutagenesis and uv sensitivity showed that the rad repair group consists of distinct repair pathways of different relative importance requiring, besides the presence of rad, also either rad or rad or both. we postulate the existence of four pathways. () nonmutagenic rad/rad/rad, () mutagenic rad/rad /rev, () mutagenic rad/rad/rev, and () rad/rad/rad. furthermore, we show that the high mutation rate observed in rad mutants is caused by a mutator different from rev. from our data and data previously published, we suggest a role for rad in dna repair and mutagenesis and propose a model for the rad postreplicative repair group.
