yeast cell cycle mutant cdc is a temperature sensitive thymidylate auxotroph.. . genetic tests with the yeast cell cycle mutant cdc isolated by hartwell indicate that the cdc gene in yeast is the same as the tmp gene, whose mutant alleles confer an auxotrophic requirement for thymidine ' monophosphate (dtmp). yeast strains carrying cdc can grow at degrees in the presence of dtmp provided that they are premeable to this compound. the gene is shown to be linked to ade on chr. xv, and a case of intragenic complementation between cdc and another tmp allele is reported.
