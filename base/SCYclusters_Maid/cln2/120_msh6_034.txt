removal of frameshift intermediates by mismatch repair proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . frameshift mutations occur when the coding region of a gene is altered by addition or deletion of a number of base pairs that is not a multiple of three. the occurrence of a deletion versus an insertion type of frameshift depends on the nature of the transient intermediate structure formed during dna synthesis. extrahelical bases on the template strand give rise to deletions, whereas extrahelical bases on the strand being synthesized produce insertions. we previously used reversion of a + frameshift mutation to analyze the role of the mismatch repair (mmr) machinery in correcting frameshift intermediates within a defined region of the yeast lys gene. in this study, we have used reversion of a frameshift mutation within the same region of lys to analyze the role of the mmr machinery in the correction of frameshift intermediates that give rise to insertion events. we found that insertion and deletion events occur at similar rates but that the reversion spectra are very different in both the wild type and mmr defective backgrounds. in addition, analysis of the + spectra revealed novel roles for mshp and mshp in removing specific types of frameshift intermediates.
