uv mutagenesis in radiation sensitive strains of yeast.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae appears to possess a single mutagenic or &quot;error prony&quot; pathway for the repair of uv damage; rev, rev, rev (lemontt a), rad, rad, rad and rad (lawrence et al. ; present results). strains carrying rad are the most sensitive to the lethal effects of uv light in this group and double mutants carrying rad and either rev, rev, rad or rad are no more sensitive than this single mutant strain, rev rad doubl mutant diploids failed to show any uv induced reversion of the normally highly reversion of the normally highly revertible ochre allele cycl , even though a total of more than . x () viable cells was examined, suggesting that strains of this kind are entirely uv immutable; spontaneous revertants could be recovered, however. the rad and rev gene products would appear to be necessary for all kinds of mutagenic events at all sites within the genome, but the products of the other genes that act in the &quot;error prone&quot; pathway have a more restricted role and are involved in the production of only some kinds of mutations. it is suggested that such selectivity arises from the interaction of some repair enzymes with specific nucleotide sequences.
