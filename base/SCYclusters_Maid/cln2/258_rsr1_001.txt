localization of the rsr/bud gtpase involved in selection of a proper growth site in yeast.. . yeast cells organize their actin cytoskeleton in a highly polarized manner during vegetative growth. the ras like gtpase rsr/bud and its regulators are required for selection of a specific site for growth. here we showed that rsr/bud was broadly distributed on the plasma membrane and highly concentrated at the incipient bud site and polarized growth sites. we also showed that localization of cdc, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the cdc gtpase, to the proper bud site was dependent on rsr/bud. surprisingly, rsr/bud also localized to intracellular membranes. a mutation in the lysine repeat in the hypervariable region of rsr/bud specifically abolished its plasma membrane localization, whereas a mutation at the caax motif eliminated both plasma membrane and internal membrane association of rsr/bud. thus the lysine repeat and the caax motif of rsr/bud are important for its localization to the plasma membrane and to the polarized growth sites. this localization of rsr/bud is essential for its function in proper bud site selection because both mutations resulted in random bud site selection.
