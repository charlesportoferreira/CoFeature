directed evolution to bypass cyclin requirements for the cdcp cyclin dependent kinase.. . to identify cyclin dependent kinase mutants with relaxed cyclin requirements, cdc alleles were selected that could rescue a yeast strain expressing as its only cln g cyclin a mutant clnp (ka,ea) that is defective for cdcp binding. rescue of this strain by mutant cdc was dependent upon the mutant cln kaea, but additional mutagenesis and dna shuffling yielded multiply mutant cdc byc alleles (bypass of clns) that could support highly efficient cell cycle initiation in the complete absence of cln genes. by gel filtration chromatography, one of the mutant cdc proteins exhibited kinase activity associated with cyclin free monomer. thus, the mutants' cln bypass activity might result from constitutive, cyclin independent activity, suggesting that cdk targeting by cyclins is not required for cell cycle initiation.
