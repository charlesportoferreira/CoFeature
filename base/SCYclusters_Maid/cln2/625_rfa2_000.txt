sequencing analysis of a . kb fragment of yeast chromosome xiv identifies six known genes, a new member of the hexose transporter family and ten new open reading frames.. . the dna sequence of a . kb region covering the left arm of chromosome xiv from saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined. this region contains open reading frames (orfs) which code for proteins of more than amino acids. five orfs correspond to the kre, atp, dal, rfa and mck loci, described previously. two orfs present high similarity to known proteins. no with the hexose transporter family, and no with the yeast chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase enzyme encoded by pha. six orfs show limited similarity with known proteins or some specific features. no presents potential transmembrane domains. no, which is internal to no, presents a putative signal sequence and a potential transmembrane domain. no shows similarity with ycw, tup and sec. no reveals a signature for a pyridoxal phosphate attachment site. finally, no and no present a biased amino acid composition, being rich in asn or glu/lys/arg, respectively. four other orfs (no, no, no and no) show no similarity to proteins within the databases screened.
