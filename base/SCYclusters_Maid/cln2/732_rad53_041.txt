characterization of the checkpoint gene rad/mec in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae cells carrying mutations in rad/mec fail to arrest in the s phase when dna replication is blocked (the s/m checkpoint) or in the g phase when dna is damaged (the g/m checkpoint). we isolated and determined the dna sequence of rad and found that it is identical to the spk gene previously identified by stern et al. (). in addition to its checkpoint functions, we show here that rad is essential for cell viability because null mutants are inviable. weak genomic suppressors of the essential function do arise frequently, though they do not suppress the checkpoint defects of the null mutant. this genetically separates the essential and checkpoint functions. we show genetically that the protein kinase domain is essential for all rad dependent functions tested because a site specific mutation that inactivates the protein kinase activity results in a mutant phenotype indistinguishable from that of a null mutant. overexpression of rad, or its kinase domain alone, resulted in a delay in cell cycle progression that required the intact kinase function. the cell cycle delay did not require any of the checkpoint genes tested (e.g. rad or mecl), indicating that the cell cycle delay is either unrelated to the checkpoint responses, or that it occurs constitutively because rad acts further downstream of the checkpoint genes tested. finally, elimination of sequences in the promoter region of rad revealed complex regulatory elements.
