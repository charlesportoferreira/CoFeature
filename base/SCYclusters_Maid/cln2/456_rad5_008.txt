the rad gene product is involved in the avoidance of non homologous end joining of dna double strand breaks in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in wild type yeast, the repair of a bp double strand gap induced by the restriction enzymes apai and ncoi in the uragene of the shuttle vector ypja occurs with high fidelity according to the homologous chromosomal sequence. in contrast, only % of the cells of rad and rad delta mutants perform correct gap repair. as has been proven by sequencing of the junction sites, the remaining cells recircularise the gapped plasmids by joining of the non compatible, non homologous ends. thus, regarding the repair of dna double strand breaks, the rad mutants behave like mammalian cells rather than budding yeast. the majority of the end joined plasmids miss either one or both of the 'and 'protruding single strands of the restriction ends completely and have undergone blunt end ligation accompanied by fill in dna synthesis. these results imply an important role for the rad protein (radp) in the protection of protruding single strand ends and for the avoidance of non homologous end joining during repair of double strand gaps in budding yeast. alternatively, the radp may be an accessory factor increasing the efficiency of homologous recombination in yeast, however, the molecular mechanism of radp function requires further investigation.
