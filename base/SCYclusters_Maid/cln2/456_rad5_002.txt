promoter trapping in saccharomyces cerevisiae by radiation assisted fragment insertion.. . non homologous insertion (nhi) of dna fragments into genomic dna is a method widely used in insertional mutagenesis screens. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the efficiency of nhi is very low. here we report that its efficiency can be increased by gamma irradiation of recipient cells at the time of transformation. radiation assisted nhi depends on yku, but its efficiency is not improved by inactivation of rad or rad. in a pilot study, we generated transformant clones expressing a lacz reporter gene under standard conditions ( degrees c, rich medium). the site of insertion was determined in a subset of eight clones in which lacz expression was altered by uv irradiation. a comparison with published data revealed that three of the eight genes identified in our screen have not been targeted by large scale transposon based insertion screens. this suggests that radiation assisted nhi offers a more homogeneous coverage of the genome than methods relying on transposons or retroviral elements.
