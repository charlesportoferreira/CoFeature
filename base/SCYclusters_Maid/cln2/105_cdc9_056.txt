cdc ligase defective mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit lowered resistance to lethal effects of bleomycin.. . conditional ligase deficient mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae were more sensitive than their parental (cdc) strain to dose dependent killing by bleomycin, even when mutant cells were pregrown and exposed to the antibiotic at permissive temperatures. pretreatment incubation at the restrictive temperature ( degrees c) under growing or nongrowing conditions enhanced bleomycin killing of both cdc and cdc mutants. this sensitization could be relieved by incubation at the permissive temperature before treatment.
