hyperactivation of the yeast dna damage checkpoint by tel and ddc overexpression.. . the evolutionarily conserved yeast mec and tel protein kinases, as well as the mec interacting protein ddc, are involved in the dna damage checkpoint response. we show that regulation of tel and ddc mec activities is important to modulate both activation and termination of checkpoint mediated cell cycle arrest. in fact, overproduction of either tel or ddc causes a prolonged cell cycle arrest and cell death in response to dna damage, impairing the ability of cells to recover from checkpoint activation. this cell cycle arrest is independent of mec in uv irradiated tel overproducing cells, while it is strictly mec dependent in similarly treated ddc overexpressing cells. the rad checkpoint kinase is instead required in both cases for cell cycle arrest, which correlates with its enhanced and persistent phosphorylation, suggesting that unscheduled rad phosphorylation might prevent cells from re entering the cell cycle after checkpoint activation. in addition, tel overproduction results in transient nuclear division arrest and concomitant rad phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous dna damage independently of mec and ddc.
