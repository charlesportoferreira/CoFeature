restoration of silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae by tethering of a novel sir interacting protein, esc.. . we previously described two classes of sir mutations specifically defective in either telomeric/hm silencing (class i) or rdna silencing (class ii) in s. cerevisiae. here we report the identification of genes whose protein products, when either overexpressed or directly tethered to the locus in question, can establish silencing in sir class i mutants. elevated dosage of scs, previously implicated as a regulator of both inositol biosynthesis and telomeric silencing, suppressed the dominant negative effect of a sir mutation. in a genetic screen for proteins that restore silencing when tethered to a telomere, we isolated esc and an uncharacterized gene, (yolw), which we call esc. both escp and escp interact with sirp in two hybrid assays, and the escp sir interaction is detected in vitro. interestingly, escp has a single close homolog in yeast, the isw complex factor iocp, and has also been copurified with iswp, raising the possibility that escp is a component of an iswp containing nucleosome remodeling complex. whereas esc and esc deletion mutants alone have only marginal silencing defects, cells lacking iswp show a strong silencing defect at hmr but not at telomeres. finally, we show that escp interacts with the gal protein, a component of the rna pol ii mediator complex.
