genetic and molecular analysis of rec, an early meiotic recombination gene in yeast.. . four new meiotic recombination genes were previously isolated by selecting for mutations that rescue the meiotic lethality of rad spo strains. one of these genes, rec, is described here, and the data confirm that rec is a meiosis specific recombination gene with no detectable function in mitosis. rec is located on chromosome xiii approximately . cm from cin. the nucleotide sequence reveals an open reading frame of bp, consensus intron splice sites close to the ' end, and indicates that the second exon codes for only seven amino acids. in the promoter region, a urs consensus sequence (tgggcggcta), identical to the urs found in the promoter of spo, is present bp upstream of the translation start site. northern blot hybridization demonstrates that rec is transcribed only during meiosis and that it is not expressed in the absence of the ime gene product, even when ime is constitutively expressed.
