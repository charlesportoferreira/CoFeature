an activator/repressor dual system allows tight tetracycline regulated gene expression in budding yeast.. . we have developed an activator/repressor expression system for budding yeast in which tetracyclines control in opposite ways the ability of tetr based activator and repressor molecules to bind teto promoters. this combination allows tight expression of teto driven genes, both in a direct (tetracycline repressible) and reverse (tetracycline inducible) dual system. ssn and tup, that are components of a general repressor complex in yeast, have been tested for their repressing properties in the dual system, using lacz and cln as reporter genes. ssn gives better results and allows complete switching off of the regulated genes, although increasing the levels of the tup based repressor by expressing it from a stronger promoter improves repressing efficiency of the latter. effector mediated shifts between expression and non expression conditions are rapid. the dual system here described may be useful for the functional analysis of essential genes whose conditional expression can be tightly controlled by tetracyclines.
