identification and cloning of two histone fold motif containing subunits of hela dna polymerase epsilon.. . hela dna polymerase epsilon (pol epsilon), possibly involved in both dna replication and dna repair, was previously isolated as a complex of a kda catalytic subunit and a tightly bound kda accessory protein. saccharomyces cerevisiae pol epsilon, however, consists of four subunits. a kda catalytic subunit with % identity to hela pol epsilon p, a kda subunit (dpb) with % identity to hela pol epsilon p, a kda subunit (dpb), and a kda subunit (dpb). we report here the identification and the cloning of two additional subunits of hela pol epsilon, p, and p. both proteins contain histone fold motifs which are present also in s. cerevisiae dpb and dpb. the histone fold motifs of p and dpb are related to that of subunit a of the ccaat binding factor, whereas the histone fold motifs found in p and dpb are homologous to that in subunit c of ccaat binding factor. p together with p, but not p or p alone, interact with both p and p subunits of hela pol epsilon. the genes for p and p can be assigned to chromosome locations q and p, respectively.
