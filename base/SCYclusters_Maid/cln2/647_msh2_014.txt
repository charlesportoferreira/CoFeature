mutations in rad, msh, and rad affect the rate of gene amplification in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we report here the use of the adh.cup amplification detection system to identify five high amplification rate (har) strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae that display to fold higher amplification rates than those of parental strains. we have identified a mutation in rad dna repair helicase gene in har strain b that results in a fold increase in amplification rate. rad is the functional homolog of the human xpd gene, suggesting that this model system will provide important candidates for genes that affect gene amplification in human cells. isolation of the har strains has allowed us to test whether rad, which is essential for recombinational repair of dna double strand breaks, is also essential for amplification. deletion of rad in har strains b and b decreases amplification approximately fold. in contrast, deletion of msh, which increases recombination between sequences with limited similarity, increases the amplification rate about fold. these results suggest that recombination is an important step in amplification. copyright wiley liss, inc.
