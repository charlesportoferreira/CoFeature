differential assembly of cdcp and dna polymerases at early and late origins of dna replication.. . chromosomes are replicated in characteristic, temporal patterns during s phase. we have compared the timing of association of replication proteins at early and late replicating origins of replication. minichromosome maintenance proteins assemble simultaneously at early and late replicating origins. in contrast, cdcp association with late origins is delayed relative to early origins. dna polymerase alpha association is similarly delayed at late origins and requires cdcp function. activation of the s phase checkpoint inhibits association of cdcp with late firing origins. these studies suggest that cdcp is poised to serve as a key regulatory target for both the temporal and checkpoint mediated regulation of replication origins.
