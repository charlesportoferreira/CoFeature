enhanced mitotic recombination in a ligase defective mutant of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the temperature sensitive saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle mutant cdc is defective in dna ligase, and the dna synthesized at the restrictive temperature contains many single strand breaks. we find that holding a diploid homozygous for cdc at the restrictive temperature and then plating cells at the permissive temperature gives rise to increased intragenic and intergenic recombination. in the latter case, recombinants signaled by the ade locus rise to about % of the survivors after hr of incubation at the restrictive temperature. we propose that the single strand breaks left in dna synthesized at the restrictive temperature may lead to recombination.
