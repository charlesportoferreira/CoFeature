an in vitro assay for saccharomyces telomerase requires est.. . telomerase activity was demonstrated in cell free extracts from s. cerevisiae through the use of a pcr based assay. as expected, this activity was eliminated by rnase or phenol treatment of the extract and was dependent on dgtp and dttp. telomerase was not detected in extracts prepared from cells grown for approximately or more cell divisions in the absence of the est product, estp. tlc rna, which determines the sequence of telomeric dna in vivo, was present in normal amounts in est delta cells. moreover, tlc rna specifically precipitated with epitope tagged estp. these data indicate that estp is either a subunit of yeast telomerase or an accessory protein associated with telomerase that is essential in vitro for its activity.
