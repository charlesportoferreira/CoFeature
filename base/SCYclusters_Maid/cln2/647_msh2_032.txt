a carboxy terminal domain of the hmsh gene product is sufficient for binding specific mismatched oligonucleotides.. . the human msh gene product is a member of a highly conserved family of proteins which are involved in post replication mismatch repair. hmsh is homologous to escherichia coli (e. coli) muts and sacchromyces cerevisiae msh and msh proteins, which recognise heteroduplex dna at the sites of all single base mismatches and deletions or insertions up to base pairs. hmsh is one of the hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) tumor suppressor genes, and maps to human chromosome p. alterations in the coding region of the hmsh gene result in a mutator phenotype with marked instability of microsatellite sequences, indicative of a deficiency in dna repair. it has been shown that purified hmsh binds specifically to nucleotide mismatches in double stranded dna. here we demonstrate that a region of high homology between the members of this class of proteins contains a type a nucleotide binding site consensus sequence which has atpase activity and is sufficient to bind dna containing specific mismatched residues.
