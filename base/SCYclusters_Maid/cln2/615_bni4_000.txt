novel interactions of saccharomyces cerevisiae type protein phosphatase identified by single step affinity purification and mass spectrometry.. . the catalytic subunit of saccharomyces cerevisiae type protein phosphatase (pp(c)) is encoded by the essential gene glc and is involved in regulating diverse cellular processes. to identify potential regulatory or targeting subunits of yeast pp(c), we tagged glcp at its amino terminus with protein a and affinity purified glcp protein complexes from yeast. the purified proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds page) and identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) mass spectrometry. to confirm the accuracy of our identifications, peptides from some of the proteins were also sequenced using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. only four of the glcp associated proteins that we identified (mhpp, bnip, refp, and sdsp) have previously been shown to interact with glcp, and multiple components of the cpf (cleavage and polyadenylation factor) complex involved in messenger rna ' end processing were present as major components in the glcp associated protein fraction. to confirm the interaction of glcp with this complex, we used the same approach to purify and characterize the components of the yeast cpf complex using protein a tagged ptap. six known components of the yeast (cpf) complex, together with glcp, were identified among the ptap associated polypeptides using peptide mass fingerprint analysis. thus glcp is a novel component of the cpf complex and may therefore be involved regulating mrna ' end processing.
