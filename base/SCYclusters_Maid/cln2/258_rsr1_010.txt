two subclasses of guanine exchange factor (gef) domains revealed by comparison of activities of chimeric genes constructed from cdc, sdc and bud in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . guanine exchange factor (gef) activity for ras proteins has been associated with a conserved domain in cdcp, sdcp in saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other proteins recently found in other eukaryotes. we have assessed the structure function relationships between three different members of this family in s. cerevisiae, cdcp, sdcp and budp. cdcp controls the ras pathway, whereas budp controls bud site localization. we demonstrate that the gef domain of sdcp is closely related to that of cdcp. we first constructed a thermosensitive allele of sdc by specifically altering amino acid positions known to be changed in the cdc mutation. secondly, we constructed three chimeric genes from cdc and sdc, the products of which are as active in the ras pathway as are the wild type proteins. in contrast, similar chimeras made between cdc and bud lead to proteins that are inactive both in the ras and budding control pathways. this difference in the ability of chimeric proteins to retain activity allows us to define two subclasses of structurally different gefs. cdcp and sdcp are ras specific gefs, and budp is a putative gef for the rsr/bud rap like protein.
