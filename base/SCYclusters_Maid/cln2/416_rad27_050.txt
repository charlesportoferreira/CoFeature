human ercc cdna cosmid complementation for excision repair and bipartite amino acid domains conserved with rad proteins of saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . several human genes related to dna excision repair (er) have been isolated via er cross species complementation (ercc) of uv sensitive cho cells. we have now isolated and characterized cdnas for the human ercc gene that complement cho uv cells. the ercc mrna size is about . kb. our available cdna clones are partial length, and no single clone was active for uv complementation. when cdnas were mixed pairwise with a cosmid clone containing an overlapping ' end segment of the ercc gene, dna transfer produced uv resistant colonies with to % correction of uv resistance relative to either a genomic ercc dna transformant or the cho aa progenitor cells. cdna cosmid transformants regained intermediate levels ( to %) of er dependent reactivation of a uv damaged psvcatgpt reporter plasmid. our evidence strongly implicates an in situ recombination mechanism in cdna cosmid complementation for er. the complete deduced amino acid sequence of ercc was reconstructed from several cdna clones encoding a predicted protein of , amino acids. the ercc protein has extensive sequence similarities, in bipartite domains a and b, to products of rad repair genes of two yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae rad and schizosaccharomyces pombe rad. sequence, structural, and functional data taken together indicate that ercc and its relatives are probable functional homologs. a second locus represented by s. cerevisiae ykl and s. pombe rad genes is structurally distinct from the ercc locus but retains vestigial a and b domain similarities. our analyses suggest that ercc is a nuclear localized protein with one or more highly conserved helix loop helix segments within domains a and b.
