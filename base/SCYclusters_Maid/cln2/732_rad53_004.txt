diverse but overlapping functions of the two forkhead associated (fha) domains in rad checkpoint kinase activation.. . forkhead associated (fha) domains are phosphothreonine binding modules prevalent in proteins with important cell cycle and dna damage response functions. the yeast checkpoint kinase rad is unique in containing two fha domains. we have generated novel recessive rad alleles with abolished fha domain functions resulting from ala substitution of the critical phosphothreonine binding residues arg and arg. in asynchronous cells, inactivation of the n terminal fha domain did not impair rad activation and downstream functions, whereas inactivation of the c terminal fha domain led to reduced rad activation and significantly increased dna damage sensitivity. simultaneous inactivation of both fha domains abolished rad activation and all downstream functions and dramatically increased the sensitivity to dna damage and replication blocks similar to kinase defective and rad null alleles, but did not compromise the essential viability function of rad. interestingly, in g/m synchronized cells, mutation of either fha domain prevented rad activation and impaired the cell cycle arrest checkpoint. our data demonstrate that both fha domains are required for normal rad functions and indicate that the two fha domains have differential but partially overlapping roles in rad activation and downstream signaling.
