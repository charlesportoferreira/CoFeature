isolation of the gene encoding yeast dna polymerase i.. . a yeast genomic dna expression library in lambda gt antibody prepared against yeast dna polymerase i were used to isolate the gene encoding dna polymerase i. the identity of the dna polymerase i gene was determined by several criteria. first, the clone encoded protein is immunologically related to dna polymerase i. second, cells containing the gene cloned in the high copy number plasmid yep overproduce the polymerase activity to fold as measured in yeast extracts. finally, insertion of the gene downstream from a bacteriophage t promoter allows synthesis of yeast dna polymerase i in escherichia coli. gene disruption and southern hybridization experiments show that the polymerase is encoded by an essential, single copy gene. examination of the germinated spores containing the disrupted gene reveals a defect in nuclear division and a terminal phenotype typical of replication mutants.
