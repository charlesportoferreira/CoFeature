the sequence of kb surrounding the snf locus on the left arm of yeast chromosome iv reveals the location of five known genes and characterizes at least six new open reading frames including putative genes for ribosomal protein l and a sugar transport protein.. . the nucleotide sequence of , bp of the left arm of chromosome iv is described. twelve open reading frames (orfs) greater than triplets were detected, one of which extends into an adjacent cosmid. two of the orfs may contain an intron. one of these is an l ribosomal protein gene. five orfs (d, d, d, d and d) encode previously sequenced genes (mgt, shm, asf, snf and arf, respectively). the nucleotide sequence of a sixth orf (d) is quite similar to the web gene, which appeared in the dna databases shortly after finishing the sequence reported here. it is not clear whether or not web and d represent one and the same gene. the co linearity of the reported dna sequences with the genome of strains from saccharomyces cerevisiae subspecies carlsbergensis, sake and diastaticus was assessed by comparative pcr with overlapping primer sets.
