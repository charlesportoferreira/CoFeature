regulation of the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme hhra by cdk mediated phosphorylation.. . cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is mediated by phosphorylation of protein substrates by the cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). we screened a cdna library by solid phase phosphorylation and isolated hhra as a cdk substrate. hhra is the human homologue of the product of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad/ubc gene, a member of the family of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. hhra is phosphorylated in vitro by cdk and on ser, a residue conserved in all hhra homologues, resulting in a fold increase in its ubiquitin conjugating activity. in vivo, hhra phosphorylation peaks during the g/m phase of cell cycle transition, with a concomitant increase in histone hb ubiquitylation. mutation of ser to threonine or alanine abolished hhra activity, while mutation to aspartate to mimic phosphorylated serine increased hhra activity fold. genetic complementation studies in s.cerevisiae demonstrated that hhra ser is critical for cellular proliferation. this is the first study to demonstrate regulation of ubc function by phosphorylation on a conserved residue and suggests that cdk mediated phosphorylation of hhra is an important regulatory event in the control of cell cycle progression.
