telomere maintenance in fission yeast requires an est ortholog.. . telomerase regulation is critical to genome maintenance yet remains poorly understood. without telomerase's ability to synthesize telomere repeats, chromosome ends shorten progressively, as conventional dna polymerases cannot fully replicate the ends of linear molecules. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomerase activity in vivo absolutely depends on a set of telomerase accessory proteins that includes estp, which appears to recruit or activate telomerase at the site of polymerization. thus, estdelta cells have the same cellular senescence phenotype as cells lacking either the catalytic protein subunit of telomerase or its template containing rna subunit. while the telomerase protein is highly conserved among eukaryotes, the apparent lack of estp homologs has frustrated efforts to describe a common mechanism of telomerase recruitment and activation. here, we describe spestp, a homolog of estp from the evolutionarily distant schizosaccharomyces pombe. like scestp, spestp is required for telomerase activity in vivo. coupled with the identification of an orthologous est protein in humans [], this suggests a much wider conservation of telomerase regulation than was previously known. strikingly, in cells with compromised telomere function (tazdelta), spestp loss confers a lethal germination phenotype, while telomerase loss does not, indicating that spestp plays an unexpected additional role in chromosome end protection.
