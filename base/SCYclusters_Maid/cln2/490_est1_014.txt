stm, a gene which encodes a guanine quadruplex binding protein, interacts with cdc in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cdc gene encodes a protein that binds to the g rich single strand at yeast telomeres, and serves as a regulator of telomere replication. cdc interacts with est and dna polymerase alpha, and cells carrying the temperature sensitive allele cdc cannot complete telomere replication at the restrictive temperature and possess long telomeres. we attempted to isolate and characterize genes that interact with cdc, in order to clarify the molecular mechanisms of telomere replication. a stm cdna was isolated in a two hybrid screen using cdc as a bait. the temperature sensitive growth phenotype and the alteration in telomere size in cdc cells were corrected by introduction of the stm gene on a multicopy vector, but the extended g rich single strand overhangs which are also characteristic in the cdc mutant were not affected. furthermore, we found that multiple copies of sgs, a gene encoding a helicase that can unwind guanine quadruplexes, inhibited suppression of the cdc phenotype by stm. we also demonstrate that a fusion protein consisting of the n terminal region of cdc and the c terminal region of stm (which shows similarity to the beta subunit of the telomere binding complex in oxytricha) could complement a cdc disruptant. although stm itself is not essential for telomere replication, our findings suggest that stm genetically interacts with cdc to maintain telomere structure.
