borrelidin inhibits a cyclin dependent kinase (cdk), cdc/cln, of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we identified borrrelidin, a member of macrolide antibiotic, as an inhibitor of a cyclin dependent kinase of the budding yeast, cdc/cln. a % inhibition concentration (ic) of borrelidin for cdc/cln was microm. in addition, borrelidin arrests both haploid and diploid cells in g phase at the point indistinguishable from that of alpha mating pheromone, at concentrations not affecting the gross protein synthesis. although the inhibition of cdk activity may not be a solo cause of the g arrest, our results indicate that borrelidin is a potential lead compound for developing novel cdk inhibitors of higher eukaryotes.
