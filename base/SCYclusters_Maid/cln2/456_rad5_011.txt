yeast dna repair protein rad that promotes instability of simple repetitive sequences is a dna dependent atpase.. . the rad gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae functions in postreplication repair of ultraviolet damaged dna, and interestingly, it also has a role in increasing the instability of simple repetitive sequences in the genome. in contrast to dna mismatch repair genes which function in maintaining constant length of repeat sequences, rad promotes alterations in the length of repeat sequences. in this work, we purify the rad protein to near homogeneity from yeast cells and show that it is a single stranded dna dependent atpase. the possible roles of rad atpase in postreplication gap filling and in increasing the incidence of length alterations of repeat sequences are discussed.
