replication protein a mediated recruitment and activation of rad complexes.. . the human rad rfc and rad rad hus complexes play crucial roles in the activation of the atr mediated dna damage and dna replication stress response pathways. in response to dna damage, rad is recruited to chromatin in a rad dependent manner in human cells. however, the dna structures recognized by the rad rfc complex during the damage response have not been defined. here, we show that replication protein a (rpa) stimulates the binding of the rad rfc complex to single stranded dna (ssdna), primed ssdna, and a gapped dna structure. furthermore, rpa facilitates the recruitment of the rad rad hus complex by the rad rfc complex to primed and gapped dna structures in vitro. these findings suggest that rpa coated ssdna is an important part of the structures recognized by the rad rfc complex. unlike replication factor c (rfc), which uses the ' primer/template junction to recruit proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), the rad rfc complex can use both the ' and the ' primer/template junctions to recruit the rad rad hus complex, and it shows a preference for gapped dna structures. these results explain how the rad rfc complex senses dna damage and dna replication stress to initiate checkpoint signaling.
