candida albicans cdc interacts with the crk kinase and is required for crk production.. . crk, a cdc related protein kinase from the human pathogenic fungus candida albicans, plays an important role in hyphal development and virulence. to address its regulatory mechanisms, we searched for crk interacting proteins by two hybrid screening. a cdc ortholog (cacdc) was cloned from the screening with the crk kinase domain as the bait. the cacdc interacted preferentially with the kinase domain of crk (crkn) as shown by two hybrid and immunoprecipitation experiments. cacdc could complement a cdc thermosensitive mutant (cdc ) of saccharomyces cerevisiae. importantly, crk protein was hardly detectable in the cdc mutant at restrictive temperature. however, upon expression of cacdc in the cdc mutant, crk protein was detected even at restrictive temperature. our data suggested that cacdc was required for the production of crk kinase. like cdc proteins of s. cerevisiae and higher eukaryotes, cacdc might function as a molecular chaperone that stabilized crk and other protein kinases in c. albicans. in support of this, casti was identified from a two hybrid screen with the full length crk as the bait. casti showed two hybrid interactions with both crk and the cacdc.
