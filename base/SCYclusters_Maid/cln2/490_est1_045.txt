nucleolar protein pinxp regulates telomerase by sequestering its protein catalytic subunit in an inactive complex lacking telomerase rna.. . human trf binding protein pinx inhibits telomerase activity. here we report that overexpression of yeast pinxp (ypinxp) results in shortened telomeres and decreased in vitro telomerase activity. ypinxp coimmunoprecipitated with yeast telomerase protein estp even in cells lacking the telomerase rna tlc, or the telomerase associated proteins estp and estp. estp regions required for binding to ypinxp or tlc were similar. furthermore, we found two distinct estp complexes exist, containing either ypinxp or tlc. levels of estp ypinxp complex increased when tlc was deleted and decreased when tlc was overexpressed. hence, we propose that ypinxp regulates telomerase by sequestering its protein catalytic subunit in an inactive complex lacking telomerase rna.
