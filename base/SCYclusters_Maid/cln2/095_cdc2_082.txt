saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc mutants fail to replicate approximately one third of their nuclear genome.. . chromosomal dna replication was examined in temperature sensitive mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in a gene required for the completion of s phase at the nonpermissive temperature, degrees c. based on incorporation of radioactive precursors and density transfer experiments, strains carrying three different alleles of cdc failed to replicate approximately one third of their nuclear genome at degrees c. whole cell autoradiography experiments demonstrated that to % of the cells synthesized dna at degrees c. therefore, all cells failed to replicate part of their genome. dna isolated from terminally arrested cells was of normal size as measured on neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients, suggesting that partially replicated dna molecules do not accumulate and that dna strands are ligated properly in cdc mutants. in addition, electron microscopic examination of the equivalent of more than one genome's dna from arrested cells failed to reveal any partially replicated molecules. the sequences which failed to replicate at degrees c were not highly specific; eight different cloned sequences replicated to the same extent as total dna. the microns plasmid dna and rdna replicated significantly less well than total dna, but approximately one half of these sequences replicated at degrees c. these observations suggest that cdc mutants are defective in an aspect of initiation of dna replication common to all chromosomes such that a random fraction of the chromosomes fail to initiate replication at degrees c, but that once initiated, replication proceeds normally.
