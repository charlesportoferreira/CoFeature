essential regions of saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase rna. separate elements for estp and estp interaction.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase rna subunit is encoded by the tlc gene. a selection for viable alleles of tlc rna from a large library of random deletion alleles revealed that less than half (approximately . kb of the approximately . kb rna) is required for telomerase function in vivo. the main essential region ( nucleotides), which contains the template for telomeric dna synthesis, was required for coimmunoprecipitation with estp and estp. furthermore, the subregion required for interaction with estp, the telomerase recruitment subunit, differed from those required for interaction with estp, the reverse transcriptase subunit. two regions of the rna distant from the template in the nucleotide sequence were required for estp binding, but the template itself was not. having the rna secured to the protein away from the template is proposed to facilitate the translocation of the rna template through the active site. more generally, our results support a role for the telomerase rna serving as a scaffold for binding key protein subunits.
