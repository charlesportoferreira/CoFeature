thymidine utilization by tut mutants and facile cloning of mutant alleles by plasmid conversion in s. cerevisiae.. . plasmid pjm contains a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene that is expressed in yeast. cells containing the plasmid utilize thymidine (tdr) and the analogue bromodeoxyuridine (budr) for specific incorporation into dna. tdr auxotrophs, harboring plasmid pjm and a mutation in the yeast gene tmp require high concentrations of tdr ( micrograms/ml) to support normal growth rates and the wild type mitochondrial genome (rho+) cannot be maintained. we have identified a yeast gene, tut, in which recessive mutations allow efficient utilization of lower concentrations of tdr. strains containing the mutations tmp and tut, as well as plasmid pjm, form colonies at micrograms/ml tdr, grow at nearly normal rates and maintain the rho+ genome at micrograms/ml tdr. these strains can be used to radiolabel dna specifically and to synchronize dna replication by tdr starvation. in addition, the substitution of budr for tdr allows the selective killing of dna synthesizing cells by nm irradiation and allows the separation of replicated and unreplicated forms of dna by cscl equilibrium density banding. we also describe a unique, generally applicable system for cloning mutant alleles that exploits the fact that tk+ yeast cells are sensitive to fluorodeoxyuridine (fudr) and that gene conversions can occur between a yeast chromosome and a tk containing plasmid.
