in yeast, the pseudohyphal phenotype induced by isoamyl alcohol results from the operation of the morphogenesis checkpoint.. . isoamyl alcohol (iaa) induces a phenotype that resembles pseudohyphae in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. we show here that iaa causes the rapid formation of linear chains of anucleate buds, each of which is accompanied by the formation of a septin ring at its neck. this process requires the activity of swe and slt (mpk). cdc is phosphorylated on tyrosine in a swe dependent manner, while slt becomes activated by dual tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation. tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc is not dependent on slt. however, the defective response in the sltdelta mutant is rescued by an mihdelta mutation. the iaa response still occurs in a cell containing a dominant non phosphorylatable form of cdc, but no longer occurs in an mihdelta sltdelta mutant containing this form of cdc. these observations show that iaa induces the swe dependent morphogenesis checkpoint and so the resulting pseudohyphal phenotype arises in an entirely different way from the formation of pseudohyphae induced by nitrogen limited growth.
