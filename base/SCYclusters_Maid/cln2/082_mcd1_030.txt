chromosomal addresses of the cohesin component mcdp.. . we identified the chromosomal addresses of a cohesin subunit, mcdp, in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high resolution pcr based chromosomal walking. the mapping of new mcdp binding sites (cohesin associated regions [cars]) in single copy sequences of several chromosomes establish their spacing ( approximately kb), their sequestration to intergenic regions, and their association with at rich sequences as general genomic properties of cars. we show that cohesins are not excluded from telomere proximal regions, and the enrichment of cohesins at the centromere at mitosis reflects de novo loading. the average size of a car is . . kb. they lie at the boundaries of transcriptionally silenced regions, suggesting they play a direct role in defining the silent chromatin domain. finally, we identify cars in tandem (rdna) and interspersed repetitive dna (ty and subtelomeric repeats). each kb rdna repeat has a single car proximal to the s gene. thus, the periodicity of cars in single copy regions and the rdna repeats is conserved. the presence and spacing of cars in repetitive dna has important implications for genomic stability and chromosome packaging/condensation.
