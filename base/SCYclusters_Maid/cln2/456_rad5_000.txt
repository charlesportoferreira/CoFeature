yeast mph gene functions in an error free dna damage bypass pathway that requires genes from homologous recombination, but not from postreplicative repair.. . the mph gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding a member of the deah family of proteins, had been identified by virtue of the spontaneous mutator phenotype of respective deletion mutants. genetic analysis suggested that mph functions in a previously uncharacterized dna repair pathway that protects the cells from damage induced mutations. we have now analyzed genetic interactions of mph with a variety of mutants from different repair systems with respect to spontaneous mutation rates and sensitivities to different dna damaging agents. the dependence of the mph mutator phenotype on rev and rev and the synergy with mutations in base and nucleotide excision repair suggest an involvement of mph in error free bypass of lesions. however, although we observed an unexpected partial suppression of the mph mutator phenotype by rad, genetic interactions with other mutations in postreplicative repair imply that mph does not belong to this pathway. instead, mutations from the homologous recombination pathway were found to be epistatic to mph with respect to both spontaneous mutation rates and damage sensitivities. determination of spontaneous mitotic recombination rates demonstrated that mph mutants are not deficient in homologous recombination. on the contrary, in an sgs background we found a pronounced hyperrecombination phenotype. thus, we propose that mph is involved in a branch of homologous recombination that is specifically dedicated to error free bypass.
