the atm related tel protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae controls a checkpoint response following phleomycin treatment.. . mec and tel encode atr and atm related proteins in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. phleomycin is an agent that catalyzes double strand breaks in dna. we show here that both mec and tel regulate the checkpoint response following phleomycin treatment. mec is required for rad phosphorylation and cell cycle progression delay following phleomycin treatment in g, s or g/m phases. the teldelta mutation confers a defect in the checkpoint responses to phleomycin treatment in s phase. in addition, the teldelta mutation enhances the mec defect in activation of the phleomycin induced checkpoint pathway in s phase. in contrast, the teldelta mutation confers only a minor defect in the checkpoint responses in g phase and no apparent defect in g/m phase. methyl methanesulfonate (mms) treatment also activates checkpoints, inducing rad phosphorylation in s phase. mms induced rad phosphorylation is not detected in mecdelta mutants during s phase, but occurs in teldelta mutants similar to wild type cells. finally, xrs is phosphorylated after phleomycin treatment in a tel dependent manner during s phase, whereas no significant xrs phosphorylation is detected after mms treatment. together, our results support a model in which tel contributes to checkpoint control in response to phleomycin induced dna damage in s phase.
