analysis of mutagenic dna repair in a thermoconditional mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae. iii. dose response pattern of mutation induction in uv irradiated revts cells.. . recent studies regarding the influence of cycloheximide on the temperature dependent increase in survival and mutation frequencies of a thermoconditional rev mutant lead to the suggestion that the rev coded mutagenic repair function is uv inducible. in the present study we show that stationary phase revts cells are characterized by a biphasic linear quadratic dose dependence of mutation induction (&quot;mutation kinetics&quot;) of ochre alleles at degrees c (permissive temperature) but linear kinetics at the restrictive temperature of degrees c. mathematical analysis using a model based on poisson statistics and a further mathematical procedure, the calculation of &quot;apparent survival&quot;, support the assumption that the quadratic component of the reverse mutation kinetics investigated can be attributed to a uv inducible component of mutagenic dna repair controlled by the rev gene.
