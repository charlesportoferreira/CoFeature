the rad (fen ) nuclease inhibits ty mobility in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . although most ty elements in saccharomyces cerevisiae are competent for retrotransposition, host defense genes can inhibit different steps of the ty life cycle. here, we demonstrate that rad, a structure specific nuclease that plays an important role in dna replication and genome stability, inhibits ty at a post translational level. we have examined the effects of various rad mutations on ty element retrotransposition and cdna recombination, termed ty mobility. the point mutations rad gs, rad gd, and rad ed that cause defects in certain enzymatic activities in vitro result in variable increases in ty mobility, ranging from to fold. the c terminal frameshift mutation rad confers the maximum increase in ty mobility ( fold), unincorporated cdna, and insertion at preferred target sites. the null mutation differs from the other rad alleles by increasing the frequency of multimeric ty insertions and cdna recombination with a genomic element. the rad mutants do not markedly alter the levels of ty rna or the tya gag protein. however, there is an increase in the stability of unincorporated ty cdna in rad and the null mutant. our results suggest that rad inhibits ty mobility by destabilizing unincorporated ty cdna and preventing the formation of ty multimers.
