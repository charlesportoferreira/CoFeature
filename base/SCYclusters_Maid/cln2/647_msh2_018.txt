the msh gene of schizosaccharomyces pombe is involved in mismatch repair, mating type switching, and meiotic chromosome organization.. . we have identified in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe a muts homolog that shows highest homology to the msh subgroup. msh disruption gives rise to increased mitotic mutation rates and increased levels of postmeiotic segregation of genetic markers. in bandshift assays performed with mshdelta cell extracts, a general mismatch binding activity is absent. by complementation assays, we showed that s. pombe msh is allelic with the previously identified swi and mut genes, which are involved in mating type switching. the swi mutant has a mutation in the msh gene which causes a truncated msh peptide lacking a putative dna binding domain. cytological analysis revealed that during meiotic prophase of msh defective cells, chromosomal structures were frequently formed; such structures are rarely found in the wild type. our data show that besides having a function in mismatch repair, s. pombe msh is required for correct termination of copy synthesis during mating type switching as well as for proper organization of chromosomes during meiosis.
