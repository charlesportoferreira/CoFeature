ty gag and pol genes encode the components of intracellular particles.. . ty is a saccharomyces cerevisiae retrotransposon that integrates near the transcription initiation sites of polymerase iii transcribed genes. it is distinct from the copialike ty and ty retrotransposons of s. cerevisiae in both the sequences of encoded proteins and gene order. it is a member of the gypsylike family of retrotransposons which resemble animal retroviruses. this study was undertaken to investigate the nucleocapsid particle of a transpositionally active gypsylike retrotransposon. characterization of extracts from cells in which ty expression was induced showed the presence of ty nucleoprotein complexes, or viruslike particles, that migrated on linear sucrose gradients with a size of s. these particles are composed of ty rna, full length, linear dna, and proteins. in this study, antibodies raised against peptides predicted from the ty sequence were used to identify ty encoded proteins. these include the capsid ( kda), nucleocapsid ( kda), and reverse transcriptase ( kda) proteins. ty integrase proteins of and kda were identified previously (l. j. hansen and s. b. sandmeyer, j. virol. . , ). reverse transcriptase activity associated with the particles was measured by using exogenous and endogenous primer templates. immunofluorescence studies of cells overexpressing ty revealed cytoplasmic clusters of immunoreactive proteins. transmission electron microscopy showed that ty viruslike particles are about nm in diameter. thus, despite the unusual position specificity of ty upstream of trna coding regions, aspects of the ty life cycle are fundamentally similar to those of retroviruses.
