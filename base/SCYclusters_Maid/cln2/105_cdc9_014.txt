the yeast rad and rad genes are required for postincision events during nucleotide excision repair. in vitro and in vivo studies with rad and rad mutants and purification of a rad/rad containing protein complex.. . in eukaryotes, nucleotide excision repair (ner) is a complex reaction requiring multiple proteins. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, two of these proteins, rad and rad, are specifically involved in the removal of lesions from transcriptionally silent regions of the genome in vivo. extracts prepared from rad or rad mutant cells are deficient, but not totally defective, in both oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis of damaged plasmid dna. we show that these extracts are, however, fully proficient in the incision step of the ner reaction in vitro. furthermore, using a cdc mutant to trap incision intermediates, we demonstrate that rad and rad mutants are proficient in ner dependent dna incision in vivo. a purified protein complex containing both rad and rad proteins complements the oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis defects in rad and rad mutant extracts. we conclude that the products of the rad and rad genes are involved in a postincision event(s) during ner in yeast.
