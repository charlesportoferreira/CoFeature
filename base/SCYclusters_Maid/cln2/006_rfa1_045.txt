the schizosaccharomyces pombe rad+ gene encodes the large subunit of replication protein a.. . replication protein a (rpa) is a heterotrimeric single stranded dna binding protein present in all eukaryotes. in vitro studies have implicated rpa in simian virus dna synthesis and nucleotide excision repair, but little direct information is available about the in vivo roles of the protein. we report here the cloning of the largest subunit of rpa (rpa+) from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe. the rpa+ gene is essential for viability and is expressed specifically at s phase of the cell cycle. genetic analysis revealed that rpa+ is the locus of the s. pombe radiation sensitive mutation rad. the rad allele exhibits pleiotropic effects consistent with an in vivo role for rpa in both dna repair and dna synthesis. the mutant is sensitive to both uv and ionizing radiation but is not defective in the dna damage dependent checkpoint, consistent with the hypothesis that rpa is part of the enzymatic machinery of dna repair. when incubated in hydroxyurea, rad cells initially arrest with a c dna content but then lose viability coincident with reentry into s phase, suggesting that dna synthesis is aberrant under these conditions. a significant fraction of the mutant cells subsequently undergo inappropriate mitosis in the presence of hydroxyurea, indicating that rpa also plays a role in the checkpoint mechanism that monitors the completion of s phase. we propose that rpa is required to maintain the integrity of replication complexes when dna replication is blocked. we further suggest that the rad mutation leads to the premature breakdown of such complexes, thereby preventing recovery from the hydroxyurea arrest and eliminating a signal recognized by the s phase checkpoint mechanism.
