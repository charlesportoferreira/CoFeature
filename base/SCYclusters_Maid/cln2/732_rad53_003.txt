atm related tel associates with double strand breaks through an xrs dependent mechanism.. . in budding yeast, tel encodes a protein closely related to atm. xrs is an nbs homolog and forms a complex with mre and rad. we show here that tel associates with double strand breaks (dsbs) through a mechanism dependent on the c terminus of xrs. although xrs is required for the dna degradation at dsbs, the c terminal xrs truncation does not affect the degradation. tel and the c terminus of xrs are similarly involved in cell survival and rad phosphorylation after dna damage. our findings suggest that the tel association with dna lesions is required for the activation of dna damage responses.
