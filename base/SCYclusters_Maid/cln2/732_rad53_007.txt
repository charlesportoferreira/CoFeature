robust g checkpoint arrest in budding yeast. dependence on dna damage signaling and repair.. . although most eukaryotes can arrest in g after ionizing radiation, the existence or significance of a g checkpoint in s. cerevisiae has been challenged. previous studies of g response to chemical mutagens, x ray or uv irradiation indicate that the delay before replication is transient and may reflect a strong intra s phase checkpoint. we examined the yeast response to double stranded breaks in g using gamma irradiation. g irradiation induces repair foci on chromosome spreads and a rad band shift characteristic of activation, which suggest an active dna damage response. consistent with a g arrest, bud emergence, spindle pole duplication and dna replication are each delayed in a dose dependent manner. sensitivity to mating pheromone is prolonged to over hours when g cells are lethally gamma or uv irradiated. strikingly, g delay is the predominant response to continuous gamma irradiation at a dose that confers no loss of viability but delays cell division. like the g/m checkpoint, g delay is completely dependent on both rad and rad epistasis groups but independent of pol(epsilon). lethally irradiated rad mutants rapidly exit g but perform a slow s phase, whereas rad and rad mutants are completely arrest deficient. distinct from gamma irradiation, g arrest after uv is rad dependent, suggesting that dna damage processing is required for checkpoint activation. therefore, as in the yeast g/m checkpoint response, free dna ends and/or single stranded dna are necessary and sufficient to induce a bona fide g checkpoint arrest.
