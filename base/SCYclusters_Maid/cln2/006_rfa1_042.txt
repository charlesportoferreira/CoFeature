saccharomyces ku, mre/rad and rpa proteins regulate adaptation to g/m arrest after dna damage.. . saccharomyces cells suffering a single unrepairable double strand break (dsb) exhibit a long, but transient arrest at g/m. hdf cells, lacking kup, fail to escape from this rad/rad dependent checkpoint. the effect of hdf results from its accelerated ' to ' degradation of the broken chromosome. permanent arrest in hdf cells is suppressed by rad or mre deletions that retard this degradation. wild type hdf cells also become permanently arrested when they experience two unrepairable dsbs. both dsb induced arrest conditions are suppressed by a mutation in the single strand binding protein, rpa. we suggest that escape from the dna damage induced g/m checkpoint depends on the extent of ssdna created at broken chromosome ends. rpa appears to play a key intermediate step in this adaptation.
