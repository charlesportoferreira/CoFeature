the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator, ncsp (rrdp), functions with clap to regulate the g()/m transition in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae p activated kinases, step and clap, have individual functions but appear to share an essential function(s) as well because a strain lacking both kinases is inviable. to learn more about the shared function, we sought new mutations that were lethal in the absence of cla. this approach led to the identification of at least complementation groups designated ncs (need cla to survive). as for ste cla mutants, most ncs cla double mutants were defective for septin localization during budding. one group, ncs/rrd (yilw), did not confer this defect, however, and we investigated its function further. ncsdelta cladelta cells arrested with elongated buds and short mitotic spindles. the morphological defects and lethality were suppressed by mutations that abrogate the cell cycle morphogenetic checkpoint, cdcyf or swedelta. the connection to the cell cycle may be direct, as we detected a clap cdcp complex. ncs encodes a protein with significant similarity to a mammalian phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator (ptpa) regulatory subunit for type a protein phosphatases (ppas). genetic and biochemical evidence suggested that the phosphatase sitp is a target for ncsp. first, cla and sit were synthetically lethal. second, ncsp and its yeast paralog, nohp (rrdp), bound to the catalytic domain of sitp in vitro, and ncsp could be immunoprecipitated with sitp but not with another ppa (pphp) from yeast cell extracts. strains lacking both ncs and noh were inviable and arrested as unbudded cells, implying that ptpa function is required for proper g() progression.
