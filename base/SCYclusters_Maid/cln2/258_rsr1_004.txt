a localized gtpase exchange factor, bud, determines the orientation of division axes in yeast.. . gtpases are widespread in directing cytoskeletal rearrangements and affecting cellular organization. how they do so is not well understood. yeast cells divide by budding, which occurs in two spatially programmed patterns, axial or bipolar [ ]. cytoskeletal polarization to form a bud is governed by the ras like gtpase, bud/rsr, in response to cortical landmarks. bud is uniformly distributed on the plasma membrane, so presumably its regulators, bud gtpase exchange factor and bud gtpase activating protein, impart spatial specificity to bud action []. we examined the localizations of bud and bud. both bud regulators associate with cortical landmarks designating former division sites. in haploids, bud forms double rings that encircle the mother bud neck and split upon cytokinesis so that each progeny cell inherits bud at the axial division remnant. recruitment of bud into these structures depends on known axial landmark components. in cells undergoing bipolar budding, bud associates with multiple sites, in response to the bipolar landmarks. like bud, bud associates with the axial division remnant, but rather than being inherited, bud transiently associates with the remnant in late g, before condensing into a patch at the incipient bud site. the relative timing of bud and bud localizations suggests that both regulators contribute to the spatially specific control of bud gtpase.
