the absence of ribonuclease h or h alters the sensitivity of saccharomyces cerevisiae to hydroxyurea, caffeine and ethyl methanesulphonate. implications for roles of rnases h in dna replication and repair.. . background. rna of rna dna hybrids can be degraded by ribonucleases h present in all organisms including the eukaryote saccharomyces cerevisiae. determination of the number and roles of the rnases h in eukaryotes is quite feasible in s. cerevisiae. results. two s. cerevisiae rnases h, related to escherichia coli rnase hi and hii, are not required for growth under normal conditions, yet, compared with wild type cells, a double deletion strain has an increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (hu) and is hypersensitive to caffeine and ethyl methanesulphonate (ems). in the absence of rnase h, rnase h activity increases, and cells are sensitive to ems but not hu and are more tolerant of caffeine; the latter requires rnase h activity. cells missing only rnase h exhibit increased sensitive to hu and ems but not caffeine conclusions. mutant phenotypes infer that some rna dna hybrids are recognized by both rnases h and h, while other hybrids appear to be recognized only by rnase h. undegraded rna dna hybrids have an effect when dna synthesis is impaired, dna damage occurs or the cell cycle is perturbed by exposure to caffeine suggesting a role in dna replication/repair that can be either beneficial or detrimental to cell viability.
