selection by genetic transformation of a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant defective for the nuclear uracil dna glycosylase.. . a coliphage m chimer containing the saccharomyces cerevisiae trp gene and ars replication origin (mpy) was grown on an ung dut strain of escherichia coli. the resulting single stranded phage dna had % of thymine residues substituted by uracil. this dna failed to transform a delta trp yeast strain to prototrophy. however, when a mutagenized yeast stock was transformed with uracil containing single stranded mpy dna, unstable transformants were obtained. after plasmid segregation, about half of these were retransformed at a high frequency by uracil containing single stranded mpy dna. in vitro, these mutants were defective for uracil dna glycosylase activity. they were designated ung. strains containing the ung mutation have an increased sensitivity to sodium bisulfite and sodium nitrite but a wild type sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate, uv light, and drugs that cause depletion of the thymidylate pool. they have a moderate mutator phenotype for nuclear but not for mitochondrial genes. a low mitochondrial uracil dna glycosylase activity was demonstrated in the mutant strains.
