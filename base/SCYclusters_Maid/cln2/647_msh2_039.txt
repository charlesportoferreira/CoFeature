mutation in the dna mismatch repair gene homologue hmlh is associated with hereditary non polyposis colon cancer.. . the human dna mismatch repair gene homologue hmsh, on chromosome p is involved in hereditary non polyposis colon cancer (hnpcc). on the basis of linkage data, a second hnpcc locus was assigned to chromosome p (ref. ). here we report that a human gene encoding a protein, hmlh (human mutl homologue), homologous to the bacterial dna mismatch repair protein mutl, is located on human chromosome p. . we propose that hmlh is the hnpcc gene located on p because of the similarity of the hmlh gene product to the yeast dna mismatch repair protein, mlh, the coincident location of the hmlh gene and the hnpcc locus on chromosome , and hmlh missense mutations in affected individuals from a chromosome linked hnpcc family.
