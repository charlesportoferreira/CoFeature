the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad gene, a homologue of escherichia coli dinb and umuc, is dna damage inducible and functions in a novel error free postreplication repair mechanism.. . damage inducible mutagenesis in prokaryotes is largely dependent upon the activity of the umud'c like proteins. since many dna repair processes are structurally and/or functionally conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, we investigated the role of rad, a previously uncharacterized saccharomyces cerevisiae dna repair gene related to the escherichia coli dinb, umuc and s. cerevisiae rev genes, in uv resistance and uv induced mutagenesis. similar to its prokaryotic homologues, rad was found to be damage inducible. like many s. cerevisiae genes involved in error prone dna repair, epistasis analysis clearly places rad in the rad group and rad mutants display moderate uv sensitivity reminiscent of rev mutants. however, unlike rev mutants, no defect in uv induced reversion was seen in rad strains. while rad and rad are both epistatic to rad, no epistasis was observed with rev, rev, rev or rad, all of which are members of the rad epistasis group. these findings suggest that rd participates in a novel error free repair pathway dependent on rad and rad, but independent of rev, rev, rev and rad.
