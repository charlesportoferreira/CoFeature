expansion and length dependent fragility of ctg repeats in yeast.. . expansion of dna trinucleotide repeats (tnrs) is the causative mutation in a growing number of human genetic diseases. large expansions of a ctg tract were obtained and shown by genetic and physical assays to be length dependent sites of chromosome breakage in saccharomyces cerevisiae. deletion of rad, which encodes a nuclease involved in okazaki fragment processing, caused length dependent destabilization of ctg tracts and a substantial increase in expansion frequency. the genetic assay described here can be used to evaluate other factors that induce tnr expansion or chromosome fragility in humans.
