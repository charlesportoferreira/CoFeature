conditional lethality of null mutations in rth that encodes the yeast counterpart of a mammalian ' to ' exonuclease required for lagging strand dna synthesis in reconstituted systems.. . a ' to ' exonuclease of about kda has been purified from various mammalian sources and shown to be required for the completion of lagging strand synthesis in reconstituted dna replication systems. rth encodes the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae counterpart of the mammalian enzyme. to determine the in vivo biological role of rth encoded ' to ' exonuclease, we have examined the effects of an rth delta mutation on various cellular processes. rth delta mutants grow poorly at degrees c, and a cessation in growth occurs upon transfer of the mutant to degrees c. at the restrictive temperature, the rth delta mutant exhibits a terminal cell cycle morphology similar to that of mutants defective in dna replication, and levels of spontaneous mitotic recombination are elevated in the rth delta mutant even at the permissive temperature. the rth delta mutation does not affect uv or gamma ray sensitivity but enhances sensitivity to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. the role of rth in dna replication and in repair of alkylation damage is discussed.
