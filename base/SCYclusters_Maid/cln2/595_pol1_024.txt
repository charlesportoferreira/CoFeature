nucleotide sequence and characterization of temperature sensitive pol mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have analyzed the effects of temperature sensitivity (ts) conferring mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae dna polymerase i encoding gene on cell growth, in vivo dna synthesis, intrachromosomal gene conversion and pop out recombination. also, we have identified the molecular defect responsible for the ts phenotype. two mutant alleles (cdc , cdc ) were originally identified as cell cycle mutations, while a third mutation (hpr) was found during a genetic screening for mutants with a hyper recombination phenotype. both cdc and hpr cells complete one round of cell division and dna replication after shift to nonpermissive temperature, before being arrested as dumbbell shaped cells. conversely, the cdc mutation immediately blocks growth and dna synthesis at degrees c. no substantial difference was observed in the frequency of intrachromosomal gene conversion and pop out recombination events, when hpr and cdc were compared to the previously characterized pol mutant. these two frequencies were ten to fold above wild type level at semipermissive temperature. in each mutant, a single bp substitution, causing the replacement of gly residues by either asp (cdc , cdc ) or glu (hpr) in yeast dna polymerase i is responsible for the ts phenotype.
