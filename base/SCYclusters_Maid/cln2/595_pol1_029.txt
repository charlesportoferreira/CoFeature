temperature sensitive mutations in the yeast dna polymerase i gene.. . seven mutations that yield thermolabile dna polymerases have been isolated in the dna polymerase i gene, pol, of saccharomyces cerevisiae. strains carrying the mutant genes are temperature sensitive for growth. the pol mutants were identified by a method that has general applicability for identification of both temperature sensitive and null mutations. a plasmid containing a mutagenized pol gene was transformed into a strain in which the only functional copy of the pol gene was carried on an unstable plasmid. the genes conferring temperature sensitive growth were detected after elimination of the unstable plasmid containing the wild type gene. dna polymerase i isolated from each of the mutants is defective at both degrees c and degrees c. dna synthesis is deficient in vivo at degrees c in all the mutants, while rna synthesis is normal in all but one of the mutants. the terminal phenotype of pol temperature sensitive mutants is dumbbell shaped cells in which the nucleus has migrated to, but apparently not entered, the isthmus separating the mother and the daughter. the pol gene is located on chromosome xiv approximately centimorgans away from met.
