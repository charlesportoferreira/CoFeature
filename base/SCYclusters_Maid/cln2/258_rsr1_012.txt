genetic evidence for the roles of the bud site selection genes bud and bud in control of the rsrp (budp) gtpase in yeast.. . yeast cells normally display either an axial (for mata or mat alpha cells) or bipolar (for mata/alpha cells) pattern of bud site selection. the rsr gene, which was previously identified as a multicopy suppressor of ts mutations in the bud emergence gene cdc, encodes a gtpase of the ras family that is required for both budding patterns. mutations in rsrp that presumably block its ability to bind or hydrolyze gtp cause a randomized budding phenotype, suggesting that regulators of rsrp will prove to be required for proper bud positioning. the bud gene product is required for proper bud site selection and contains similarity to gdp dissociation stimulators (gds) for ras type proteins, suggesting that budp may be a gds for rsrp. here i report that bud is required for wild type rsr, but not for mutationally activated rsrval, to serve as a multicopy suppressor of cdc, indicating that budp functions as a gds for rsrp in vivo. to identify the gap (gtpase activating protein) for rsrp, a genetic selection was designed based on the observation that mutationally activated rsrval, but not wild type rsr, can serve as a multicopy suppressor of yeast ras(ts) mutants. mutants were selected that allowed wild type rsr to act as a multicopy suppressor of ras(ts). two such mutations proved to be in the bud gene, suggesting that budp functions as a gap for rsrp in vivo.
