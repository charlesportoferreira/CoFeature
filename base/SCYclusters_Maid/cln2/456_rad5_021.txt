meiotic recombination and sporulation in repair deficient strains of yeast.. . a genetic system designed to monitor recombination and sporulation in various repair deficient yeast strains was constructed. variously heterozygous at seven or eight sites distributed across the genome, the system facilitated sensitive detection of changes in frequency or pattern of meiotic recombination. ten rad mutants sensitive primarily to uv irradiation and without terminal blocks in the sporulation process were studied. seven were defective in excision repair (rad, rad, rad, rad, rad, rad and rad), and three were defective in mutagenic repair (rad, rad and rad). individually, each mutant displayed behavior consistent with an orthodox meiosis including a wild type meiotic recombination profile with respect to gene conversion, pms and intergenic map distances. accordingly, we conclude that these mutants are without major effect on meiotic heteroduplex formation or correction. however, certain combinations of excision defective mutants with rad exhibited marked ascosporal inviability. tetraploids homozygous for rad and rad produce a large proportion of diploid spores containing a recessive lethal.
