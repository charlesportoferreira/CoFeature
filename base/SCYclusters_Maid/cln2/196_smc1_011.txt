smc. an essential yeast gene encoding a putative head rod tail protein is required for nuclear division and defines a new ubiquitous protein family.. . the smc mutant was identified initially as a mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae that had an elevated rate of minichromosome nondisjunction. we have cloned the wild type smc gene. the sequence of the smc gene predicts that its product (smcp) is a kd protein, and antibodies against smc protein detect a protein with mobility of kd. analysis of the primary and putative secondary structure of smcp suggests that it contains two central coiled coil regions flanked by an amino terminal nucleoside triphosphate (ntp) binding head and a conserved carboxy terminal tail. these analyses also indicate that smcp is an evolutionary conserved protein and is a member of a new family of proteins ubiquitous among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. the smc gene is essential for viability. several phenotypic characteristics of the mutant alleles of smc gene indicate that its product is involved in some aspects of nuclear metabolism, most likely in chromosome segregation. the smc and smc mutants have a dramatic increase in mitotic loss of a chromosome fragment and chromosome iii, respectively, but have no increase in mitotic recombination. depletion of smc function in the ts mutant, smc , causes a dramatic mitosis related lethality. smcp depleted cells have a defect in nuclear division as evidenced by the absence of anaphase cells. this phenotype of the smc mutant is not rad dependent. based upon the facts that smcp is a member of a ubiquitous family, and it is essential for yeast nuclear division, we propose that smcp and smcp like proteins function in a fundamental aspect of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell division.
