physical interaction between components of dna mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair.. . nucleotide excision repair (ner) and dna mismatch repair are required for some common processes although the biochemical basis for this requirement is unknown. saccharomyces cerevisiae rad was identified in a two hybrid screen using msh as &quot;bait,&quot; and pairwise interactions between msh and rad, rad, rad, rad, rad, and rad subsequently were demonstrated by two hybrid analysis. msh coimmunoprecipitated specifically with epitope tagged versions of rad, rad, rad, and rad. msh and rad were found to interact in msh msh and mlh pms double mutants, suggesting a direct interaction with msh. mutations in msh increased the uv sensitivity of ner deficient yeast strains, and msh mutations were epistatic to the mutator phenotype observed in ner deficient strains. these data suggest that msh and possibly other components of dna mismatch repair exist in a complex with ner proteins, providing a biochemical and genetical basis for these proteins to function in common processes.
