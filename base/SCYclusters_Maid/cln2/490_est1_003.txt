telomerase. what are the est proteins doing?. . saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a useful model organism for the study of telomerase, a specialized cellular reverse transcriptase that helps maintain genomic stability by adding telomeric dna repeats to the ends of chromosomes. yeast telomerase is thought to be a holoenzyme containing estp and tlc rna, the catalytic subunit and its intrinsic template, respectively, as well as the tlc rna associated factors estp and estp. cdcp, a sequence specific telomere dna binding protein, is also required for action in vivo. a current model for telomerase regulation is that telomere associated cdcp binds estp, thereby recruiting telomerase. however, recent chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest an alternate role for estp in activating estp tlc rna that is already bound to the telomere. three models for estp activation are presented.
