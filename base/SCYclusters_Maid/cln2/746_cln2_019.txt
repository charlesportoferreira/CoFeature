ubiquitination of the g cyclin clnp by a cdcp dependent pathway.. . recombinant g cyclin clnp can bind to and stimulate the protein kinase activity of pcdc (cdcp) in an extract derived from cyclin depleted and g arrested saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. upon activating cdcp, clnp is extensively phosphorylated and conjugated with multiubiquitin chains. ubiquitination of clnp in vitro requires the cdcp ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, cdcp, protein phosphorylation and unidentified factors in yeast extract. ubiquitination of clnp by cdcp contributes to the instability of clnp in vivo, as the rate of clnp degradation is reduced in cdcts cells. these results provide a molecular framework for g cyclin instability and suggest that a multicomponent, regulated pathway specifies the selective ubiquitination of g cyclins.
