an altered nuclear migration into the daughter bud is induced by the cyclin a mediated cdc kinase through an aberrant spindle movement in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains an integrated copy of a xenopus cyclin a gene under the control of the gal promoter has been constructed. on inducing expression of cyclin a, the nuclear migration that occurs prior to division becomes aberrant. instead of migrating to the neck between the mother cell and daughter bud, the nucleus, the short mitotic spindle and its associated two spindle pole bodies entered the daughter bud. this phenotype was induced by expression of an indestructible cyclin mutant, but not by a mutated cyclin a unable to activate cdc kinase. the nuclear abnormality induced by cyclin a was overcome by cdc mutations that abolish its ability to bind cyclin a. both yeast cyclin clb and xenopus mitotic cyclin b produced the same phenotype, whereas g cyclin cln did not. the results suggest that the proper movement of the nucleus through the spindle function during mitosis requires the appropriate activity of cdc kinase mediated by specific cyclins.
