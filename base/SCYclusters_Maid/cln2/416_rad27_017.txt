novel function of rad (fen ) in restricting short sequence recombination.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants lacking the structure specific nuclease rad display an enhancement in recombination that increases as sequence length decreases, suggesting that rad preferentially restricts recombination between short sequences. since wild type alleles of both rad and its human homologue fen complement the elevated short sequence recombination (ssr) phenotype of a rad null mutant, this function may be conserved from yeast to humans. furthermore, mutant rad and fen enzymes with partial flap endonuclease activity but without nick specific exonuclease activity partially complement the ssr phenotype of the rad null mutant. this suggests that the endonuclease activity of rad (fen ) plays a role in limiting recombination between short sequences in eukaryotic cells.
