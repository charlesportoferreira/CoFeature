mapping of early firing origins on a replication profile of budding yeast.. . background. understanding of the firing time determination of replication origins in the entire genome will require a genome wide survey of replication origins and their mapping on chromosomes. a microarray technology was applied to obtain a genome wide profile of dna replication and to classify early firing origins. results. a total of potential replication origins (pros) were identified in the entire budding yeast genome. as defined peaks on the replication profile and as regions located in the chromosomal termini. based on the firing time, the pros were classified into early pros and late pros, that were not randomly distributed on chromosomes but formed separated clusters. most of the early pros were found to fire in the presence of hydroxyurea, indicating that they were free from the control of the intra s checkpoint mediated by mec and rad. conclusions. the monitoring method of dna replication and the analysis method of microarray data used in this study proved powerful for obtaining a genome wide view of the initiation and progression of dna replication.
