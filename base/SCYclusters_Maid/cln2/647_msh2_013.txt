candidate mutator genes in mismatch repair deficient thymic lymphomas. no evidence of mutations in the dna polymerase delta gene.. . dna mismatch repair (mmr) proteins recognize nucleotides that are incorrectly paired. deficiencies in mmr lead to increased genomic instability reflected in an increased mutation frequency and predisposition to tumorigenesis. mice lacking the mmr gene, msh, develop thymic lymphomas that exhibit much higher mutational frequencies than other msh( / ) tumours and msh( / ) normal thymic tissue, suggesting that an additional mutator may have been acquired in a tissue specific manner. clustered mutations observed exclusively in the thymic lymphomas suggests that a gene(s) associated with the replication machinery might have become altered during tumorigenesis. based on mutation studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking msh and dna polymerase delta (dna pol delta), we hypothesized that the acquisition of mutations in dna pol delta could contribute to the hypermutator phenotype and tumorigenesis in msh( / ) thymic tissue. furthermore, previous reports have suggested that genes containing mononucleotide repeats are non random mutational targets in the absence of mmr. therefore, we sequenced all exons of the dna pol delta catalytic subunit, including the six exons containing mononucleotide repeats of &gt; bp, from nine msh( / ) thymic lymphomas and two wild type controls. no dna pol delta pathogenic mutations were found in the thymic lymphomas, although several dna base differences compared with published dna pol delta sequences were observed. we conclude, therefore, that inactivating mutations in dna pol delta are not a contributing factor in the development of the hypermutator phenotype in mmr deficient murine thymic lymphomas.
