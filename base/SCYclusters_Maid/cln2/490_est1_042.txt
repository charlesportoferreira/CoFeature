an alternative pathway for yeast telomere maintenance rescues est senescence.. . yeast cells lacking a functional est gene show progressive shortening of the terminal g t telomeric repeats and a parallel increase in the frequency of cell death. although the majority of the cells in an est culture die, a minor subpopulation survives the potentially lethal consequences of the est mutation. we show that these est survivors arise as a result of the amplification and acquisition of subtelomeric elements (and their deletion derivatives) by a large number of telomeres. hence, even when the primary pathway for telomere replication is defective, an alternative backup pathway can restore telomere function and keep the cell alive.
