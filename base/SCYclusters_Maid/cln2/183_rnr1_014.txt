the role of ' ' exonucleolytic proofreading and mismatch repair in yeast mitochondrial dna error avoidance.. . in the dg/da mutant generated at conserved aspartate residues in the exo and exo sites of the ' ' exonuclease domain of the yeast mitochondrial dna (mtdna) polymerase (pol gamma), the mitochondrial genome is unstable and the frequency of mtdna point mutations is times higher than in the wild type strain and times higher than in single substitution mutants. the () fold decrease in the ' ' exonuclease activity of the purified mtdna polymerase is associated with mismatch extension and high rates of base misincorporation. processivity of the purified polymerase on primed single stranded dna is decreased and the km for dntp is increased. the sequencing of mtdna point mutations in the wild type strain and in proofreading and mismatch repair deficient mutants shows that mismatch repair contributes to elimination of the transitions while exonucleolytic proofreading preferentially repairs transversions, and more specifically a to t (or t to a) transversions. however, even in the wild type strain, a to t (or t to a) transversions are the most frequent substitutions, suggesting that they are imperfectly repaired. the combination of both mismatch repair and proofreading deficiencies elicits a mitochondrial error catastrophe. these data show that the faithful replication of yeast mtdna requires both exonucleolytic proofreading and mismatch repair.
