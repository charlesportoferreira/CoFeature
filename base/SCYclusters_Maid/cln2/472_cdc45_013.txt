dna synthesis at individual replication forks requires the essential initiation factor cdcp.. . cdcp assembles at replication origins before initia tion and is required for origin firing in saccharomyces cerevisiae. a heat inducible cdc degron mutant was constructed that promotes rapid degradation of cdcp at the restrictive temperature. consistent with a role in initiation, loss of cdcp in g() prevents all detectable dna replication without preventing subsequent entry into mitosis. loss of cdcp activity during s phase blocks s phase completion but not activation of replication checkpoints. using density substitution, we show that after allowing replication fork establishment, cdcp inactivation prevents the subsequent progression of individual replication forks. this provides the first direct functional evidence that cdcp plays an essential role during elongation. thus, like the large t antigen in sv replication, cdcp plays a central role in both initiation and elongation phases of chromosomal dna replication.
