replication protein a is sequentially phosphorylated during meiosis.. . phosphorylation of the cellular single stranded dna binding protein, replication protein a (rpa), occurs during normal mitotic cell cycle progression and also in response to genotoxic stress. in budding yeast, these reactions require the atm homolog mec, a central regulator of the dna replication and dna damage checkpoint responses. we now demonstrate that the middle subunit of yeast rpa (rfa) becomes phosphorylated in two discrete steps during meiosis. primary rfa phosphorylation occurs early in meiotic progression and is independent of dna replication, recombination and mec. in contrast, secondary rfa phosphorylation is activated upon initiation of recombination and requires mec. while the primary rfa phosphoisomer is detectable throughout most of meiosis, the secondary rfa phosphoisomer is only transiently generated and begins to disappear soon after recombination is complete. extensive secondary rfa phosphorylation is observed in a recombination mutant defective for the pachytene checkpoint, indicating that mec dependent rfa phosphorylation does not function to maintain meiotic delay in response to dna double strand breaks. our results suggest that mec dependent rpa phosphorylation could be involved in regulating recombination rather than cell cycle or meiotic progression.
