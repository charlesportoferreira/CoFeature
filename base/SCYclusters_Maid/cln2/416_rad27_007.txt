differential processing of leading and lagging strand ends at saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres revealed by the absence of radp nuclease.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking the radp nuclease, a homolog of the mammalian fen protein, display an accumulation of extensive single stranded g tails at telomeres. furthermore, the lengths of telomeric repeats become very heterogeneous. these phenotypes could be the result of aberrant okazaki fragment processing of the c rich strand, elongation of the g rich strand by telomerase, or an abnormally high activity of the nucleolytic activities required to process leading strand ends. to distinguish among these possibilities, we analyzed strains carrying a deletion of the rad gene and also lacking genes required for in vivo telomerase activity. the results show that double mutant strains died more rapidly than strains lacking only telomerase components. furthermore, in such strains there is a significant reduction in the signals for g tails as compared to those detected in raddelta cells. the results from studies of the replication intermediates of a linear plasmid in raddelta cells are consistent with the idea that only one end of the plasmid acquires extensive g tails, presumably the end made by lagging strand synthesis. these data further support the notion that chromosome ends have differential requirements for end processing, depending on whether the ends were replicated by leading or lagging strand synthesis.
