dominant mutations in three different subunits of replication factor c suppress replication defects in yeast pcna mutants.. . to identify proteins that interact with the yeast proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), we used a genetic approach to isolate mutations that compensate for the defects in cold sensitive (cs( )) mutants of yeast pcna (pol). because the cocrystal structure of human pcna and a p(waf/cip) peptide shows that the interdomain region of pcna is a site of p interaction, we specifically looked for new mutations that suppress mutations in the equivalent region of yeast pcna. in independent screens using three different cs( ) mutants, we identified spontaneously arising dominant suppressor mutations in the rfc gene. in addition, dominant suppressor mutations were identified in the rfc and rfc genes using a single pol mutant. an intimate association between pcna and rfcp, rfcp, and rfcp is suggested by the allele restricted suppression of different pol alleles by the rfc suppressors. rfc, rfc, and rfc encode three of the five subunits of the replication factor c complex, which is required to load pcna onto dna in reconstituted dna replication reactions. genomic sequencing reveals a common region in rfcp, rfcp, and rfcp that is important for the functional interaction with pcna. biochemical analysis of the wild type and mutant pcna and rfc proteins shows that mutant rfcp enhances the production of long dna products in pol delta dependent dna synthesis, which is consistent with an increase in processivity.
