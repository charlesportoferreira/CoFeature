defects in mismatch repair promote telomerase independent proliferation.. . mismatch repair has a central role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing dna replication errors and inhibiting recombination between non identical (homeologous) sequences. defects in mismatch repair have been linked to certain human cancers, including hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) and sporadic tumours. a crucial requirement for tumour cell proliferation is the maintenance of telomere length, and most tumours achieve this by reactivating telomerase. in both yeast and human cells, however, telomerase independent telomere maintenance can occur as a result of recombination dependent exchanges between often imperfectly matched telomeric sequences. here we show that loss of mismatch repair function promotes cellular proliferation in the absence of telomerase. defects in mismatch repair, including mutations that correspond to the same amino acid changes recovered from hnpcc tumours, enhance telomerase independent survival in both saccharomyces cerevisiae and a related budding yeast with a degree of telomere sequence homology that is similar to human telomeres. these results indicate that enhanced telomeric recombination in human cells with mismatch repair defects may contribute to cell immortalization and hence tumorigenesis.
