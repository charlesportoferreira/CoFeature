human cdc protein binds to minichromosome maintenance protein and the p subunit of dna polymerase alpha.. . budding yeast cdc encodes cdcp, an essential protein required to trigger initiation of dna replication in late g phase. we cloned four and one species of the human cdcp homolog cdna, resulting from different splicing patterns, from hela cell and human placenta cdna libraries, respectively. a comparison of the cdnas and the genomic sequence showed that the longest encoding a amino acid protein was comprised of exons. one species, which lacks exon and contains the shorter of two exons , was identical with the previously reported cdcl cdna and constituted out of clones from hela cells. splicing was different in hela cells and tig cells, a human diploid cell line. human cdc protein was found to bind directly in vitro to human minichromosome maintenance protein (hmcm) and to the p subunit of dna polymerase alpha. the data support a thesis that human cdc acts as a molecular tether to mediate loading of the dna polymerase alpha on to the dna replication complex through binding to hmcm.
