bacteriophage t rnh (rnase h) null mutations. effects on spontaneous mutation and epistatic interaction with rii mutations.. . the bacteriophage t rnh gene encodes t rnase h, a relative of a family of flap endonucleases. t rnh null mutations reduce burst sizes, increase sensitivity to dna damage, and increase the frequency of acriflavin resistance (acr) mutations. because mutations in the related saccharomyces cerevisiae rad gene display a remarkable duplication mutator phenotype, we further explored the impact of rnh mutations upon the mutation process. we observed that most acr mutants in an rnh+ strain contain ac mutations, whereas only roughly half of the acr mutants detected in an rnhdelta strain bear ac mutations. in contrast to the mutational specificity displayed by most mutators, the dna alterations of ac mutations arising in rnhdelta and rnh+ backgrounds are indistinguishable. thus, the increase in acr mutants in an rnhdelta background is probably not due to a mutator effect. this conclusion is supported by the lack of increase in the frequency of ri mutations in an rnhdelta background. in a screen that detects mutations at both the ri locus and the much larger rii locus, the r frequency was severalfold lower in an rnhdelta background. this decrease was due to the phenotype of rnh rii double mutants, which display an r+ plaque morphology but retain the characteristic inability of rii mutants to grow on lambda lysogens. finally, we summarize those aspects of t forward mutation systems which are relevant to optimal choices for investigating quantitative and qualitative aspects of the mutation process.
