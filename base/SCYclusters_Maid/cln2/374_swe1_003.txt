the rho gap bemp plays a gap independent role in the morphogenesis checkpoint.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae morphogenesis checkpoint delays mitosis in response to insults that impair actin organization and/or bud formation. the delay is due to accumulation of the inhibitory kinase swep, which phosphorylates the cyclin dependent kinase cdcp. having screened through a panel of yeast mutants with defects in cell morphogenesis, we report here that the polarity establishment protein bemp is required for the checkpoint response. bemp is a rho gtpase activating protein (gap) previously shown to act on rhop, and we now show that it also acts on cdcp, the gtpase primarily responsible for establishment of cell polarity in yeast. whereas the morphogenesis role of bemp required gap activity, the checkpoint role of bemp did not. instead, this function required an n terminal bemp domain. thus, this single protein has a gap dependent role in promoting cell polarity and a gap independent role in responding to defects in cell polarity by enacting the checkpoint. surprisingly, swep accumulation occurred normally in bem cells, but they were nevertheless unable to promote cdcp phosphorylation. therefore, bemp defines a novel pathway in the morphogenesis checkpoint.
