incision and postincision steps of pyrimidine dimer removal in excision defective mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . cdc, a temperature sensitive mutant defective in polynucleotide deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) ligase activity, accumulates low molecular weight dna fragments (as measured by sedimentation of dna in alkaline sucrose gradients) at the nonpermissive temperature after irradiation with ultraviolet light. this phenotype of cdc is a sensitive indicator of successful incision during excision repair of dimers. in strains containing excision defective mutations in any of nine genes in combination with the cdc mutation, the absence of low molecular weight dna at the nonpermissive temperature after ultraviolet treatment suggests that these mutants are incision defective, whereas the presence of low molecular weight dna indicates that the mutants are defective in a step after incision. with rad, rad, rad, rad, and rad mutants, the molecular weight of the dna remained unchanged after ultraviolet irradiation and incubation at the restrictive temperature, despite the presence of the cdc mutation; these mutants are therefore incision defective. low molecular weight dna was observed in rad cdc and rad cdc strains. with the rad strain, the accumulation of low molecular weight dna correlated with the amount of excision taking place, whereas in the rad mutant strain, no evidence of dimer removal was obtained. therefore, rad is likely to be defective in a step after incision.
