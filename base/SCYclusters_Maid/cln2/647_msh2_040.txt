characterization of a dna mismatch binding activity in yeast extracts.. . an activity present in nuclear extracts of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae binds specifically to oligonucleotides containing dna mismatches, as judged by a band shift assay. the specificity of this activity for mismatched dna was confirmed by competition experiments; binding to radiolabeled heteroduplexes was abolished in the presence of excess unlabeled heteroduplex but not when excess unlabeled homoduplex was added. both t/g and t/ (single base deletion) mispairs were recognized in each of two sequence contexts. binding was also observed with g/g, g/a, a/c, and t/c mismatches, but recognition of a c/c mispair was very weak. competition studies with the various mismatches were consistent with the idea that a single activity recognizes all mispairs tested. extracts from strains mutant in either or both of two putative mismatch recognition functions, msh and msh, were also tested. mismatch binding activity was present in extracts of msh strains but completely absent in msh strains. the molecular weight of the major binding protein was estimated by uv cross linking experiments to be approximately kda, in good agreement with the size predicted for msh protein (reenan, r. a. and kolodner, r. d.
