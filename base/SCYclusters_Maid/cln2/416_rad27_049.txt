evolutionary conservation of excision repair in schizosaccharomyces pombe. evidence for a family of sequences related to the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad gene.. . cells mutated at the rad locus in the fission yeast, schizosaccharomyces pombe are deficient in excision repair of uv damage. we have cloned the s.pombe rad gene by its ability to complement the uv sensitivity of a rad mutant. the gene is not essential for cell proliferation. sequence analysis of the cloned gene revealed an open reading frame of amino acids with structural homology to the rad gene of the distantly related saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sequence similarity is confined to three domains, two close to the n terminus of the encoded protein, the third being close to the c terminus. the central region of about amino acids shows little similarity between the two organisms. the first and third domains are also found in a related yet distinct pair of homologous s.pombe/s.cerevisiae dna repair genes (rad/ykl), which have only a very short region between these two conserved domains. using the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate primers, we have isolated fragments from a gene homologous to rad/rad from aspergillus nidulans. these findings define new functional domains involved in excision repair, as well as identifying a conserved family of genes related to rad.
