mph, a yeast gene encoding a deah protein, plays a role in protection of the genome from spontaneous and chemically induced damage.. . we have characterized the mph gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae. mph mutants display a spontaneous mutator phenotype. homologs were found in archaea and in the est libraries of drosophila, mouse, and man. mph carries the signature motifs of the deah family of helicases. selected motifs were shown to be necessary for mph function by introducing missense mutations. possible indirect effects on translation and splicing were excluded by demonstrating nuclear localization of the protein and splicing proficiency of the mutant. a mutation spectrum did not show any conspicuous deviations from wild type except for an underrepresentation of frameshift mutations. the mutator phenotype was dependent on rev and rad. the mutant was sensitive to mms, ems, nqo, and camptothecin, but not to uv light and x rays. epistasis analyses were carried out with representative mutants from various repair pathways (msh, mag, apn, rad, rad, rad, mms, and rev). no epistatic interactions were found, either for the spontaneous mutator phenotype or for mms, ems, and nqo sensitivity. mph slightly increased the uv sensitivity of mms, rad, and rad mutants, but no effect on x ray sensitivity was observed. these data suggest that mph is not part of a hitherto known repair pathway. possible functions are discussed.
