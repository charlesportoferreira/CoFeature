heterozygous germ line hchk mutations in li fraumeni syndrome.. . the hchk gene encodes the human homolog of the yeast cds and rad g checkpoint kinases, whose activation in response to dna damage prevents cellular entry into mitosis. here, it is shown that heterozygous germ line mutations in hchk occur in li fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype usually associated with inherited mutations in the tp gene. these observations suggest that hchk is a tumor suppressor gene conferring predisposition to sarcoma, breast cancer, and brain tumors, and they also provide a link between the central role of p inactivation in human cancer and the well defined g checkpoint in yeast.
