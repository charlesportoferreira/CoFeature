bimodal interaction between replication protein a and dna is critical for dna function both in vivo and in vitro.. . we have previously shown that replication protein a (rpa), the heterotrimeric single stranded dna binding protein of eukaryotes, plays a role in okazaki fragment processing by acting as a molecular switch between the two endonucleases, dna and fen, to ensure the complete removal of primer rnas in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the stimulation of dna endonuclease activity by rpa requires direct protein protein interaction. in this report we have analyzed genetically and biochemically the interaction of dna with rpa. rfa, the gene encoding the large subunit of rpa, displayed allele specific interactions with dna that included synthetic lethality and intergenic complementation. in addition, we identified physical and functional interactions between these proteins and found that rpa binds dna predominantly through its large subunit, rpa. consistent with the mapping of synthetic lethal mutations, robust interaction localizes to the c termini of these proteins. moreover, the n terminal domains of dna and rpa appear to be important for a functional interaction because the n terminal domain of rpa was required to maximally stimulate dna endonuclease activity. we propose that a bimodal interaction of dna with rpa is important for dna function both in vivo and in vitro. the relevance of each interaction with respect to the function of the dna endonuclease activity is discussed.
