phosphorylation dependent ubiquitination of cyclin e by the scffbw ubiquitin ligase.. . cyclin e binds and activates the cyclin dependent kinase cdk and catalyzes the transition from the g phase to the s phase of the cell cycle. the amount of cyclin e protein present in the cell is tightly controlled by ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. here we identify the ubiquitin ligase responsible for cyclin e ubiquitination as scffbw and demonstrate that it is functionally conserved in yeast, flies, and mammals. fbw associates specifically with phosphorylated cyclin e, and scffbw catalyzes cyclin e ubiquitination in vitro. depletion of fbw leads to accumulation and stabilization of cyclin e in vivo in human and drosophila melanogaster cells. multiple f box proteins contribute to cyclin e stability in yeast, suggesting an overlap in scf e ligase specificity that allows combinatorial control of cyclin e degradation.
