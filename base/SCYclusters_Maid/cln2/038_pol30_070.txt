degradation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen by s proteasome in rice (oryza sativa l.).. . to study whether metabolic control of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) during the cell cycle is similar to that of associated protein factors, two hybrid analysis with pcna from rice (oryza sativa l. cv. nipponbare) was performed. pcna interacted with rice rpt, which is the atpase subunit of s proteasome, both in vitro and in vivo, and the degradation of pcna was disrupted by the proteasome in vivo. the tissue specific expression pattern of the transcripts of rpt and pcna suggested that the rice proteasome played important roles in dna replication involving pcna. these findings indicate a proteasome dependent degradation of pcna.
