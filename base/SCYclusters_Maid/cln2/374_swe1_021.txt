cdc and the f box protein met are required for degradation of the cdk inhibitory kinase swe.. . ubiquitin mediated proteolysis controls the abundance of many cell cycle regulatory proteins. recent work in saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that a complex consisting of cdc, skp, and a third component known as an f box protein (termed scf) in combination with cdc specifically targets regulatory proteins for degradation, and that substrate specificity is likely to be mediated by the f box subunit. a screen for genetic interactions with a cdc mutation yielded met, which encodes an f box protein. met is an essential gene required for cell cycle progression and met mutations interact genetically with mutations in scf components. furthermore, physical interactions between met, cdc, cdc, and skp in vivo provide evidence for an scfmet complex. we demonstrate the involvement of met in the degradation of the cdk inhibitory kinase swe. swe is stabilized in met mutants and gst met pull down experiments reveal that met specifically binds swe in vivo. furthermore, extracts prepared from cdc or met mutants are defective in polyubiquitination of swe. taken together, these data suggest that scf mediated proteolysis may contribute to the regulation of entry into mitosis. our data, in combination with previously published results, also provide evidence for distinct scf complexes in vivo and support the idea that their f box subunits mediate scf substrate specificity.
