isolation of a cdc homologue from cryptococcus neoformans that is able to complement cdc temperature sensitive mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a partial cdna fragment of the cryptococcus neoformans homologue of the main cell cycle control gene cdc/cdc was isolated using degenerate primer rt pcr. a subsequent search in the c. neoformans genome database identified several sequences similar to cdc/cdc. a part of the sequence which showed the highest similarity to cdc/cdc turned out to be identical to the partial cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) cdna fragment isolated by degenerate rt pcr. the full length coding region of this cdk homologue was amplified by rt pcr using primers designed to target regions around start and stop codons, and the gene was named cncdk. to determine its function, an analysis of deduced amino acid sequence of the cncdk was performed and its ability to rescue saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc temperature sensitive mutants was tested. s. cerevisiae cdc and cdc n strains transformed with the pyes cncdk construct exhibited growth at . degrees c in galactose raffinose medium, but not in glucose medium. results of the sequence analysis and the fact that cncdk is able to complement the s. cerevisiae cdc ts mutation support its assumed role as the cdc/cdc homologue in c. neoformans.
