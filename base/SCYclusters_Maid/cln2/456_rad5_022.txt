indications for an inducible component of error prone dna repair in yeast.. . in a thermoconditional mutant of mutagenic dna repair (rev ts = rad ) of saccharomyces cerevisiae recovery of survival and mutation frequencies can be monitored by incubating uv irradiated cells in growth medium at a permissive temperature ( degrees c) before plating and a shift to restrictive temperature ( degrees c). inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide during incubation at permissive conditions blocks this rev dependent recovery process in stationary phase rev ts cells, whereas it can be reduced but not totally abolished in exponentially growing cells. these results indicate a strict dependence on post irradiation protein synthesis in stationary phase cells and argue for a considerable constitutive level and only limited inducibility in logarithmic phase cells. the uv inducibility of the rev coded function in stationary phase cells could be confirmed by analysis of the dose response pattern of the his reversion. in stationary phase rev ts cells, the quadratic component of the biphasic linear quadratic induction kinetics found at degrees c, which is interpreted as the consequence of induction of mutagenic repair, is eliminated at degrees c.
