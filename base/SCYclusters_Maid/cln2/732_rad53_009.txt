budding yeast rad is an atp dependent rad activating machine.. . we find budding yeast rad in two distinct, large, and soluble complexes in cell extracts. the larger (&gt; or = kda) complex, found in nondamaged cells, contains hypophosphorylated rad, whereas the smaller ( kda) complex, which forms after dna damage, contains hyperphosphorylated rad and rad. this smaller rad complex is capable of catalyzing phosphorylation and release of active rad kinase, a process requiring the kinase activity of rad. however, mec and tel are no longer required once the kda complex has been formed. we propose a model whereby mec/tel dependent hyperphosphorylation of rad results in formation of the smaller rad complex and recruitment of rad. this complex then catalyzes activation of rad by acting as a scaffold that brings rad molecules into close proximity, facilitating rad in trans autophosphorylation and subsequent release of activated rad.
