requirement of mismatch repair genes msh and msh in the rad rad pathway of mitotic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the rad and rad genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae are required for nucleotide excision repair and they also act in mitotic recombination. the rad rad complex has a single stranded dna endonuclease activity. here, we show that the mismatch repair genes msh and msh function in mitotic recombination. for both his and his duplications, and for homologous integration of a linear dna fragment into the genome, the msh delta mutation has an effect on recombination similar to that of the rad delta and rad delta mutations. the msh delta mutation also reduces the rate of recombination of the his duplication and lowers the incidence of homologous integration of a linear dna fragment. epistasis analyses indicate that msh and msh function in the rad rad recombination pathway, and studies presented here suggest an involvement of the rad rad pathway in reciprocal recombination. the possible roles of msh, msh, rad, and rad proteins in genetic recombination are discussed. coupling of mismatch binding proteins with the recombinational machinery could be important for ensuring genetic fidelity in the recombination process.
