a novel programed frameshift expresses the pol gene of retrotransposon ty of yeast. frameshifting without trna slippage.. . most retroviruses and retrotransposons express their pol gene as a translational fusion to the upstream gag gene, often involving translational frameshifting. we describe here an unusual translational frameshift event occurring between the gag and pol genes of the retrotransposon ty of yeast. a + frameshift occurs within the sequence gcg agu u (shown as codons of gag), encoding alanine valine (gcg a guu). unlike other programed translational frameshifts described, this event does not require trna slippage between cognate or near cognate codons in the mrna. two features distal to the gcg codon stimulate frameshifting. the low availability of the trna specific for the &quot;hungry&quot; serine codon, agu, induces a translational pause required for frameshifting. a sequence of nt distal to the agu codon (termed the ty &quot;context&quot;) also stimulates the event.
