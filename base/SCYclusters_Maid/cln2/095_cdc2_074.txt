nucleotide sequences of fic and fic genes involved in cell filamentation induced by cyclic amp in escherichia coli.. . the nucleotide sequences of fic involved in the cell filamentation induced by cyclic amp in escherichia coli and its normal counterpart fic were analyzed. the open reading frame of both fic and fic coded for amino acids. the gly at position in the fic protein was changed to arg in the fic protein. the promoter activity of fic was confirmed by fusing fic and lacz. the gene downstream from fic was found to be paba (p aminobenzoate). there is an open reading frame (orf) coding for amino acids upstream from the fic gene. computer assisted analysis showed that fic has sequence similarity with part of cdc of saccharomyces cerevisiae, cdc of schizosaccharomyces pombe, and ftsa of e. coli. in addition, orf has sequence similarity with the cyclosporin a binding protein cyclophilin.
