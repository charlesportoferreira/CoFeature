ever shorter telomere (est) dependent reverse transcription by candida telomerase in vitro. evidence in support of an activating function.. . telomerase is an rna protein complex responsible for the extension of one strand of the telomere terminal repeats. analysis of the telomerase complex in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed the presence of one catalytic protein subunit (estp/tert) and at least two noncatalytic components (estp and estp). the tert subunit is essential for telomerase function, both in vitro and in vivo. in contrast, the estp and estp subunits, although required for telomere extension in vivo, have not been shown to affect enzyme activity in vitro. we recently identified orthologues of the saccharomyces telomerase subunits in candida albicans (named catert, caestp, and caestp). analysis of telomerase from the candida caest delta strains revealed a primer specific defect in its activity in vitro. the mutant enzyme was impaired in its ability to extend some, but not all, telomeric primers. the caestp responsive primers have ' ends that are clustered in two loci within the bp candida telomere repeat. the degree of caestp dependence was modulated by the length and sequence of the ' ends. for caestp dependent primers, the wild type enzyme consistently exhibited a greater v(max) than the mutant enzyme in kinetic studies. these results suggest that caestp augments the ability of telomerase to reverse transcribe through selected barriers in the telomere repeat by acting as an allosteric activator and provide the basis for a functional in vitro assay for a noncatalytic protein component of the telomerase complex.
