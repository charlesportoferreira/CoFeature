the role of the est genes in yeast telomere replication.. . we have recently completed a large mutant screen designed to identify new mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae with a telomerase like defect. from this screen; mutants were identified that mapped to three genes, called est, est and est, as well as a novel est like mutation in a fourth gene, previously identified as cdc. mutations in each of these genes give rise to phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those observed when tlc, encoding the yeast telomerase rna, is deleted. in addition, genetic analysis indicates that all four genes function in the same pathway for telomere replication as defined by tlc, the one known component of telomerase. this indicates that these genes encode factors that are essential in vivo for telomerase function. genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that est and cdc encode single stranded telomeric dna binding proteins, suggesting that these two proteins may function to mediate access of telomerase to the end of the telomere.
