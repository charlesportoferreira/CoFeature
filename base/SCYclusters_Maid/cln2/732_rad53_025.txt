structure of the fha domain of yeast rad and identification of binding sites for both fha and its target protein rad.. . forkhead associated (fha) domains have been shown to recognize both pthr and ptyr peptides. the solution structures of the fha domain of rad from saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its complex with a ptyr peptide, have been reported recently. we now report the solution structure of the other fha domain of rad, fha (residues ), and identification of binding sites of fha and its target protein rad. the fha structure consists of beta strands, which form two large twisted anti parallel beta sheets folding into a beta sandwich. three short alpha helices were also identified. the beta strands are linked by several loops and turns. these structural features of free fha are similar to those of free fha, but there are significant differences in the loops. screening of a peptide library [xxx(pt)xxx] against fha revealed an absolute requirement for asp at the + position and a preference for ala at the + position. these two criteria are met by a pthr motif ()tead() in rad. surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that a pthr peptide containing this motif, ()slev(pt)eadatfvq() from rad, binds to fha with a k(d) value of . microm. other peptides containing ptxxd sequences also bound to fha, but less tightly (k(d)= microm). these results suggest that thr of rad is the likely phosphorylation site recognized by the fha domain of rad. the tight binding peptide was then used to identify residues of fha involved in the interaction with the pthr peptide. the results are compared with the interactions between the fha domain and a ptyr peptide derived from rad reported previously. copyright academic press.
