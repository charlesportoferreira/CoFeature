saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins involved in hybrid dna formation in vitro.. . reca like activities that can form hybrid dna in vitro have been identified in a wide variety of organisms. we have previously described the strand exchange protein (sep) from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae that can form hybrid dna in vitro. purified as an mr , polypeptide, recent molecular and immunological studies have now shown that the native form is an mr , polypeptide containing strand exchange activity. the gene encoding sep has been cloned and sequenced. the primary sequence failed to reveal any significant sequence homology to other sequences in data base searches. in vivo sep was found to be essential for normal meiosis as cells containing a homozygous insertion mutation in the sep gene failed to sporulate. in order to identify additional factors that are involved in hybrid dna formation in s cerevisiae, we used an in vitro stimulation assay to identify proteins that reconstitute strand exchange activity in reactions containing limiting amounts of sep. we have identified two proteins that functionally interact with sep. first, an mr , single stranded dna binding protein stimulated the reaction by lowering the requirement for sep about fold. this protein is a fragment of the large subunit of a hetero trimeric complex called yrp a (yrf a) which is thought to be the functional eukaryotic equivalent of single stranded dna binding proteins in prokaryotes. the gene encoding this protein (rpa) is essential for growth. second, an mr , polypeptide, termed stimulatory factor (sf), dramatically stimulated the sep catalyzed reaction by lowering the requirement for sep about fold.(abstract truncated at words)
