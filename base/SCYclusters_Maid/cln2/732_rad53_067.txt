orc and the intra s phase checkpoint. a threshold regulates radp activation in s phase.. . the intra s phase checkpoint in yeast responds to stalled replication forks by activating the atm like kinase mec and the chk related kinase rad, which in turn inhibit spindle elongation and late origin firing and lead to a stabilization of dna polymerases at arrested forks. a mutation that destabilizes the second subunit of the origin recognition complex, orc , reduces the number of functional replication forks by % and severely compromises the activation of rad by replication stress or dna damage in s phase. we show that the restoration of the checkpoint response correlates in a dose dependent manner with the restoration of pre replication complex formation in g. other forms of dna damage can compensate for the reduced level of fork dependent signal in the orc mutant, yet even in wild type cells, the amount of damage required for rad activation is higher in s phase than in g. our data suggest the existence of an s phase specific threshold that may be necessary to allow cells to tolerate damage like dna structures present at normal replication forks.
