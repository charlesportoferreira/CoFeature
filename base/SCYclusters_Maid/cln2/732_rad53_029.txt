the brct domain of the s. cerevisiae checkpoint protein rad mediates a rad rad interaction after dna damage.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint protein rad is required for transient cell cycle arrest and transcriptional induction of dna repair genes in response to dna damage []. it contains a carboxyterminal tandem repeat of the brct (brca carboxyl terminus) motif, a motif that is also found in many proteins involved in various aspects of dna repair, recombination and checkpoint control [][]. we produced yeast strains expressing rad in which the brct domain had been deleted or which harboured point mutations in the highly conserved aromatic residue of each brct motif. rates of survival and checkpoint delay of the mutants after ultraviolet (uv) irradiation were essentially equivalent to those of raddelta (null) cells, demonstrating that the brct domain is required for rad function. rad hyperphosphorylation, which occurs after dna damage [][][], was absent in the brct mutants, as was rad dependent phosphorylation of the rad protein. a two hybrid approach identified a specific interaction between the rad brct domain and itself. biochemical analysis in vitro and in vivo confirmed this interaction and, furthermore, demonstrated that the rad brct domain preferentially interacted with the hyperphosphorylated forms of rad. this interaction was suppressed by mutations of the brct motifs that caused null phenotypes in vivo, suggesting that rad oligomerization is required for rad function after dna damage.
