analysis of mutagenic dna repair in a thermoconditional repair mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae. i. influence of cycloheximide on uv irradiated stationary phase revts cells.. . using the thermoconditional yeast mutant revts that controls an apparently site specific step of mutagenic dna repair it was possible to measure the time course of rev dependent uv induced reversion of the ochre allele his and recovery of survival for uv treated stationary phase cells. due to the revts coded protein being active at degrees c, survival and mutation frequencies increased with duration of incubation under permissive conditions in growth medium before the temperature was shifted to degrees c (restrictive temperature). this increase was abolished in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. furthermore, the rev dependent recovery of survival could be blocked or nearly blocked by cycloheximide added at any time during repair. therefore, rev dependent repair can be characterized as a process requiring concomitant protein synthesis. these findings give further support to the concept that in yeast, mutagenesis involves uv inducible components of dna repair.
