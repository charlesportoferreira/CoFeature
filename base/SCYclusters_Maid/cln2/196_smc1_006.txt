mitotic chromosome condensation in the rdna requires trf and dna topoisomerase i in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . dna topoisomerase i (topo i) is known to participate in the process of dna replication, but is not essential in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the trf gene is also nonessential and was identified in a screen for mutations that are inviable in combination with a top null mutation. here we report the surprising finding that a top trf ts double mutant is defective in the mitotic events of chromosome condensation, spindle elongation, and nuclear segregation, but not in dna replication. direct examination of rdna containing mitotic chromosomes demonstrates that a top trf ts mutant fails both to establish and to maintain chromosome condensation in the rdna at mitosis. we show that the trfp associates physically with both smclp and smcp, the s. cerevisiae homologs of xenopus proteins that are required for mitotic chromosome condensation in vitro. the defect in the top trf ts mutant is sensed by the mad dependent spindle assembly checkpoint but not by the rad dependent dna damage checkpoint, further supporting the notion that chromosome structure influences spindle assembly. these data indicate that top (encoding topo i) and trf participate in overlapping or dependent steps in mitotic chromosome condensation and serve to define a previously unrecognized biological function of topo i.
