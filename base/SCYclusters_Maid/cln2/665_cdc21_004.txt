cloning, purification, and properties of candida albicans thymidylate synthase.. . the thymidylate synthase (ts) gene was isolated from a genomic candida albicans library by functional complementation of a saccharomyces cerevisiae strain deficient in ts. the gene was localized on a kilobase hindiii dna fragment and was shown to be expressed in a thy strain of escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of the ts gene predicted a protein of amino acids with a molecular weight of ,. the gene was cloned into a t expression vector in e. coli, allowing purification of large amounts of c. albicans ts. it was also purified from a wild type c. albicans strain. comparison of several enzyme properties including analysis of amino terminal amino acid sequences showed the native and cloned c. albicans ts to be the same.
