orientation dependent and sequence specific expansions of ctg/cag trinucleotide repeats in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a quantitative and selective genetic assay was developed to monitor expansions of trinucleotide repeats (tnrs) in yeast. a promoter containing repeats allows expression of a ura reporter gene and yields sensitivity to the drug fluoroorotic acid. expansion of the tnr to or more repeats turns off ura and provides drug resistance. when integrated at either of two chromosomal loci, expansion rates were x ( ) to x ( ) per generation if ctg repeats were replicated on the lagging daughter strand. pcr analysis indicated that additional repeats were present in % of the expanded alleles. no significant changes in ctg expansion rates occurred in strains deficient in the mismatch repair gene msh or the recombination gene rad. the frequent nature of ctg expansions suggests that the threshold number for this repeat is below in this system. in contrast, expansions of the complementary repeat cag occurred at to , fold lower rates, similar to a randomized (c,a,g) control sequence. when the reporter plasmid was inverted within the chromosome, switching the leading and lagging strands of replication, frequent expansions were observed only when ctg repeats resided on the lagging daughter strand. among the rare cag expansions, the largest gain in tract size was repeats. the control repeats cta and tag showed no detectable rate of expansions. the orientation dependence and sequence specificity data support the model that expansions of ctg and cag tracts result from aberrant dna replication via hairpin containing okazaki fragments.
