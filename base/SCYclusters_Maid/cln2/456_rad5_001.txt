protein protein interactions within an e ring finger complex. implications for ubiquitin dependent dna damage repair.. . the ring finger protein rad interacts and cooperates with the ubc mms ubiquitin conjugating enzyme in postreplication dna damage repair in yeast. previous observations implied that the function of ubc and mms is dependent on the presence of rad, suggesting that the ring finger protein might act as a ubiquitin protein ligase specific for the ubc mms complex. in support of this notion it is shown here that the contact surfaces between the rad ring domain and ubc correspond to those found in other pairs of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin protein ligases. mutations that compromise the protein protein interactions either between the ring domain and ubc or within the ubc mms dimer were found to have variable effects on repair activity in vivo that strongly depended on the expression levels of the corresponding mutants. quantitative analysis of the affinity and kinetics of the ubc mms interaction suggests a highly dynamic association model in which compromised mutual interactions result in phenotypic effects only under conditions where protein levels become limiting. finally, this study demonstrates that beyond its cooperation with the ubc mms dimer, rad must have an additional role in dna damage repair independent of its ring finger domain.
