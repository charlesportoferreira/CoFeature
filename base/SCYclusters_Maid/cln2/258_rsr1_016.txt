unipolar cell divisions in the yeast s. cerevisiae lead to filamentous growth. regulation by starvation and ras.. . diploid s. cerevisiae strains undergo a dimorphic transition that involves changes in cell shape and the pattern of cell division and results in invasive filamentous growth in response to starvation for nitrogen. cells become long and thin and form pseudohyphae that grow away from the colony and invade the agar medium. pseudohyphal growth allows yeast cells to forage for nutrients. pseudohyphal growth requires the polar budding pattern of a/alpha diploid cells; haploid axially budding cells of identical genotype cannot undergo this dimorphic transition. constitutive activation of ras or mutation of shr, a gene required for amino acid uptake, enhance the pseudohyphal phenotype; a dominant mutation in rsr/bud that causes random budding suppresses pseudohyphal growth.
