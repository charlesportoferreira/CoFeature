rad regulates dbf independently of checkpoint function in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cdcp and dbfp proteins form an active kinase complex in saccharomyces cerevisiae that is essential for the initiation of dna replication. a genetic screen for mutations that are lethal in combination with cdc led to the isolation of seven lsd (lethal with seven defect) complementation groups. the lsd complementation group contained two temperature sensitive dbf alleles. the lsd complementation group contained a new allele of rad, which was designated rad . rad encodes an essential protein kinase that is required for the activation of dna damage and dna replication checkpoint pathways, and that is implicated as a positive regulator of s phase. unlike other rad alleles, we demonstrate that the rad allele retains an intact checkpoint function. thus, the checkpoint function and the dna replication function of rad can be functionally separated. the activation of dna replication through rad most likely occurs through dbf. two hybrid analysis indicates that the radp protein binds to dbfp. furthermore, the steady state level of dbf message and dbfp protein is reduced in several rad mutant strains, indicating that rad positively regulates dbf. these results suggest that two different functions of the cell cycle, initiation of dna replication and the checkpoint function, can be coordinately regulated through the common intermediate rad.
