the ashbya gossypii genome as a tool for mapping the ancient saccharomyces cerevisiae genome.. . we have sequenced and annotated the genome of the filamentous ascomycete ashbya gossypii. with a size of only . megabases, encoding protein coding genes, it is the smallest genome of a free living eukaryote yet characterized. more than % of a. gossypii genes show both homology and a particular pattern of synteny with saccharomyces cerevisiae. analysis of this pattern revealed inversions and translocations that have occurred since divergence of these two species. it also provided compelling evidence that the evolution of s. cerevisiae included a whole genome duplication or fusion of two related species and showed, through inferred ancient gene orders, which of the duplicated genes lost one copy and which retained both copies.
