crosstalk between the rasp controlled mitogen activated protein kinase and camp pathways during invasive growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the two highly conserved ras genes of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae are redundant for viability. here we show that haploid invasive growth development depends on ras but not ras. rasp is not sufficiently expressed to induce invasive growth. rasp activates invasive growth using either of two downstream signaling pathways, the filamentation mapk (cdcp/step/mapk) cascade or the camp dependent protein kinase (cyrp/camp/pka) pathway. this signal branch point can be uncoupled in cells expressing rasp mutant proteins that carry amino acid substitutions in the adenylyl cyclase interaction domain and therefore activate invasive growth solely dependent on the mapk cascade. both rasp controlled signaling pathways stimulate expression of the filamentation response element driven reporter gene depending on the transcription factors step and tecp, indicating a crosstalk between the mapk and the camp signaling pathways in haploid cells during invasive growth.
