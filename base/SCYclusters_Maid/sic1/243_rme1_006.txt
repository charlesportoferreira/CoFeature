dissection of the dna binding domain of yeast zn finger protein rmep, a repressor of meiotic activator ime.. . a series of deletion mutants of the yeast zn finger protein rmep (repressor of meiosis) fused with maltose binding protein (mbp) were constructed, purified, and characterized to examine the dna binding domain. it was shown by gel retardation assay that the dna binding domain of rmep was attributed to c terminal amino acid residues to . all three zn fingers are involved in the dna binding domain, but they are not sufficient for dna binding ability. notably, the c terminal region (residues ) is essential for dna binding. provided that the region folds into alpha helix, the basic amino acid residues may form a ridge on one side of the helix, whereas the hydrophobic residues may form it on the other side. thus, the dna binding domain of rmep would be dissected two regions. the roles of c terminal region in dna recognition will be discussed.
