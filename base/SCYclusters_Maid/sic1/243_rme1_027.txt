activation of basal transcription by a mutation in sin, a yeast global repressor, occurs through a mechanism different from activator mediated transcriptional enhancement.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein sin has been suggested to affect the transcription of various genes by locally altering chromatin structure. previous studies have defined two classes of promoters. those which are activated by loss of sin function (termed sin responsive promoters) and those which are not activated by sin mutations (termed sin non responsive promoters). we analyzed the mechanism of this differential response of the two classes of promoters to a sin mutation. the sin non responsive promoters were activated when upstream elements in the promoter region were eliminated. the upstream elements of sin non responsive promoters were, in turn, found to repress the activity of the sin responsive promoters in an orientation independent manner. the sin mediated activation was repressed by the rme but not by the tup ssn mediated repression system. activation of sin responsive promoters by pho and the sin mutation was additive, and enhancement of transcription driven by sin responsive promoters was found to be due to an increase in the basal rate of transcription. the upstream regions in the sin non responsive promoters contained elements that were able to inhibit activation of basal transcription. based on these observations, we suggest that activation of basal transcription by a mutation in a gene for a global repressor, sin, occurs through a mechanism that differs from that responsible for activator mediated transcriptional enhancement, and we therefore propose that basal transcription and activator mediated transcription are repressed by different mechanisms.
