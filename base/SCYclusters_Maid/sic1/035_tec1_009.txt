fus controls ty transpositional dormancy through the invasive growth mapk pathway.. . fus, the mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) of the mating pheromone response pathway, inhibits a post translational step of ty retrotransposition. fus also inhibits haploid invasive growth by blocking cross activation of invasive growth gene expression by the pheromone response signal cascade. here, we show that fus kinase activity and dosage co ordinately regulate ty transposition and invasive growth. a chromosomal copy of the kinase defective fus kr allele fails to inhibit either ty transposition or invasive growth. when overexpressed, kinase defective fus weakly inhibits both ty transposition and invasive growth, but is much less inhibitory than wild type fus expressed at the same level. moreover, increasing the dosage of wild type fus intensifies the inhibition of both ty transposition and invasive growth. to demonstrate that fus regulates ty transposition via its negative regulation of the invasive growth pathway, we show by epistatic analysis that the invasive growth pathway transcription factors ste and tec are both required for fus mediated inhibition of ty transposition. when haploid invasive growth is stimulated by high copy expression of tec, by expression of the dominant hypermorphic allele ste or by deletion of hog, ty transposition is concomitantly activated. in summary, these results demonstrate that the haploid invasive growth pathway activates ty transposition at both transcriptional and post transcriptional levels and that fus inhibits ty transposition by inhibiting the invasive growth pathway.
