mexp mediates nuclear export of a variety of rna polymerase ii transcripts.. . mexp is essential for nuclear poly(a)(+) rna export in yeast, but which specific transcripts are transported by mexp is not known. we observed that thermosensitive mex cells do not produce a heat shock response at degrees c but will induce heat shock proteins (hsp) (e.g. hspp and hspp) when shifted back from the restrictive to permissive temperature ( degrees c). this memory of a previous heat stress in mex cells could be explained if hsp mrnas accumulated inside the nucleus during heat shock and were exported and translated in the cytoplasm on return to the permissive temperature. to test this hypothesis, nuclear export of heat shock mrnas was directly analyzed by in situ hybridization using fluorescent labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for ssa transcripts. this revealed that mexp is required for nuclear export of heat shock mrnas. furthermore, other polymerase ii transcripts encoding the transcriptional repressor ash and the glycolytic enzyme pgk are shown to require mexp for their export into the cytoplasm. thus, mexp is an mrna export factor for a broad range of polymerase ii transcripts.
