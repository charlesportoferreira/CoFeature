evidence that the pre mrna splicing factor clfp plays a role in dna replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . clfp is an essential, highly conserved protein in s. cerevisiae that has been implicated in pre mrna splicing. clfp's ortholog in drosophila, crn, is required for normal cell proliferation. cells depleted of clfp arrest primarily with large buds, a single nucleus, a c dna content, and a short, intact mitotic spindle. we isolated temperature sensitive clf mutants that exhibit similar mitotic defects when released to the restrictive temperature from an early s phase block. while these mutants also accumulate unspliced pre mrna at the restrictive temperature, the mitotic arrest does not appear to result from a failure to splice tubulin pre mrna. moreover, the same mutants exhibit a delayed entry into s phase when released to the restrictive temperature from a g phase block. this delay could not be suppressed by disruption of the s phase cdk inhibitor sic, suggesting that clfp is involved in dna replication. consistent with this possibility, we find that clfp (but not the mutant clfp) interacts with the dna replication initiation protein orcp in two hybrid and co immunoprecipitation assays, that clfp preferentially associates with origins of dna replication, and that this association is orcp dependent. these observations suggest that clfp plays a direct role in the initiation of dna replication.
