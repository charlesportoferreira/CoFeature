proteasomal proteomics. identification of nucleotide sensitive proteasome interacting proteins by mass spectrometric analysis of affinity purified proteasomes.. . ubiquitin dependent proteolysis is catalyzed by the s proteasome, a dynamic complex of different proteins whose mode of assembly and mechanism of action are poorly understood, in part due to the difficulties encountered in purifying the intact complex. here we describe a one step affinity method for purifying intact s proteasomes, s regulatory caps, and s core particles from budding yeast cells. affinity purified s proteasomes hydrolyze both model peptides and the ubiquitinated cdk inhibitor sic. affinity purifications performed in the absence of atp or presence of the poorly hydrolyzable analog atp gamma s unexpectedly revealed that a large number of proteins, including subunits of the skp cullin f box protein ligase (scf) and anaphase promoting complex (apc) ubiquitin ligases, copurify with the s cap. to identify these proteasome interacting proteins, we used a recently developed method that enables the direct analysis of the composition of large protein complexes (dalpc) by mass spectrometry. using dalpc, we identified more than putative proteasome interacting proteins, including ylrc (daq), which we demonstrate to be a new subunit of the budding yeast s cap, and ygrw (nas), which is homologous to a subunit of the mammalian s cap (pa complex). additional pips include the heat shock proteins hsp and hsp, the deubiquitinating enzyme ubp, and proteins involved in transcriptional control, mitosis, tubulin assembly, rna metabolism, and signal transduction. our data demonstrate that nucleotide hydrolysis modulates the association of many proteins with the s proteasome, and validate dalpc as a powerful tool for rapidly identifying stoichiometric and substoichiometric components of large protein assemblies.
