chitin synthetase distribution on the yeast plasma membrane.. . purified, intact yeast plasma membranes were allowed to synthesize chitin, and the nascent chains of polysaccharide were observed either by the fluorescence produced with a brightener or by autoradiography. by both methods, it was concluded that the newly formed chitin emerged at many sites on each membrane. thus, the synthetase that catalyzes chitin formation has a similar distribution. since chitin synthetase is found mainly in a zymogen form, these results confirm the hypothesis that initiation of the chitinous primary septum of saccharomyces occurs by localized activation of the uniformly distributed zymogen.
