phosphorylation of sicp by g cdk required for its degradation and entry into s phase.. . g cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) triggered degradation of the s phase cdk inhibitor sicp has been implicated in the transition from g to s phase in the cell cycle of budding yeast. a multidimensional electrospray mass spectrometry technique was used to map g cdk phosphorylation sites in sicp both in vitro and in vivo. a sicp mutant lacking three cdk phosphorylation sites did not serve as a substrate for cdcp dependent ubiquitination in vitro, was stable in vivo, and blocked dna replication. moreover, purified phosphosicp was ubiquitinated in cyclin depleted g extract, indicating that a primary function of g cyclins is to tag sicp for destruction. these data suggest a molecular model of how phosphorylation and proteolysis cooperate to bring about the g/s transition in budding yeast.
