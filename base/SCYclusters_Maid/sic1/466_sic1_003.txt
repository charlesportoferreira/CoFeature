structural basis for phosphodependent substrate selection and orientation by the scfcdc ubiquitin ligase.. . cell cycle progression depends on precise elimination of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors by the ubiquitin system. elimination of the cdk inhibitor sic by the scfcdc ubiquitin ligase at the onset of s phase requires phosphorylation of sic on at least six of its nine cdc phosphodegron (cpd) sites. a . a x ray crystal structure of a skp cdc complex bound to a high affinity cpd phosphopeptide from human cyclin e reveals a core cpd motif, leu leu pthr pro, bound to an eight bladed wd propeller domain in cdc. the low affinity of each cpd motif in sic reflects structural discordance with one or more elements of the cdc binding site. reengineering of cdc to reduce selection against sic sequences allows ubiquitination of lower phosphorylated forms of sic. these features account for the observed phosphorylation threshold in sic recognition and suggest an equilibrium binding mode between a single receptor site in cdc and multiple low affinity cpd sites in sic.
