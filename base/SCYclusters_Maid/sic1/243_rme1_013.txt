aar/tup protein, with a structure similar to that of the beta subunit of g proteins, is required for a alpha and alpha repression in cell type control of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have cloned a dna fragment complementing the aar mutation defective in the a alpha repression of the alpha cistron and haploid specific genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. nucleotide sequence and mapping data indicated that the aar gene is identical with tup, which is allelic to the sfl, flk, cyc, umr, amm, and aer genes, whose mutations are known to confer a variety of phenotypes, such as thymidine uptake, flocculation, insensitivity to glucose repression, a defect in uv induced mutagenesis, and a defect in ars plasmid maintenance. the tup/aer protein is known to have significant similarity with the beta subunits of g proteins in the c terminal half, in two glutamine rich domains in the n terminal half, and in a central region rich in serine and threonine residues. disruption of the chromosomal aar gene in alpha and a/alpha cells conferred the nonmating phenotype, and the a/alpha diploids could not sporulate. the aar/tup gene is transcribed into a . kb mrna independently of the mating type information of the cell. these observations and mrna analysis of cell type specific genes indicated that the aar/tup protein is also indispensable for a alpha repression of rme and for alpha repression of a specific genes.
