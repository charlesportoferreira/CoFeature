activation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation/invasion pathway by osmotic stress in high osmolarity glycogen pathway mutants.. . mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) cascades are frequently used signal transduction mechanisms in eukaryotes. of the five mapk cascades in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the high osmolarity glycerol response (hog) pathway functions to sense and respond to hypertonic stress. we utilized a partial loss of function mutant in the hog pathway, pbs , in a high copy suppressor screen to identify proteins that modulate growth on high osmolarity media. three high copy suppressors of pbs osmosensitivity were identified. msg, cak, and trx. msgp is a dual specificity phosphatase that was previously demonstrated to dephosphorylate mapks in yeast. deletions of the putative mapk targets of msgp revealed that kssdelta could suppress the osmosensitivity of pbs . kssp is phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic shock in a pbs strain, but not in a wild type strain nor in a pbs strain overexpressing msg. both tec and fre.lacz expressions are activated in strains lacking a functional hog pathway during osmotic stress in a filamentation/invasion pathway dependent manner. additionally, the cellular projections formed by a pbs mutant on high osmolarity are absent in strains lacking kss or ste. these data suggest that the loss of filamentation/invasion pathway repression contributes to the hog mutant phenotype.
