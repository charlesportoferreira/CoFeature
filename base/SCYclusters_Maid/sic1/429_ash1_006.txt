ash mrna localization in yeast involves multiple secondary structural elements and ash protein translation.. . localization of ash mrna to the distal cortex of daughter but not mother cells at the end of anaphase is responsible for the two cells' differential mating type switching during the subsequent cell cycle. this localization depends on actin filaments and a type v myosin (she/myo). the ' untranslated region (' utr) of ash mrna is reportedly capable of directing heterologous rnas to a mother cell's bud [] []. surprisingly, however, its replacement has little or no effect on the localisation of ash mrna. we show here that, unlike all other known localization sequences that have been found in ' utrs, all the elements involved in ash mrna localization are located at least partly within its coding region. a nucleotide region stretching from nucleotides ' to nucleotides ' of the stop codon of ash mrna is sufficient to localize mrnas to buds; the secondary structure of this region, in particular two stems, is important for its localizing activity. two regions entirely within coding sequences, both sufficient to localize green fluorescent protein (gfp) mrna to growing buds, are necessary for ash mrna localization during anaphase. these three regions can anchor gfp mrna to the distal cortex of daughter cells only inefficiently. the tight anchoring of ash mrna to the cortex of the daughter cell depends on translation of the carboxy terminal sequences of ash protein.
