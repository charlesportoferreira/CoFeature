the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitory domain of the yeast sic protein is contained within the c terminal amino acids.. . by inhibiting the activity of cdc/clb cyclin dependent protein kinase (cdk) complexes, sic prevents the premature initiation of s phase in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. by testing a series of sic truncation mutants, we have mapped the minimal domain necessary for cdc/clb inhibition in vivo to the c terminal amino acids of sic. site directed mutagenesis was used to show that a sequence that matches the zrxl motif found in mammalian cdk inhibitors is essential for sicl function. this motif is not found in the schizosaccharomyces cdk inhibitor prum, which appears to be a structural and functional homolog of sicl. based on the mutational data and sequence comparisons, we argue that sic and prum are structurally distinct from the known mammalian cdk inhibitors, but may bind cdk complexes in a manner more closely resembling cdk substrates like the retinoblastoma and ef proteins.
