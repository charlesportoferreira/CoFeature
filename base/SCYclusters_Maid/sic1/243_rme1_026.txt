cellular differentiation in response to nutrient availability. the repressor of meiosis, rmep, positively regulates invasive growth in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transition from a nutrient rich to a nutrient limited growth medium typically leads to the implementation of a cellular adaptation program that results in invasive growth and/or the formation of pseudohyphae. complete depletion of essential nutrients, on the other hand, leads either to entry into a nonbudding, metabolically quiescent state referred to as g in haploid strains or to meiosis and sporulation in diploids. entry into meiosis is repressed by the transcriptional regulator rmep, a zinc finger containing dna binding protein. in this article, we show that rmep positively regulates invasive growth and starch metabolism in both haploid and diploid strains by directly modifying the transcription of the flo (also known as muc) and sta genes, which encode a cell wall associated protein essential for invasive growth and a starch degrading glucoamylase, respectively. genetic evidence suggests that rmep functions independently of identified signaling modules that regulate invasive growth and of other transcription factors that regulate flo and that the activation of flo is dependent on the presence of a promoter sequence that shows significant homology to identified rmep response elements (rres). the data suggest that rmep functions as a central switch between different cellular differentiation pathways.
