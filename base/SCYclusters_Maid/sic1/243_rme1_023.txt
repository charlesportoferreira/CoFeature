regulation of mating and meiosis in yeast by the mating type region.. . a supposed sporulation deficient mutation of saccharomyces cerevisiae is found to affect mating in haploids and in diploids, and to be inseparable from the mating type locus by recombination. the mutation is regarded as a defective a allele and is designated a*. this is confirmed by its dominance relations in diploids, triploids, and tetraploids. tetrad analysis of tetraploids and of their sporulating diploid progeny suggests the existence of an additional locus, rme, which regulates sporulation in yeast strains that can mate. thus the recessive homozygous constitution rme/rm enables the diploids a*/alpha, a/a*, and alpha/alpha to go through meiosis. haploids carrying rme show apparent premeiotic dna replication in sporulation conditions. this new regulatory locus is linked to the centromere of the mating type chromosome, and its two alleles, rme and rme, are found among standard laboratory strains.
