genomic footprinting of the yeast zinc finger protein rmep and its roles in repression of the meiotic activator ime.. . the zinc finger protein rmep is a negative regulator of the meiotic activator ime in saccharomyces cerevisiae . prior studies have shown that rmep binds in vitro to a site near nt in the ime upstream region, but a genomic mutation in that site has little effect on repression of ime . to identify rmep binding sites in vivo , we have examined the binding of rmep to genomic sites through in vivo footprinting. we show that rmep binds to two sites in the ime upstream region, near nt and . mutations in both binding sites abolish repression of chromosomal ime by rmep, whereas a mutation in either single site causes partial derepression. therefore, both rmep binding sites are essential for repression of ime . prior studies have shown that repression by rmep depends upon rgr and sin , which specify rna polymerase ii mediator subunits that are required for normal nucleosome density. we find that rgr and sin are not simply required for rmep to bind to dna in vivo . these results suggest that rmep functions directly as a repressor of ime and that rgrp and sinp are required for dna bound rmep to exert repression.
