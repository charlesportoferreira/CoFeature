isolation of chitin synthetase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. purification of an enzyme by entrapment in the reaction product.. . chitin synthetase, in the zymogen form, was extracted with digitonin from a particulate fraction from saccharomyces cerevisiae and converted into active form by treatment with immobilized trypsin. when the activated enzyme was incubated with udp glcnac and other components of an assay mixture, a chitin precipitate formed, trapping a large portion of the synthetase. the enzyme was easily extracted frm the chitin gel with a recovery of approximately % and an enrichment of approximately fold. further purification was obtained by repeating the chitin step. after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the purified synthetase showed a major band corresponding to mr ,, a weaker band at mr ,, and some other minor bands. under nondenaturing conditions, an mr of , was calculated for the enzyme from stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient determinations. after electrophoresis in a nondenaturing gel and incubation with the components of the standard assay, chitin was formed and precipitated in the gel, yielding an opaque band. soluble oligosaccharides were not precursors for insoluble chitin, suggesting that synthesis of chitin chains takes place by a processive mechanism. n acetylglucosamine stimulated the purified synthetase only slightly and did not participate as a primer in the reaction. the same chain length, somewhat more than units of glcnac, was determined in samples of chitin that had been synthesized either in vivo, or with a membrane preparation or with purified synthetase. these results suggest that chitin synthetase itself is capable both of initiating chitin chains without a primer and of determining their length.
