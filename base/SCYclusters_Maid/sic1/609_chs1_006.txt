hormone induced expression of the chs gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . when mata cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae have been treated with the mating hormone alpha factor an increase in chitin synthase zymogen, as well as chitin content in the cell wall fraction, have been reported. with a dna probe derived from the cloned chs gene that codes for chitin synthase i [bulawa, c. e., slater, m., cabib, e., au young, j., sburlati, a., adair, w. l. and robbins, p. () cell , ] a northern analysis was conducted of chs specific transcripts. alpha factor treated mata cells revealed more than sixfold elevated steady state levels of chs mrna as compared to control cells. mat alpha cells responded the same way when treated with a factor although induction rate was somewhat smaller. after hormone application a rapid increase in chs mrna levels could be observed that occurred also in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis. in order to minimize possible side effects of chs coding sequences on expression and mrna stability a chs.suc chimaeric gene was constructed where bp of the chs promoter region (+ bp of the coding region) were fused in frame to a fragment of the suc coding region. the fusion protein exhibits invertase activity that has been used to monitor chs promoter activity. by analysis of shortened versions of the chs promoter a bp dna fragment has been identified that confers hormone inducibility to the chs promoter. according to the published sequence of the chs gene, this fragment contains four repeats of a tgaaaca consensus sequence previously identified in the alpha factor inducible bar promoter [kronstad, j. w., holly, j. a. and mackay, v. l. () cell , ]. this heptamer may represent the cis acting element involved in mating hormone mediated gene expression in yeast.
