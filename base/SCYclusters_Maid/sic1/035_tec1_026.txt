involvement of sre element of ty transposon in tec dependent transcriptional activation.. . some ty transposable element insertion mutations of saccharomyces cerevisiae activate transcription of adjacent genes in a cell type dependent manner. this activation requires at least ste and tec gene products. the binding site for the ste protein is located in the sterile responsive element (sre), which is just downstream the ' ltr of ty and contains one copy of the pheromone response element (pre). this report defines the sequences in ty required for tec dependent activation using a tdh.lacz reporter gene in which the uas was replaced by different portions of a ty or ty element. the ty sre seems to be sufficient to ensure the tec and ste mediated activation whereas ty sre can activate the expression of the adjacent genes in the absence of both proteins. adjacent to the pre element, there is a region (pae) with extensive sequence divergence in ty and ty sres. swapping experiments between ty and ty sequences show that ty pae is required for the activation of adjacent gene expression in a tec and ste dependent manner. the use of a lexa.tec construct indicates that the chimeric protein has no activation ability suggesting that tec could act in conjunction with another factor.
