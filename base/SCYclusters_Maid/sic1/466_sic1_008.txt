multisite phosphorylation of a cdk inhibitor sets a threshold for the onset of dna replication.. . scf ubiquitin ligases target phosphorylated substrates for ubiquitin dependent proteolysis by means of adapter subunits called f box proteins. the f box protein cdc captures phosphorylated forms of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor sic for ubiquitination in late g phase, an event necessary for the onset of dna replication. the wd repeat domain of cdc binds with high affinity to a consensus phosphopeptide motif (the cdc phospho degron, cpd), yet sic itself has many sub optimal cpd motifs that act in concert to mediate cdc binding. the weak cpd sites in sic establish a phosphorylation threshold that delays degradation in vivo, and thereby establishes a minimal g phase period needed to ensure proper dna replication. multisite phosphorylation may be a more general mechanism to set thresholds in regulated protein protein interactions.
