rim encodes a meiotic activator required for early events of meiosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . rim was previously found to be required for both the ime and ime dependent pathways of meiotic gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we now demonstrate that rim is also required for meiotic division and recombination. furthermore, rimdelta mutants show defects in premeiotic dna synthesis, which can be suppressed by deletion of the sic gene, which encodes a cdk inhibitor. expression of rim is induced early in meiosis, and is dependent on ime but not ime. indeed, rim itself is essential for the meiotic expression of ime. these results suggest that rim is epistatic to ime, and is required for multiple steps during sporulation. in agreement with this interpretation, overexpression of rim induces low levels of sporulation in rich medium.
