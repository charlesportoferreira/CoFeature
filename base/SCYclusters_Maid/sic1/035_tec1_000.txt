sta repression of sta gene expression is caused by a defective activator, flo, in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the expression of sta genes that encode extracellular glucoamylase isozymes is repressed in most laboratory saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, which are believed to contain an undefined repressor, designated sta. to identify the regulator involved in sta repression, we investigate the flo, msn, mss, ste, and tec genes. the deltaflo or deltamss deletion mutants in the sta genetic background exhibit both a loss of flocculation ability and a reduction in extracellular glucoamylase activity, as in the sta strain. moreover, the sta repression is suppressed completely or partially by the introduction of a single copy of the flo or mss genes. sequence analysis and complementation testing of the sta strain reveal that it has an inactive, mutated flo allele. a random spore analysis and transplacement (allele replacement) experiment confirms that the repressive phenotype of sta is due to the amber mutation of the transcriptional activator, flo.
