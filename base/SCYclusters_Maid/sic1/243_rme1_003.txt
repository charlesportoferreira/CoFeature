the mating type proteins of fission yeast induce meiosis by directly activating mei transcription.. . cell type control of meiotic gene regulation in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a cascade of transcriptional repressors, a alpha and rme. here, we investigate the analogous regulatory pathway in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe by analyzing the promoter of mei, the single gene whose expression is sufficient to trigger meiosis. the mei promoter does not appear to contain a negative regulatory element that represses transcription in haploid cells. instead, correct regulation of mei transcription depends on a complex promoter that contains at least five positive elements upstream of the tata sequence. these elements synergistically activate mei transcription, thereby constituting an on off switch for the meiosis pathway. element c is a large region containing multiple sequences that resemble binding sites for mc, an hmg domain protein encoded by the mating type locus. the function of element c is extremely sensitive to spacing changes but not to linker scanning mutations, suggesting the possibility that mc functions as an architectural transcription factor. altered specificity experiments indicate that element d interacts with pm, a homeodomain protein encoded by the mating type locus. this indicates that pm functions as a direct activator of the meiosis pathway, whereas the homologous mating type protein in s. cerevisiae (alpha) functions as a repressor. thus, despite the strong similarities between the mating type loci of s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, the regulatory logic that governs the tight control of the key meiosis inducing genes in these organisms is completely different.
