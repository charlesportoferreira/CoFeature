genetic regulation of differentiation towards meiosis in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . normally, meiosis and sporulation in saccharomyces cerevisiae occur only in diploid strains and only when the cells are exposed to starvation conditions. diploidy is determined by the mating type system (the genes mat, rme, ime), whereas the starvation signal is transmitted through the adenylate cyclase protein kinase pathway (the genes cdc, ras, cdc (cyr), bcy, tpk, tpk, tpk). the two regulatory pathways converge at the gene ime, which is a positive regulator of meiosis and whose early expression in sporulating cells correlates with the initiation of meiosis. sites upstream (') of ime appear to mediate in the repression of the gene by repressors originating from both the mating type and the cyclase kinase pathways.
