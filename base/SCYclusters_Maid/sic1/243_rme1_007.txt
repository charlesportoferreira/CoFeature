requirement for rgr and sin in rme dependent repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . rme is a zinc finger protein homolog that functions as a repressor of the meiotic activator ime. rme is unusual among yeast repressors in two respects. it acts over a considerable distance ( kbp) and it can activate transcription from a binding site separated from its natural flanking region. to identify genes required for rme to exert repression, we have selected mutants with improved rme dependent activation. one rare mutant was defective in rme dependent repression of an artificial reporter gene as well as the native ime gene. the mutation permits sporulation of a/a diploids, which express rme from its natural promoter, and of a/alpha diploids constructed to express rme from the gal promoter. the mutation also causes temperature sensitive growth and a methionine or cysteine requirement. analysis of a complementing genomic clone indicates that the mutation lies in a known essential gene, rgr. prior studies have indicated a functional relationship between rgr and sin (also called tsf); we have found that a sin null mutation also causes a defect in rme dependent repression and a methionine or cysteine requirement. the rgr and sin mutations do not cause a reduction of rme polypeptide levels. the defect in rme dependent repression may result from effects of sin and, presumably, rgr on chromatin structure.
