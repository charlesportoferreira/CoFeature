skp connects cell cycle regulators to the ubiquitin proteolysis machinery through a novel motif, the f box.. . we have identified the yeast and human homologs of the skp gene as a suppressor of cdc mutants and as a cyclin f binding protein. skpp indirectly binds cyclin a/cdk through skpp, and directly binds skpp, cyclin f, and cdcp through a novel structural motif called the f box. skp is required for ubiquitin mediated proteolysis of cinp, clbp, and the cdk inhibitor sicp, and provides a link between these molecules and the proteolysis machinery. a large number of proteins contain the f box motif and are thereby implicated in the ubiquitin pathway. different skp mutants arrest cells in either g or g, suggesting a connection between regulation of proteolysis in different stages of the cycle.
