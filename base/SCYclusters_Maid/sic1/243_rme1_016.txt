mating type control in saccharomyces cerevisiae. isolation and characterization of mutants defective in repression by a alpha .. . the alpha protein, the product of the mat alpha cistron, represses various genes specific to the a mating type (alpha repression), and when combined with the mata gene product, it represses mat alpha and various haploid specific genes (a alpha repression). one target of a alpha repression is rme, which is a negative regulator of a/alpha specific genes. we have isolated recessive mutants whose a alpha repression is defective but which retain alpha repression in a genetic background of ho mata hml alpha hmra sir or ho mat alpha hmra hmra sir. these mutations can be divided into three different classes. one class contains a missense mutation, designated hml alpha , in the alpha cistron of hml, and another class contains two mat alpha , in the mat alpha locus. these three mutants each have an amino acid substitution of tyrosine or acid substitution of tyrosine or phenylalanine for cysteine at the rd codon from the translation initiation codon in the alpha cistron of hml alpha or mat alpha. the remaining mutants make up the third class and form a single complementation group, having mutations designated aar (a alpha repression), at a gene other than mat, hml, hmr, rme, or the four sir genes. although a diploid cell homozygous for the aarl and sir mutations and for the mata, hml alpha, and hmra alleles showed alpha mating type, it could sporulate and gave rise to asci containing four alpha mating type spores. these facts indicate that the domain for alpha repression is separable from that for a alpha protein interaction or complex formation in the alpha protein and that an additional regulation gene, aar, is associated with the a alpha repression of the alpha cistron and haploid specific genes.
