chitinase and chitin synthase . counterbalancing activities in cell separation of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . previous results [e. cabib, a. sburlati, b. bowers &amp; s. j. silverman () journal of cell biology , ] strongly suggested that the lysis observed in daughter cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in chitin synthase (chs) was caused by a chitinase that partially degrades the chitin septum in the process of cell separation. consequently, it was proposed that in wild type cells, chs acts as a repair enzyme by replenishing chitin during cytokinesis. the chitinase requirement for lysis has been confirmed in two different ways. (a) demethylallosamidin, a more powerful chitinase inhibitor than the previously used allosamidin, is also a much better protector against lysis and (b) disruption of the chitinase gene in chs cells eliminates lysis. reintroduction of a normal chitinase gene, by transformation of those cells with a suitable plasmid, restores lysis. the percentage of lysed cells in strains lacking chs was not increased by elevating the chitinase level with high copy number plasmids carrying the hydrolase gene. furthermore, the degree of lysis varied in different chs strains; lysis was abolished in chs mutants containing the scs suppressor. these results indicate that, in addition to chitinase, lysis requires other gene products that may become limiting.
