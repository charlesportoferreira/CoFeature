dual role of the saccharomyces cerevisiae tea/atts family transcription factor tecp in regulation of gene expression and cellular development.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the transcription factors tecp and step are required for haploid invasive and diploid pseudohyphal growth. tecp and step have been postulated to regulate these developmental processes primarily by cooperative binding to filamentous and invasion responsive elements (fres), which are combined enhancer elements that consist of a tecp binding site (tcs) and an stelp binding site (pre). they are present in the promoter regions of target genes, e.g., flo. here, we show that tecp efficiently activates target gene expression and cellular development in the absence of stelp. we further demonstrate that tcs elements alone are sufficient to mediate tecp driven gene expression by a mechanism termed tcs control that is operative even when stelp is absent. mutational analysis of tec revealed that tcs control, flo expression, and haploid invasive growth require the c terminus of tecp. in contrast, the step dependent fre control mechanism is sufficiently executed by the n terminal portion of tecp, which contains the tea/atts dna binding domain. our study suggests that regulation of haploid invasive and diploid pseudohyphal growth by stelp and tecp is not only executed by combinatorial control but involves additional control mechanisms in which stelp activates tec expression via clustered pres and where tecp regulates expression of target genes, e.g., flo, by tcs control.
