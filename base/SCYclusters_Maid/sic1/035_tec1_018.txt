the cell surface flocculin flo is required for pseudohyphae formation and invasion by saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . diploid yeast develop pseudohyphae in response to nitrogen starvation, while haploid yeast produce invasive filaments which penetrate the agar in rich medium. we have identified a gene, flo, that encodes a cell wall protein which is critically required for both invasion and pseudohyphae formation in response to nitrogen starvation. flo encodes a cell surface flocculin with a structure similar to the class of yeast serine/threonine rich gpi anchored cell wall proteins. cells of the saccharomyces cerevisiae strain sigmab with deletions of flo do not form pseudohyphae as diploids nor invade agar as haploids. in rich media, flo is regulated by mating type; it is expressed in haploid cells but not in diploids. upon transfer to nitrogen starvation media, however, flo transcripts accumulate in diploid cells, but not in haploids. overexpression of flo in diploid cells, which are otherwise not invasive, enables them to invade agar. thus, the mating type repression of flo in diploids grown in rich media suffices to explain the inability of these cells to invade. the promoter of flo contains a consensus binding sequence for step and tecp, proteins known to cooperatively activate transcription of ty elements and the tec gene during development of pseudohyphae. yeast with a deletion of ste does not express flo transcripts, indicating that ste is required for flo expression. these ste deletion strains also do not invade agar. however, the ability to invade can be restored by overexpressing flo. activation of flo may thus be the primary means by which step and tecp cause invasive growth.
