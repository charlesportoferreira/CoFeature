mutations of the ck phosphorylation site of sic affect cell size and s cdk kinase activity in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . by sequence analysis we found an amino acid stretch centred on serine matching a stringent ck consensus site within the c terminal, inhibitory domain of sic. here we show by direct mass spectrometry analysis that sic, but not a mutant protein whose ck phospho acceptor site has been mutated to alanine, sicsa, is actually phosphorylated in vitro by ck on serine . mutation of serine alters the coordination between growth and cell cycle progression. a significant increase of average protein content and of the average protein content at the onset of dna synthesis is observed for exponentially growing cells harbouring the sicsa protein. a strong reduction of the same parameters is observed in cells harbouring sicse. the deregulated coordination between cell size and cell cycle is also apparent at the level of s cdk activity.
