an inhibitor of pcdc protein kinase activity from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the pcdc protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae is a homolog of the pcdc protein kinase, a fundamental regulator of cell division in all eukaryotic cells. once activated it initiates the visible events of mitosis (chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindle formation). the pcdc protein also has a critical role in the initiation of dna synthesis. the protein kinase activity is regulated by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and by periodic association with cyclins. an endogenous kilodalton protein (p) originally identified as a substrate of the pcdc protein kinase was purified. the p protein bound tightly to pcdc and inhibited the activity of the kinase. the p protein may provide another mechanism to regulate pcdc protein kinase activity.
