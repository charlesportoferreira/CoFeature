cooperative binding interactions required for function of the ty sterile responsive element.. . the step transcription factor controls the expression of ty transposable element insertion mutations and genes whose products are required for mating in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the binding site for step is a consensus dna sequence known as a pheromone response element (pre). upstream activating sequences (uass) derived from known step dependent genes have previously been characterized to require either multiple pres or a single pre coupled to a binding site for a second protein. the step dependent uas from ty, called a sterile response element (sre), is of the second type and is comprised of a pre and an adjacent tea (tef , tec, and abaa motif) dna consensus sequence (tcs). in this report, we show by uv cross linking analysis that two proteins, step and a protein with an apparent size of kda, directly contact the ty sre. other experiments show that tecp is required for formation of the ty sre protein dna complex and is physically present in the complex. these results establish a direct role for tecp in the ty sre and yet another set of combinatorial interactions that achieve a qualitatively distinct mode of transcriptional regulation with step.
