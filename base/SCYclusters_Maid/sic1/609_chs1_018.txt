improved assay and mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the chitin synthase from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . . an improved filtration method is introduced to perform kinetic investigations on the chitin synthase reaction. this method is especially suited for the assay of a large number of samples necessary in enzyme kinetic studies. . from initial rate data the possibility could be excluded that the two substrate reactions occurs by a random or a ping pong mechanism. . investigations of product inhibition exclude a rapid random mechanism but favour an ordered mechanism with udp n acetylglucosamine as the first substrate. . this result was confirmed by isotope exchange studies.
