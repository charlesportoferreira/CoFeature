dual regulation of the yeast cdc p protein kinase complex. cell cycle, pheromone, and nutrient limitation effects.. . a kd polypeptide that coprecipitates with the cdc gene product in immune complexes is specifically phosphorylated by the cdc protein kinase. using this reaction, we detect activity only in extracts from dividing g phase cells. exit from g by entry into s phase or the preconjugatory state induced by mating pheromone correlates with loss of p phosphorylation activity. inactive extracts from cdc mutants complement extracts from cells arrested in s or m phase, suggesting that non g cells are deficient in an exchangeable activating factor. stationary and pheromone treated cultures are rich in this exchangeable factor, but possess an inactive kinase that is not activated by complementation. camp deficient mutants resemble stationary cells.
