activation of chitin synthetase in permeabilized cells of a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacking proteinase b.. . digitonin treatment at degrees c of a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant lacking proteinase b permeabilized the cells and caused rapid and extensive activation of chitin synthetase in situ. the same result was obtained with a mutant generally defective in vacuolar proteases. by lowering the temperature and using different permeabilization procedures, we showed that increases in permeability and activation are distinct processes. activation was inhibited by the protease inhibitors antipain and leupeptin, but by pepstatin or chymostatin. metal chelators were also inhibitory, and their effect was reversed by the addition of ca+ but not by mg+. antipain added together with ca+ after incubation of the cells in the presence of a chelating agent prevented reversal of inhibition, a result that was interpreted as indicating that antipain acts either on the same step affected by ca+ or on a subsequent step. efforts to obtain activation in cell free extracts were unsuccessful, but it was possible to extract the synthetase, once activated, by breaking permeabilized cells with glass beads. treatment of the cell free extracts with trypsin led not only to increased activity of chitin synthetase, but also to a change in the ph activity curve and a diminished requirement by the enzyme for free n acetylglucosamine. these observations suggest that the modification undergone by the synthetase during endogenous activation is different from that brought about by trypsin treatment.
