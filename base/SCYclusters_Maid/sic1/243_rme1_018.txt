a long region upstream of the ime gene regulates meiosis in yeast.. . meiosis and sporulation in yeast are subject to two types of regulation. the first depends on environmental conditions. the second depends on a genetic pathway which involves the control of the positive regulatory gene ime by rme, which is in turn controlled by the mat locus. the presence of ime on a multicopy plasmid enables cells to undergo meiosis regardless of their genotype at mat or rme. we show here that a multicopy plasmid carrying ime also enables meiosis, regardless of the environment. therefore, both kinds of regulation appear to act through ime. furthermore, the behavior of multicopy plasmids carrying various segments from the ime region suggests that the region upstream of ime contains both positive and negative regulatory sites. control of ime by the environment and by the mat pathway both act through negative regulatory sites.
