ime, a gene that mediates mat and nutritional control of meiosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, sporulation occurs in response to nutritional and genetic signals. the process is initiated when nutrient availability limits mitotic growth, but only in mata/mat alpha diploid cells. under these conditions, the cells express an activator of meiosis (ime), which is required for the expression of early sporulation specific genes. we describe a new gene, ime, whose activity is essential for ime transcript accumulation and sporulation. the ime transcript was induced in starved mata/mat alpha diploids but not in other cell types. in addition, excess ime promoted sporulation in mat insufficient cells. thus, ime appears to activate ime in response to cell type and nutritional signals. we have also explored the interactions between ime and two genes that are known to regulate ime expression. normally, cells that lack complete mat information cannot sporulate; when such strains lack rme activity or contain the semidominant res mutation, however, they can express ime and sporulate to low levels. our results show that mat insufficient strains containing rme.leu or res bypass mutations still retain mat control of ime expression. even though ime levels remained low, the rme.leu and res mutations allowed ime accumulation, implying that these mutations do not require ime to exert their effects. in accord with this interpretation, the res mutation allowed ime accumulation in mata/mat alpha strains that contain ime.leu alleles. these strains still sporulated poorly, suggesting that ime plays a role in sporulation in addition to promoting ime transcript accumulation. ime is located between ade and lys on chromosome vii.
