a role of the c terminal region adjacent to the zinc fingers in the dna binding ability of rmep, a regulator of meiosis in s. cerevisiae.. . rmep is a zinc finger protein and has a pivotal role in control of meiosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the dna binding domain of rmep consists of three zinc finger segments and the c terminal amino acid residues (called c tr). to examine the role of c tr, a series of mutant rmep fused with maltose binding protein (mbp) were constructed, purified, and characterized, in terms of the dna binding ability. the basic amino acid residues r and k, and the hydrophobic residues f, l, , and l play an important role for dna binding, suggesting that the c tr forms an amphipathic alpha helix. also, it was shown that the mutations in the basic amino acid residues abolish the repression and inhibition of spore formation by rmep in vivo. hence, the c tr is important for in vivo function of rmep.
