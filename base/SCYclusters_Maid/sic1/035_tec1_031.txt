the mating factor response pathway regulates transcription of tec, a gene involved in pseudohyphal differentiation of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the transcription factor tec is involved in pseudohyphal differentiation and agar invasive growth of saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. the sole element in the tec promoter that has thus far been shown to control tec function is the filament response element. we find that the tec promoter also contains several pheromone response element sequences which are likely to be functional. tec transcription is induced by mating factor, cell cycle regulated and dependent on the ste, ste and ste components of the mating factor signal transduction pathway. using alleles of the transcription factor ste that are defective in dna binding, transcriptional induction or cooperativity with other transcription factors, we find little correlation between tec transcript levels and agar invasive growth.
