an rme independent pathway for sporulation control in saccharomyces cerevisiae acts through ime transcript accumulation.. . the res mutation was isolated on the basis of its ability to allow mata/mat alpha diploid saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to express a late sporulation regulated gene, spr, in the presence of excess copies of rme. rme is a repressor of meiosis that is normally expressed in cells that lack the a/alpha repressor encoded by mat. the res mutation also supports sporulation in mat insufficient diploids. this phenotype does not result from a failure to express rme and is not due to activation of the silent copies of mating type information. res activates sporulation by allowing ime accumulation in all cell types, irrespective of the presence of the mat products. ime is still responsive to rme in res cells, since double mutants (rme res ) that are deficient at mat can sporulate better than either single mutant. res is not an allele of ime.
