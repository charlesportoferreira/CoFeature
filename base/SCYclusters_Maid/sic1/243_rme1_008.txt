repression by the yeast meiotic inhibitor rme.. . the rme gene product, a negative regulator of meiosis with three zinc finger motifs, acts by preventing transcript accumulation from ime, whose product is required for meiotic gene expression. we have isolated a bp segment from a region kb upstream of ime that is sufficient for rme dependent repression of a heterologous promoter. this dna contains an rme response element (rre) and another region called the modulation region. the modulation region is required for repression because dna containing the rre alone did not repress but was able to confer rme dependent transcriptional activation of a reporter gene. in gel mobility retardation assays, rme formed a specific complex with the rre, and rre point mutations that reduced the affinity for rme also blocked repression and activation. footprinting of the rme rre complex revealed a bp protected region that included the positions of these rre mutations. we conclude that rme binding to this rre is required for repression. thus, the mechanism of meiotic inhibition by rme is direct transcriptional repression of ime.
