control of the yeast cell cycle is associated with assembly/disassembly of the cdc protein kinase complex.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene cdc encodes a protein kinase required for progression from g to s phase in the cell cycle. we present evidence that the active form of the cdc protein kinase is a complex of approximately kd containing an endogenous substrate, p, and possibly other polypeptides. this complex phosphorylates p and exogenous histone h in vitro. cell cycle arrest during g results in inactivation of the protein kinase accompanied by the disassembly of the complex. furthermore, assembly of the complex is regulated during the cell cycle, reaching a maximum during g. partial complexes thought to be intermediates in the assembly process phosphorylate histone h but not p. addition of soluble factors to these partial complexes in vitro restores p phosphorylation and causes the complex to increase to the mature size. a model is presented in which p phosphorylation is required during g for cells to initiate a new cell cycle.
