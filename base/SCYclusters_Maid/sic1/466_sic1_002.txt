context of multiubiquitin chain attachment influences the rate of sic degradation.. . the ubiquitin dependent targeting of proteins to the proteasome is an essential mechanism for regulating eukaryotic protein stability. here we define the minimal signal for the degradation of the s phase cdk inhibitor sic. of lysines scattered throughout sic, n terminal lysines serve as major ubiquitination sites. sic lacking these lysines (kn) is stable in vivo, but readdition of any one restores turnover. nevertheless, ubiquitin chains attached at different n terminal lysines specify degradation in vitro at markedly different rates. moreover, although kn can be ubiquitinated by scf(cdc)/cdc in vitro in the absence (but not in the presence) of s cdk, it is degraded slowly. our results reveal that a single multiubiquitin chain can sustain a physiological turnover rate, but that chain position plays an unexpectedly significant role in the rate of proteasomal proteolysis.
