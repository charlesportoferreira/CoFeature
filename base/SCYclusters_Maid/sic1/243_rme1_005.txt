transcriptional repression at a distance through exclusion of activator binding in vivo.. . the yeast repressor rmep acts from distant binding sites to block transcription of the chromosomal ime gene. rmep can also repress the heterologous cyc promoter when rmep binding sites are placed bp upstream of cyc transcriptional activator binding sites (uas and uas). here, in vivo footprinting studies indicate that rmep acts over this distance by preventing the binding of the cyc transcriptional activators to uas and uas. inhibition of activator binding by rmep has the same genetic requirements as repression. both depend upon sequences flanking the rmep binding sites and upon rgrp and sinp, two subunits of the rna polymerase ii associated mediator complex that are required for normal nucleosome density. thus rmep may alter chromatin to prevent binding of transcriptional activators to distant dna sequences.
