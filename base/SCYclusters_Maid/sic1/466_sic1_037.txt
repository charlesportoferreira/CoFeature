the cdk activating kinase cakp promotes meiotic s phase through imep.. . cak encodes an essential protein kinase in saccharomyces cerevisiae that is required for activation of the cdcp cdk. cak also has several cdc independent functions that are unique to meiosis. the earliest of these functions is to induce s phase, which is regulated differently in meiosis than in mitosis. in mitosis, cdcp controls its own s phase promoting activity by signaling the destruction of its inhibitor, sicp. in meiosis, sicp destruction is signaled by the meiosis specific imep protein kinase. our data show that cakp is required to activate imep through a mechanism that requires threonine and tyrosine in imep's activation loop. this activation promotes autophosphorylation and accumulation of multiply phosphorylated forms of imep during meiotic development. consistent with cakp's role in activating imep, cells lacking cakp are deficient in degrading sicp. deletion of sic or overexpression of ime can partially suppress the s phase defect in cak mutant cells, suggesting that imep is a key target of cakp regulation. these data show that cakp is required for the destruction of sicp in meiosis, as in mitosis, but in meiosis, it functions through a sporulation specific kinase.
