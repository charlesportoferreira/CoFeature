repression and activation domains of rmep structurally overlap, but differ in genetic requirements.. . rmep, a repressor of meiosis in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, acts as both a transcriptional repressor and activator. rmep is a zinc finger protein with no other homology to any protein of known function. the c terminal dna binding domain of rmep is essential for function. we find that mutations and progressive deletions in all three zinc fingers can be rescued by fusion of rme to the dna binding domain of another protein. thus, structural integrity of the zinc fingers is not required for the rmep mediated effects on transcription. using a series of mutant rme proteins, we have characterized domains responsible for repression and activation. we find that the minimal transcriptional repression and activation domains completely overlap and lie in an amino acid n terminal segment (aa ). an additional transcriptional effector determinant lies in the first amino acids of the protein. notwithstanding the complete overlap between repression and activation domains of rmep, we demonstrated a functional difference between repression and activation. rgrp and sinp are absolutely required for repression but dispensable for activation.
