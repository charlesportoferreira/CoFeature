chitin synthetase zymogen is attached to the yeast plasma membrane.. . pretreatment of yeast protoplasts with concanavalin a, according to the method used by g. a. scarborough for neurospora (j. biol. chem. , , ), reinforced the plasma membranes, and helped to maintain their integrity during subsequent lysis of the protoplasts. after purification by centrifuging on a renografin density gradient, practically intact membranes were obtained. previous labeling of the protoplasts with i or with [h]concanavalin a resulted in recovery of the radioactivity in the membrane fraction. the bulk of the chitin synthetase (chitin synthase; udp acetamido deoxy d glucose.chitin beta acetamidodeoxyglucosyltransferase; ec ...) recovered in the gradient was also found in this fraction; in the zymogen form. about % of the activity sedimented in a plasma membrane free fraction at lower density. glutaraldehyde inactivated chitin synthetase when it was added to a lysate, but not when applied to intact protoplasts. it is concluded that chitin synthetase is so oriented in the membrane that it is only accessible from the inside of the cell. these results confirm our previous hypothesis that the chitin synthetase zymogen is associated with the plasma membrane, a basic assumption for the explanation of localized activation of the enzyme and initiation of septum formation.
