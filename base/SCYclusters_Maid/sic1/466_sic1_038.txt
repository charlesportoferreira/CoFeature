release of ubiquitin charged cdc s ub from the ring domain is essential for ubiquitination of the scf(cdc) bound substrate sic.. . the s. cerevisiae scf(cdc) is a prototype of ring type scf es, which recruit substrates for polyubiquitination by the cdc ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. current models propose that cdc ubiquitinates the substrate while remaining bound to the ring domain. in contrast, we found that the formation of a ubiquitin thiol ester regulates the cdc/scf(cdc) binding equilibrium by increasing the dissociation rate constant, with only a minor effect on the association rate. by using a fvcdc mutant with increased affinity for the ring domain, we demonstrate that release of ubiquitin charged cdc s ub from the ring is essential for ubiquitination of the scf(cdc) bound substrate sic. release of ubiquitin charged e from e prior to ubiquitin transfer is a previously unrecognized step in ubiquitination, which can explain both the modification of multiple lysines on the recruited substrate and the extension of polyubiquitin chains. we discuss implications of this finding for function of other ubiquitin ligases.
