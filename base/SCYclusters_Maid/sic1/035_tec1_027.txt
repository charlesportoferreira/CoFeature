tec, a gene involved in the activation of ty and ty mediated gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae. cloning and molecular analysis.. . ty and ty mediated gene expression observed in haploid cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on several determinants, some of which are required for the expression of haploid specific genes. we report here the cloning and molecular analysis of tec. tec encodes a amino acid protein that is a trans acting factor required for full ty expression and ty mediated gene activation. however, mutation or deletion of the tec gene had little effect on total ty transcript levels. our analysis provides clear evidence that tec is not involved in mating or sporulation processes. unlike most of the proteins involved in ty and adjacent gene expression, the product of tec has no known cellular function. although there was no mating type effect on tec expression, our results indicate that the tec and the a/alpha diploid controls on ty expression are probably not cumulative.
