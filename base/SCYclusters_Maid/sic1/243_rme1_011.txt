the yeast rme gene encodes a putative zinc finger protein that is directly repressed by a alpha .. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, a/alpha cells can enter meiosis whereas a and alpha cells cannot. the a/alpha cell type is determined by presence of a repressor, a alpha . previous studies indicate that a/alpha cells lack an inhibitor of meiosis, the rme gene product, and that a and alpha cells express rme. we report here the sequence of rme and functional analysis of its regulatory and coding regions. the ' region of rme includes a sequence resembling a alpha repression sites. deletion of this site at rme relieves repression by a alpha , and insertion of the site into a heterologous regulatory region (cyc) confers weak repression in a/alpha cells. these observations indicate that rme is directly repressed by a alpha . the rme product has three regions that resemble ch zinc fingers, which are characteristic of a class of nucleic acid binding proteins. substitution of serine for cysteine in each of the putative fingers abolishes rme function; serine substitutions in the second and third putative fingers do not affect rme stability. these findings indicate that at least two putative zinc fingers are critical for rme structure or activity. therefore rme, which is formally a negative regulator of the meiotic gene ime, may act directly as a repressor.
