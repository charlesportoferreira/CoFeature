ime, a positive regulator gene of meiosis in s. cerevisiae.. . ime (inducer of meiosis) was cloned due to its high copy number effect. it enabled mat insufficient strains to undergo meiosis. disruption of ime results in a recessive spo phenotype. diploids homozygous for the two mutations ime , rme are also meiosis deficient. we conclude that ime is a positive regulator of meiosis that normally is repressed by rme. rme is repressed by a complex of mata and mat alpha gene products. ime is also regulated by the environment. no transcripts could be detected in glucose growing cells, in contrast to acetate growing cells. starvation for nitrogen further induced ( to fold) transcription of ime, but, as expected, the induction was found only in mata/mat alpha or rme /rme diploids. furthermore, the ime multicopy plasmids promoted sporulation in rich media.
