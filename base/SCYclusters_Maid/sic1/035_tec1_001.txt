amino acid starvation and gcnp regulate adhesive growth and flo gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in baker's yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell cell and cell surface adhesion are required for haploid invasive growth and diploid pseudohyphal development. these morphogenetic events are induced by starvation for glucose or nitrogen and require the cell surface protein flop. we show that amino acid starvation is a nutritional signal that activates adhesive growth and expression of flo in both haploid and diploid strains in the presence of glucose and ammonium, known suppressors of adhesion. starvation induced adhesive growth requires flop and is under control of gcnp and gcnp, elements of the general amino acid control system. tpkp and flop, elements of the camp pathway, are also required for activation but not step and tecp, known targets of the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade. promoter analysis of flo identifies one upstream activation sequence (uasr) and one repression site (urs) that confer regulation by amino acid starvation. gcnp is not required for regulation of the uasr by amino acid starvation, but seems to be indirectly required to overcome the negative effects of the urs on flo transcription. in addition, gcnp controls expression of flo by affecting two basal upstream activation sequences (uasb). in summary, our study suggests that amino acid starvation is a nutritional signal that triggers a gcnp controlled signaling pathway, which relieves repression of flo gene expression and induces adhesive growth.
