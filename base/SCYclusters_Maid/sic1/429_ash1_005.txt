structural elements required for the localization of ash mrna and of a green fluorescent protein reporter particle in vivo.. . the sorting of the ash protein to the daughter nucleus of saccharomyces cerevisiae in late anaphase of the budding cycle correlates with the localization of ash mrna at the bud tip [] []. although the ' untranslated region (' utr) of ash is sufficient to localize a reporter mrna, it is not necessary, a result which indicates that other sequences are involved []. we report the identification of three additional cis acting elements in the coding region. each element alone, when fused to a lacz reporter gene, was sufficient for the localization of the lacz mrna reporter to the bud. a fine structure analysis of the ' utr element showed that its function in mrna localization did not depend on a specific sequence but on the secondary and tertiary structure of a minimal nucleotide stem loop. mutations in the stem loop that affect the localization of the lacz mrna reporter also affected the formation of the localization particles, in living cells, composed of a green fluorescent protein (gfp) complexed with lacz ash ' utr mrna []. a specific stem loop in the ' utr of the ash mrna is therefore required for both localization and particle formation, suggesting that complex formation is part of the localization mechanism. an analysis on one of the coding region elements revealed a comparable stem loop structure with similar functional requirements.
