deletion of bgl results in an increased chitin level in the cell wall of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . it is shown that the deletion of bgl gene leads to increase in chitin content in the cell wall of saccharomyces cerevisiae. a part of the additional chitin can be removed from the bgldelta cell wall by alkali or trypsin treatment. chitin synthase (chs) activity was increased by % in bgldelta mutant. no increase in chitin synthase (chs) activity in bgldelta cells was observed, while they became more sensitive to nikkomycin z. the chitin level in the cell walls of a strain lacking both bgl and chs genes was higher than that in chsdelta and lower than that in bgldelta strains. together these data indicate that the deletion of bgl results in the accumulation and abnormal incorporation of chitin into the cell wall of s. cerevisiae, and both chs and chs take part in a response to bgl deletion in s. cerevisiae cells.
