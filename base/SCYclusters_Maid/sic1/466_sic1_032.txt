an inhibitor of yeast cyclin dependent protein kinase plays an important role in ensuring the genomic integrity of daughter cells.. . the gene encoding a kda protein, previously studied as a substrate and inhibitor of the yeast cyclin dependent protein kinase, cdc, has been cloned. the dna sequence reveals that p is a highly charged protein of , da with no significant homology to other proteins. overexpression of the gene encoding p, sic, produces cells with an elongated but morphology similar to that of cells with depleted levels of the clb gene products, suggesting that p acts as an inhibitor of cdc clb complexes in vivo. a sic deletion is viable and has highly increased frequencies of broken and lost chromosomes. the deletion strain segregates out many dead cells that are primarily arrested at the g checkpoint in an asymmetric fashion. only daughters and young mothers display the lethal defect, while experienced mothers appear to grow normally. these results suggest that negative regulation of cdc protein kinase activity by p is important for faithful segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells.
