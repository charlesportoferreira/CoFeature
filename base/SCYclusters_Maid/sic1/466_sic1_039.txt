control of landmark events in meiosis by the cdk cdc and the meiosis specific kinase ime.. . meiosis is thought to require the protein kinase ime early for dna replication and the cyclin dependent kinase cdc late for chromosome segregation. to elucidate the roles of these kinases, we inhibited their activities early and late using conditional mutants that are sensitive to chemical inhibitors. our studies reveal that both cdc and ime have critical roles in meiotic s phase and m phase. early inhibition of analog sensitive cdc as blocked dna replication, revealing a previously undetected role for cdc. yet cdc was dispensable for one of its functions in the mitotic cell cycle, degradation of sic. late addition of inhibitor to ime as revealed unexpected roles of ime in the initiation and execution of chromosome segregation. the requirement of ime for m phase is partially explained by its stimulation of the key meiotic transcription factor ndt, which is needed in turn for high cdc activity. in accordance with a late role for ime, we observed an increase in its activity during m phase that depended on cdc and ndt. we speculate that several unique features of the meiotic cell division reflect a division of labor and regulatory coordination between ime and cdc.
