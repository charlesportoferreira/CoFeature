the cdk inhibitors prum and psic are functional homologues that play similar roles in the regulation of the cell cycle in fission and budding yeast.. . prum and psic are specific inhibitors of p(cdc/cdc) kinase complexes with b type cyclins that play a central role in the regulation of the g phase of the cell cycle. we show here that low levels of expression of sic in schizosaccharomyces pombe rescues all the phenotypes of cells lacking the rum+ gene. in addition, high level expression of sic in s. pombe induces extra rounds of dna replication without mitosis, a phenotype very similar to the overexpression of rum+. transient expression of rum+ in s. cerevisiae restores the g arrest phenotype of cdc sicdelta double mutants. overproduction of rum+ in saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a cell cycle block in g with a phenotype similar to inactivation of all the clb cyclins. finally, we have mapped the cyclin interacting domain and cdk inhibitory domain to a region of about amino acids in prum that has significant homology to the c terminal domain of psic. all these observations suggest that fission yeast prum and budding yeast psic define a family of cdk inhibitors that specifically down regulate cyclin b/cdk during the g phase of the cell cycle.
