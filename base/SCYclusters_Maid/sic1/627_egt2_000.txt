the localization change of ybrw/ecm, a yeast gpi associated protein, from the plasma membrane to the cell wall, affecting the cellular function.. . the ybrw/ecm gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) attached protein and its disruptant strain exhibited a temperature sensitive (ts) growth defect. a ha tagged ybrw protein, which complemented the ts growth phenotype of the ybrwdelta strain, was predominantly located on the plasma membrane by gpi anchoring. to examine the requirement of the gpi anchoring on the plasma membrane for the function, the omega minus region of ybrw was replaced with those of ydrc/fit and ynlw/egt, which are known as gpi dependent cell wall proteins. the replacement induced the change in localization of the mutant proteins from the plasma membrane to the cell wall and the mutant proteins lost the function to complement the ts cell growth defect of the ybrwdelta strain. in addition, a similar result was obtained in a mutant protein, where the authentic skksk sequence at the omega to omega site of ybrw was replaced with a synthetic issys sequence. it is concluded that the gpi anchoring on the plasma membrane is required for the ybrw function.
