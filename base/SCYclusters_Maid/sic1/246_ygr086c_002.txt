pilp and lspp negatively regulate the phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase like kinase pkhp and downstream signaling pathways pkcp and ypkp.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs, pkh/p, of the mammalian phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase (pdk) regulate the pkc map kinase cascade and the partially parallel ypk/p pathway(s) that control growth and cell integrity. mammalian pdk is regulated by phosphoinositides, whereas pkh/p are regulated by sphingolipid long chain bases (lcbs). recently pkh/p were found to complex with two related proteins, pilp (ygr) and lspp (ypl). because these two proteins are not related to any known protein we sought to characterize their functions. we show that pkhp phosphorylates both proteins in vitro in a reaction that is only weakly regulated by lcbs. in contrast, lcbs inhibit phosphorylation of pilp by pkhp, whereas lcbs stimulate phosphorylation of lspp by pkhp. we find that pilp and lspp down regulate resistance to heat stress and, specifically, that they down regulate the activity of the pkcp map and ypkp pathways during heat stress. pilp and lspp are thus the first proteins identified as regulators of pkh/p. an unexpected finding was that the level of ypkp is greatly reduced in pkcdelta cells, indicating that pkcp controls the level of ypkp. homologs of pilp and lspp are widespread in nature, and our results suggest that they may be negative regulators of pdk like protein kinases and their downstream cellular pathways that control cell growth and survival.
