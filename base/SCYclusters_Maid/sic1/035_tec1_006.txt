transcriptional control of dimorphism in candida albicans.. . candida albicans uses a network of multiple signaling pathways to control the yeast &gt;hypha transition. these include a mitogen activated protein kinase pathway through cph, the camp dependent protein kinase pathway via efg, a ph responsive pathway through rim, the tup mediated repression through rfg and nrg, and pathways represented by transcription factors cph, tec and czf. these pathways control the transcription of a common set of hypha specific genes, many of which encode known virulence factors. the link between the signaling pathways and hyphal elongation is currently unknown, but there is evidence to suggest that cdc likely plays a key role in hyphal morphogenesis. unlike pseudohyphal growth in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hyphal elongation is regulated independently of the cell cycle. cellular differences between pseudohyphae and hyphae are further revealed by septin localization.
