selective degradation of ubiquitinated sic by purified s proteasome yields active s phase cyclin cdk.. . selective degradation of single subunits of multimeric complexes by the ubiquitin pathway underlies multiple regulatory switches, including those involving cyclins and cdk inhibitors. the machinery that segregates ubiquitinated proteins from unmodified partners prior to degradation remains undefined. we report that ubiquitinated sic (ub sic) embedded within inactive s phase cyclin cdk (s cdk) complexes was rapidly degraded by purified s proteasomes, yielding active s cdk. mutant proteasomes that failed to degrade ub sic activated s cdk only partially in an atp dependent manner. whereas ub sic was degraded within approximately min, spontaneous dissociation of ub sic from s cdk was approximately fold slower. we propose that the s proteasome has the intrinsic capability to extract, unfold, and degrade ubiquitinated proteins while releasing bound partners untouched. activation of s cdk reported herein represents a complete reconstitution of the regulatory switch underlying the g/s transition in budding yeast.
