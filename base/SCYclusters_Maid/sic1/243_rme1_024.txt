mating type and sporulation in yeast. i. mutations which alter mating type control over sporulation.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiosis and spore formation as well as mating are controlled by mating type genes. diploids heterozygous for mating type (aalpha) can sporulate but cannot mate; homozygous aa and alpha alpha diploids can mate, but cannot sporulate. from an alpha alpha diploid parental strain, we have isolated mutants which have gained the ability to sporulate. those mutants which continue to mate as alpha alpha cells have been designated csp (control of sporulation). upon sporulation, csp mutants yield asci containing alpha spores. the mutant gene which allows alpha alpha cells to sporulate is unlinked to the mating type locus and also acts to permit sporulation in aa diploid cells. segregation data from crosses between mutant alpha alpha and wild type aa diploids and vice versa indicate (for all but one mutant) that the mutation which allows constitutive sporulation (csp) is dominant over the wild type allele. some of the csp mutants are temperature sensitive, sporulating at degrees, but not at degrees. in addition to csp mutants, our mutagenesis and screening procedure led to the isolation of mutants which sporulate by virtue of a change in the mating type locus itself, resulting in loss of ability to mate.
