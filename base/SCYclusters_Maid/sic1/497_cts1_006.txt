isolation and characterization of two chitinase encoding genes (cts, cts) from the fungus coccidioides immitis.. . two chitinase (cts) encoding genes (cts) from coccidioides immitis (ci), a respiratory fungal pathogen of humans, were cloned and sequenced. both the genomic and cdna sequences are presented. the transcription start points and poly(a) addition sites were confirmed. the cts gene contains five introns and a bp orf which translates a amino acid (aa) protein of . kda. the cts gene contains two introns and a bp orf which translates a aa protein of . kda. the deduced cts protein showed highest homology to the aphanocladium album and trichoderma harzianum cts (% and %, respectively), while cts showed highest homology to the cts of saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc) and candida albicans (% and %, respectively). the putative n terminal sequence of the mature cts protein also showed % homology to the reported n terminal sequence of a kda complement fixation antigen (cf ag) of ci which has demonstrated chitinase activity. the cf ag is a clinically important antigen used in serodiagnosis of this fungal disease. cts showed several of the conserved features of the sc cts, including putative catalytic and ser/thr rich domains, and a c terminal cys rich region. we propose that cts and cts of ci are members of two distinct classes of fungal chitinases, an observation not previously reported for a single fungus.
