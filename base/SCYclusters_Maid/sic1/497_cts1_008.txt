involvement of the sin global transcriptional regulator in the chromatin structure of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have cloned and sequenced the sin gene and determined that sin is identical to tsf, identified as a negative regulator of gal gene transcription (s. chen, r.w. west, jr., s.l. johnson, h. gans, and j. ma, submitted for publication). yeast strains bearing a sin delta null mutation have been constructed and are temperature sensitive for growth and display defects in both negative and positive regulation of transcription. transcription of the cts gene is reduced in sin delta mutants, suggesting that sin functions as a positive transcriptional regulator. additionally, a sin lexa fusion protein activates transcription from test promoters containing lexa binding sites. the sin delta mutant also shows phenotypes common to histone and spt mutants, including suppression of delta insertion mutations in the his and lys promoters, expression of promoters lacking upstream activation sequence elements, and decreased superhelical density of circular dna molecules. these results suggest that the sin delta mutation may alter the structure of chromatin, and these changes in chromatin structure may affect transcriptional regulation.
