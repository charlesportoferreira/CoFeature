asymmetric sorting of ashp in yeast results from inhibition of translation by localization elements in the mrna.. . ash mrna localizes at the bud tip of late anaphase yeast, resulting in accumulation of ashp in the daughter nucleus. we show that disruption of the secondary structure, but not the protein coding, of all four ash localization elements resulted in rna and protein delocalization. localization of both was incrementally restored by replacement of each of the four elements. however, transposition of the elements to the 'utr reinstated the rna, but not the protein, localization. interestingly, the mutant ash mrna was translated more efficiently, suggesting that asymmetry of ashp resulted from translational inhibition by the localization elements. in support of this, ashp asymmetry could be rescued by slowing its translation.
