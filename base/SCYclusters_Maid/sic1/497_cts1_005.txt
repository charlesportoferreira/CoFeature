molecular cloning and characterization of chitinase genes from candida albicans.. . chitinase (ec ...) is an important enzyme for the remodeling of chitin in the cell wall of fungi. we have cloned three chitinase genes (cht, cht, and cht) from the dimorphic human pathogen candida albicans. cht and cht have been sequenced in full and their primary structures have been analyzed. cht encodes a protein of aa with a predicted size of . kda; cht encodes a protein of aa with a predicted size of kda. all three genes show striking similarity to other chitinase genes in the literature, especially in the proposed catalytic domain. transcription of cht and cht was greater when c. albicans was grown in a yeast phase as compared to a mycelial phase. a transcript of cht could not be detected in either growth condition.
