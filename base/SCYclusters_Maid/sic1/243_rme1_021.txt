activation of meiosis and sporulation by repression of the rme product in yeast.. . the ability of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to enter meiosis and sporulate is conferred by the a alpha regulatory activity of the mating type locus. we have cloned the rme gene and show that. the rme transcript is repressed by a alpha in a/alpha cells; overexpression of the rme product in a/alpha cells blocks sporulation; and inactivation of rme by a null mutation constructed in vitro permits cells lacking a alpha activity to sporulate. the rme product thus inhibits meiosis; the mating type locus permits entry into meiosis by repression of rme.
