grr functions in the ubiquitin pathway in saccharomyces cerevisiae through association with skp.. . cdc, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme in saccharomyces cerevisiae, is required for cell cycle progression. sic, an s phase cyclin dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, is a critical target of cdc mediated ubiquitination. other essential target protein(s) could be defined since cdc sic double mutants still arrest in g phase. to identify proteins which function in the cdc dependent ubiquitin pathway, a series of extragenic suppressors of the cdc sic double mutations was isolated. one of them was found to be defective in grr, which is involved not only in glucose repression but also in g cyclin destabilization. however, neither lack of glucose repression nor stabilization of g cyclin caused the suppression of cdc sic. conversely, grr overproduction in cdc sic cells impaired colony formation, even at the permissive temperature. a multicopy suppressor, mgo, which rescued the growth defect associated with grr overproduction was isolated, and found to be identical to skp. furthermore, grr bound skp directly in vitro. these results strongly suggest that grr functions in the ubiquitin pathway through association with skp.
