isolation of a chitin synthase gene (chs) from candida albicans by expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . chitin synthase activity was studied in yeast and hyphal forms of candida albicans. ph activity profiles showed that yeast and hyphae contain a protease dependent activity that has an optimum at ph .. in addition, there is an activity that is not activated by proteolysis in vitro and which shows a peak at ph .. this suggests there are two distinct chitin synthases in c. albicans. a gene for chitin synthase from c. albicans (chs) was cloned by heterologous expression in a saccharomyces cerevisiae chs mutant. proof that the cloned chitin synthase is a c. albicans membrane bound zymogen capable of chitin biosynthesis in vitro was based on several criteria. (i) the chs gene complemented the s. cerevisiae chs mutation and encoded enzymatic activity which was stimulated by partial proteolysis; (ii) the enzyme catalyses incorporation of [c] glcnac from the substrate, udp[u c] glcnac, into alkali insoluble chitin; (iii) southern analysis showed hybridization of a c. albicans chs probe only with c. albicans dna and not with s. cerevisiae dna; (iv) ph profiles of the cloned enzyme showed an optimum at ph .. this overlaps with the ph activity profiles for chitin synthase measured in yeast and hyphal forms of c. albicans. thus, chs encodes only part of the chitin synthase activity in c. albicans. a gene for a second chitin synthase in c. albicans with a ph optimum at . is proposed. dna sequencing revealed an open reading frame of nucleotides which predicts a polypeptide of mr , with amino acids. the alignment of derived amino acid sequences revealed that the chs gene from c. albicans (canchs) is homologous (% amino acid identity) to the chs gene from s. cerevisiae (sacchs).
