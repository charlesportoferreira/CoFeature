activation of the kss invasive filamentous growth pathway induces ty transcription and retrotransposition in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . using a set of genomic tya lacz fusions, we show that ste and tec, two transcription factors of the kss mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) cascade activate ty transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae. this result strongly suggests that the invasive filamentous pathway regulates ty transcription. since this pathway is active in diploid cells, we suspected that ty transposition might occur in this cell type, despite the fact that this event has been never reported before (unless activated by heterologous promoters such as that of gal). we demonstrate here that constitutive activation of the invasive filamentous pathway by the ste allele or by growth in low nitrogen medium induces ty transcription and retrotransposition in diploid cells. we show that ty retrotransposition can be activated by ste in haploid cells as well. our findings provide the first evidence that ty retrotransposition can be activated by environmental signals that affect differentiation. activation of the kss mapk cascade by stress is known to cause filament formation that permits the search for nutrients away from the colonization site. we propose that activation of ty retrotransposition by this cascade could play a role in adaptive mutagenesis in response to stress.
