pirp mediates translocation of the yeast apnp endonuclease into the mitochondria to maintain genomic stability.. . the mitochondrial genome is continuously subject to attack by reactive oxygen species generated through aerobic metabolism. this leads to the formation of a variety of highly genotoxic dna lesions, including abasic sites. yeast apnp is localized to the nucleus, where it functions to cleave abasic sites, and apn delta mutants are hypersensitive to agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (mms) that induce abasic sites. here we demonstrate for the first time that yeast apnp is also localized to the mitochondria. we found that pirp, initially isolated as a cell wall constituent of unknown function, interacts with the c terminal end of apnp, which bears a bipartite nuclear localization signal. further analysis revealed that pirp is required to cause apnp mitochondrial localization, presumably by competing with the nuclear transport machinery. pir delta mutants displayed a striking (approximately fold) increase of apnp in the nucleus, which coincided with drastically reduced levels in the mitochondria. to explore the functional consequences of the apnp pirp interaction, we measured the rate of mitochondrial mutations in the wild type and pir delta and apn delta mutants. pir delta and apn delta mutants exposed to mms exhibited . and . fold increases, respectively, in the rate of mitochondrial mutations, underscoring the importance of apnp in repair of the mitochondrial genome. we conclude that pirp interacts with apnp, at the level of either the cytoplasm or nucleus, and facilitates apnp transport into the mitochondria to repair damaged dna.
