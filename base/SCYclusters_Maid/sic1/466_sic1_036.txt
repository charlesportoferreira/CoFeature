functional interaction of yeast scf complexes with a set of yeast e enzymes in vitro.. . scf complexes are multi subunit ubiquitin ligases that, in concert with the e and e ubiquitination enzymes, catalyze the ubiquination of specific target proteins. only three yeast scfs have been reconstituted and characterized to date; each of these ubiquitinates its target protein with the e cdc. we have reconstituted and purified known and novel yeast scf complexes, and explored the ability of these complexes to function with different purified e enzymes; ubc, cdc, ubc, ubc and ubc. we have found that the ubiquitination of sic by the reconstituted scf(cdc) complex was specifically catalyzed by two of the five e enzymes tested in vitro; cdc and ubc. we also show that at least eight of the purified scf complexes clearly ubiquitinated their f box proteins in vitro, lending support for a regulatory mechanism in which f box proteins catalyze their own destruction. the autoubiquitination of each f box was in some cases catalyzed only by cdc, and in other cases preferentially catalyzed by ubc. ubc thus interacts with multiple scfs in vitro, and the interactions among scf and e components of the ubiquitination machinery may allow further diversification of the roles of scfs in vivo. copyright wiley liss, inc.
