dna binding of cpf is required for optimal centromere function but not for maintaining methionine prototrophy in yeast.. . the centromere and promoter factor (cpf) binds specifically in vitro and in vivo to an octanucleotide (rtcacrtg). this sequence is found in the centromere dna element i (cdei) of yeast centromeres and upstream from a number of transcription units including met, gal and trp. inactivation of the cpf gene results in three phenotypes; slow growth, a partial loss of centromere function and methionine auxotrophy. these phenotypes correlate well with the known binding sites for cpf and have led to the suggestion that cpf functions as a kinetochore protein at centromeres and as a transcriptional activator at promoters such as met. by analysing transcription from the met, gal, and trp genes in cpf strains, we demonstrate that cpf plays no direct role in their transcriptional regulation. further evidence in support of this comes from the analysis of point mutations in the basic region of cpf that affect dna binding. a strain expressing a non dna bound form of cpf is phenotypically met+, shows normal growth rate but has sub optimal centromere function. we conclude that a dna bound form of cpf is required for the kinetochore function but not for maintaining methionine prototrophy.
