a nuclear mutation reversing a biased transmission of yeast mitochondrial dna.. . the highly biased transmission of p mitochondrial dna that occurs in hypersuppressive matings between p and p+ cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is thought to be a consequence of the replication advantage of the p mtdna. a nuclear gene, mgt, that is required for this displacement of p+ mtdna from zygotic clones has been identified through mutation. when one haploid parent carries the mgt allele, transmission of p mtdna is substantially reduced. when both haploid parents carry the mgt allele, p mtdna is essentially eliminated from the zygotic progeny. thus in the absence of the mgt gene there is a switch in the transmission bias; p+ mtdna rather than the hypersuppressive p mtdna is inherited by most zygotic clones. in contrast to its semi dominant behavior in haploid matings, mgt behaves as a recessive allele in diploid matings since the p+ genome in mgt/mgt diploids is efficiently displaced when mated with a mgt/mgt hypersuppressive p diploid strain. we find that p+ genomes can be comaintained along with hypersuppressive p mtdna for extended periods in clonal lines derived from mgt x mgt matings. however, as expected from the recessive nature of the mgt mutation, these p+ genomes are eventually eliminated. our work indicates that mgt plays a crucial role in the competition for inheritance between hypersuppressive p mtdnas and the p+ mitochondrial genome. the mgt gene product may be a component of a mtdna replication system that acts preferentially at the rep sequences found in hypersuppressive mtdnas.
