glutathione regulates the expression of gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase via the met transcription factor.. . our previous studies have shown that glutathione is an essential metabolite in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae because a mutant deleted for gsh, encoding the first enzyme in gamma l glutamyl l cysteinylglycine (gsh) biosynthesis, cannot grow in its absence. in contrast, strains deleted for gsh, encoding the second step in gsh synthesis, grow poorly as the dipeptide intermediate, gamma glutamylcysteine, can partially substitute for gsh. in this present study, we identify two high copy suppressors that rescue the poor growth of the gsh mutant in the absence of gsh. the first contains gsh, indicating that gamma glutamylcysteine can functionally replace gsh if it is present in sufficiently high quantities. the second contains cdc, encoding a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, indicating a link between the ubiquitin and gsh stress protective systems. we show that cdc rescues the growth of the gsh mutant by inducing the met dependent expression of gsh and elevating the cellular levels of gamma glutamylcysteine. furthermore, this mechanism normally operates to regulate gsh biosynthesis in the cell, as gsh promoter activity is induced in a met dependent manner in a gsh mutant which is devoid of gsh, and the addition of exogenous gsh represses gsh expression. analysis of a cis mutant, which cannot breakdown gsh, confirmed that gsh and not a metabolic product, serves as the regulatory molecule. however, this is not a general mechanism affecting all met regulated genes, as met expression is unaffected in a gsh mutant, and gsh acts as a poor repressor of met expression compared with methionine. in summary, gsh biosynthesis is regulated in parallel with sulphate assimilation by activity of the met protein, but gsh specific mechanisms exist that respond to gsh availability.
