production, purification, and luminometric analysis of recombinant saccharomyces cerevisiae met adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase expressed in escherichia coli.. . atp sulfurylase cdna from met on chromosome x of saccharomyces cerevisiae was amplified and cloned, and recombinant atp sulfurylase was expressed in escherichia coli. the synthesis of atp sulfurylase was directed by an expression system that employs the regulatory genes of the luminous bacterium vibrio fischeri. a soluble, biologically active form was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from lysates of recombinant e. coli by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. the specific activity of the purified enzyme was estimated to u/mg. the apparent molecular mass of the recombinant enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be kda, which indicates that the active enzyme is an octamer of identical subunits (the molecular mass of a single subunit is . kda). the atp sulfurylase activity was monitored in real time by a very sensitive bioluminometric method. copyright academic press.
