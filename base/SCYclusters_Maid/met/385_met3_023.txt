tdh is linked to met on chromosome x of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the met gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae was cloned and its restriction map was found to differ in the upstream region from an earlier published map (cherest et al. gene , , ) and nucleotide sequence (cherest et al. mol. gen. genet. , , ). southern blot analysis of genomic dna from strains sc and fl (the genetic backgrounds from which these different copies of the gene had been cloned) showed that our clone from a sc based library had the same restriction map as the chromosomal dna from both of the strains. comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the two clones indicated that the earlier published clone probably represented a cloning artifact. in our clone, we found upstream of met, the nucleotide sequence of the tdh gene (holland and holland, j. biol. chem. , , ). the chromosomal orientation of the two genes was determined to be met tdh cen.
