dna sequencing and analysis of a . kb segment encompassing centromere cen of saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals nine previously unknown open reading frames.. . a . kb segment of the cosmid clone pukg containing a sauai partial fragment from the centromere region of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome xi was sequenced and analysed. a mixed strategy of directed methods including exonuclease iii nested deletion, restriction fragment subcloning and oligonucleotide directed sequences was carried out. exclusive use was made of the applied biosystems taq dyedeoxy terminator cycle technology and a laser based aba sequencing system for reactions, gel electrophoresis and automated reading. a total of open reading frames (orfs) was found. nine new orfs (yk to yk) were identified, three of which (yk, yk, yk) showed homologies to proteins of known function from other organisms. in addition, sequence analysis revealed three recently functionally characterized genes (met, vps/spo, pap), which could be joined to the earlier published cen region.
