occurrence of low molecular weight o acetylserine sulfhydrylase in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . studies with crude preparations obtained from a cysteine auxotroph of saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that o acetylserine sulfhydrylase could be separated from o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase by chromatography on a deae cellulose column and centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. on the basis of sedimentation distance, the molecular weights of these enzymes were calculated to be about , and ,, respectively. the former did not react with the amino acid substrate of the latter, and vice versa. the wild type strain was also demonstrated to possess o acetylserine sulfhydrylase (molecular weight. about ,), in addition to a large amount of o acetylserine o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase (yamagata et al. () j. biochem. , ).
