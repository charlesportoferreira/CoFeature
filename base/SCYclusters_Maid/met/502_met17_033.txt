regulation of cystathionine gamma lyase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . regulation of the two enzymes in reverse trans sulfuration was investigated in saccharomyces cerevisiae. in wild type strains, cystathionine gamma lyase, but not cystathionine beta synthase, was depressed nearly fold if cells were starved for both inorganic and organic sulfur compounds. in a met strain which is defective of o acetylserine and o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase, the same enzyme was derepressed if organic sulfur compounds were limited; the repressive effect was in the order of glutathione greater than methionine greater than cysteine. the repressive effect of methionine was not observed, however, in a cys cys strain which is deficient of serine o acetyltransferase and cystathionine beta synthase, indicating that methionine itself is not the effector. the weak repressive effect of cysteine was attributed to inefficient uptake of this amino acid. our observations indicate that cystathionine gamma lyase is the target of regulation in reverse trans sulfuration and that cysteine is very likely to be the effector of this regulation.
