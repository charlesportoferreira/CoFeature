the pyc plasmids, a series of cassette based yeast plasmid vectors providing means of counter selection.. . a series of general purpose yeast plasmid vectors has been constructed. the plasmid series is composed of inter replaceable cassettes, allowing for easy interconversion of plasmid types. in addition to the usual replication origins, selectable markers and multiple cloning sites (mcs), cassettes dedicated to counter selection have been constructed. a pair of unique bp restriction enzyme recognition sites flank each type of cassette, fsei in the case of yeast replication origins, asci in the case of selectable markers, paci in the case of counter selectable markers and noti in the case of the mcs. thus, any given cassette can be replaced by another cassette of the same type, facilitating interconversion of any given plasmid from one type to another, even after the insertion of dna into the mcs. hence, the plasmids have been named pyc for 'yeast cassettes'. the cassettes consist of either none, cen/ars or micro as replication origin, either ura, met ca (lg met) or the g resistance gene (the apt gene from bacterial transposon tn, encoding aminoglycoside phosphotransferase) as selectable markers, either none, pmet pka or pcha pka as counter selectable marker, and the mcs, containing recognition sites for aflii, avrii, bspei, pmei, sacii, sali, suni, bamhi, ecori, hindiii, kpni, mlui, nari and saci (of which the seven first are unique in all plasmids). the counter selectable markers consist of the pka gene under control of the conditional met or cha promoters. at activating conditions these promoters express the pka gene at toxic levels, facilitating easy selection for loss of plasmid or 'loop out' of plasmid dna sequence after genomic integration. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
