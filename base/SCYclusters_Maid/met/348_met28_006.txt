yap, a novel family of eight bzip proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae with distinct biological functions.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae contains eight members of a novel and fungus specific family of bzip proteins that is defined by four atypical residues on the dna binding surface. two of these proteins, yap and yap, are transcriptional activators involved in pleiotropic drug resistance. although initially described as ap factors, at least four yap proteins bind most efficiently to ttactaa, a sequence that differs at position +/ from the optimal ap site (tgactca); further, a yap like derivative of the ap factor gcn (aq sf) binds efficiently to the yap recognition sequence. molecular modeling suggests that the yap specific residues make novel contacts and cause physical constraints at the +/ position that may account for the distinct dna binding specificities of yap and ap proteins. to various extents, yap, yap, yap, and yap activate transcription from a promoter containing a yap recognition site. yap dependent transcription is abolished in strains containing high levels of protein kinase a; in contrast, gcn transcriptional activity is stimulated by protein kinase a. interestingly, yap transcriptional activity is stimulated by hydrogen peroxide, whereas yap activity is stimulated by aminotriazole and cadmium. in addition, unlike other yap mutations tested, yap (cin) mutations affect chromosome stability, and they suppress the cold sensitive phenotype of yap mutant strains. thus, members of the yap family carry out overlapping but distinct biological functions.
