role of hydrosulfide ions (hs ) in methylmercury resistance in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . methylmercury resistant mutants were obtained from saccharomyces cerevisiae. they were divided into two complementation groups, met (homoserine o acetyltransferase deficiency) and met (enzyme deficiency unknown), as reported previously. it was found that met was allelic to met (o acetylserine and o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase deficiency). methylmercury toxicity was counteracted by exogenously added hs , and both met and met (met) mutants overproduced hs. on the basis of these results, we conclude that met and met (met) cause accumulation of hydrosulfide ions in the cell and that the increased level of hydrosulfide is responsible for detoxification of methylmercury.
