molecular and genetic analysis of the cryptococcus neoformans met gene and a met mutant.. . the cryptococcus neoformans met cdna (encoding atp sulfurylase) was cloned by complementation of the corresponding met mutation in saccharomyces cerevisiae. sequence analysis showed high similarity between the deduced amino acid sequence of the c. neoformans metp and other fungal atp sulfurylases. a c. neoformans met mutant was made by targeted insertional mutagenesis, which had the expected auxotrophic phenotype, and reconstituted the met mutant to met(+). in vitro, the c. neoformans met mutant had a substantial defect in melanin formation, significantly reduced growth rate, and greatly increased thermotolerance. in the murine inhalation infection model, the met mutant was avirulent and was deficient in its ability to survive in mice. it is concluded that, in contrast to the yeast form of histoplasma capsulatum, in c. neoformans the sulfate assimilation arm of the methionine biosynthetic pathway plays an important role in vitro, even in the presence of abundant exogenous methionine, and is critical for virulence, and indeed for survival, in vivo.
