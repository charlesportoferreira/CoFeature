utilization by saccharomyces cerevisiae of ' methylthioadenosine as a source of both purine and methionine.. . cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae are normally impermeable to the purine nucleosides adenosine and ' deoxy ' methylthioadenosine (mta), a product of polyamine biosynthesis. cordycepin sensitive, adenosine utilizing strains of s. cerevisiae were able to use mta to fulfill an auxotrophic requirement for purine. cordycepin sensitive strains carrying a met mutation were also able to use mta as a source of methionine. these mta utilizing strains of s. cerevisiae should be useful for metabolic studies of the fate of mta.
