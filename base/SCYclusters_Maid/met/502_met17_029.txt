cystathionine gamma lyase of saccharomyces cerevisiae. structural gene and cystathionine gamma synthase activity.. . purification of saccharomyces cerevisiae cystathionine gamma lyase (gamma ctlase) was hampered by the presence of a protein migrating very close to it in various types of column chromatography. the enzyme and the contaminant were nevertheless separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. n terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicated that they are coded for by cys (cyi) and met (met), respectively, leading to the conclusion that cys is the structural gene for gamma ctlase and that the contaminant is o acetylserine/o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase (oas/oah shlase). based on these findings, we purified gamma ctlase by the following strategy. () extraction of oas/oah shlase from a cys disrupted strain; () preparation of antiserum against it; () identification of a strain devoid of the oas/oah shlase protein using this antiserum; and () extraction of gamma ctlase from this strain. purified gamma ctlase had cystathionine gamma synthase (gamma ctsase) activity if o succinylhomoserine, but not o acetylhomoserine, was used as substrate. from this notion we discuss the evolutional relationship between s. cerevisiae gamma ctlase and escherichia coli gamma ctsase.
