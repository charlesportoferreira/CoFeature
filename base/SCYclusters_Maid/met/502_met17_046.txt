genetic and physiological characterization of met mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae. a selective system for forward and reverse mutations.. . one hundred and thirty three spontaneous and induced mutants of the met locus in saccharomyces cerevisiae were characterized with respect to temperature sensitivity, osmotic remediability, interallelic complementation, and suppressibility by amber and ochre suppressors. forty mutants are osmotic remedial; of these, and no others, are also temperature sensitive. seven of mutations are suppressible by an amber suppressor and are suppressible by an ochre suppressor. seventy percent of the mutants exhibited interallelic complementation, suggesting that the functional gene product of the met gene is a multimeric protein. relative map positions of met were estimated from the frequencies of x ray induced mitotic reversion of various heteroallelic diploids. all complementing nonsense mutations are located near one end of the gene in contrast to other nonsense mutations which span most of the gene, thus relating the direction of translation of the mrna with respect to the fine structure map. recombination studies indicated that two of mutants contained deletions of the entire met locus. it was established that a variety of mutational types, including missense, nonsense, and deletions, are recovered with this unique system in which both forward and reverse mutations can be selected on the basis of methyl mercury resistance and methionine requirement of the met mutants.
