a mutator affecting the region of the iso cytochrome c gene in yeast.. . the mutator gene del in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a high rate of formation of multisite mutations that encompass the following three adjacent genes. cyc, which determines the structure of iso cytochrome c; rad, which controls uv sensitivity; and osm, which controls osomotic sensitivity. the simplest hypothesis is that these multisite mutations are deletions, although it has not been excluded that they may involve other types of gross chromosomal aberrations. in contrast, normal strains do not produce such multisite mutations even after mutagenic treatments. the multisite mutations arise at a rate of approximately ( ) to ( ) per cell per division in del strains, which is much higher than rates observed for mutation of genes in normal strains. for example, normal strains produce all types of cyc mutants at a low rate of approximately ( ) to ( ). no evidence for multisite mutations was obtained upon analysis of numerous spontaneous ade, ade, met and met mutants isolated in a del strain. del appears to be both cis and trans dominant. the location of the del gene and the lack of effect on other genes suggest that the mutator acts only on a region adjacent to itself.
