a useful colony colour phenotype associated with the yeast selectable/counter selectable marker met.. . strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae bearing null alleles of the met gene are methionine auxotrophs and become darkly pigmented in the presence of pb+ ions (ono et al. (). appl. env. microbiol. , ). we describe the cloning of a useful fragment of the met locus which complements both the methionine requirement and the colony colour phenotype. this colony colour phenotype is very useful for genetic screens and may be applicable for use in other yeast species. the combination of the size of met, along with its counter selectability and the colour of met mutations make this perhaps the most versatile yeast genetic marker.
