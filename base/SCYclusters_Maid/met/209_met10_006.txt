antifungal azoxybacilin exhibits activity by inhibiting gene expression of sulfite reductase.. . azoxybacilin, produced by bacillus cereus, has a broad spectrum of antifungal activity in methionine free medium and has been suggested to inhibit sulfite fixation. we have further investigated the mode of action by which azoxybacilin kills fungi. the compound inhibited the incorporation of [s] sulfate into acid insoluble fractions of saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions in which virtually no inhibition was observed for dna, rna, or protein synthesis. it did not interfere with the activity of the enzymes for sulfate assimilation but clearly inhibited the induction of those enzymes when s. cerevisiae cells were transferred from rich medium to a synthetic methionine free medium. particularly strong inhibition was observed in the induction of sulfite reductase. northern (rna) analysis revealed that azoxybacilin decreased the level of mrna of genes for sulfate assimilation, including met for sulfite reductase and met, the transactivator of met and other sulfate assimilation genes. when activities of azoxybacilin were compared for mrna and enzyme syntheses from met, the concentration required for inhibition of transcription of the gene was about times higher (% inhibitory concentration = micrograms/ml) than that required for inhibition of induction of enzyme synthesis (% inhibitory concentration = micrograms/ml). the data suggest that azoxybacilin acts on at least two steps in the expression of sulfite reductase; the transcriptional activation of met and a posttranscriptional regulation in met expression. we conclude that azoxybacilin exhibits antifungal activity by interfering with the regulation of expression of sulfite reductase activity.
