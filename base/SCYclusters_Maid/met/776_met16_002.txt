methylation of histone h k mediates association of the iswp atpase with chromatin.. . setp methylates lysine (k) of histone h and regulates the expression of many genes in yeast. here we use a biochemical approach to identify a protein, iswp, which recognizes chromatin preferentially when it is di and trimethylated at k h. we show that on certain actively transcribed genes, the iswp chromatin remodeling atpase requires k h methylation to associate with chromatin in vivo. analysis of one such gene, met, shows that the enzymatic activities of setp and iswp are functionally connected. setp methylation and iswp atpase generate specific chromatin changes at the ' end of the gene, are necessary for the correct distribution of rna polymerase ii over the coding region, and are required for the recruitment of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor rnap. these results indicate that k h methylation and iswp atpase activity are intimately linked in regulating transcription of certain genes in yeast.
