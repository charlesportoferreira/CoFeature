cloning of a cdna encoding atp sulfurylase from arabidopsis thaliana by functional expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . atp sulfurylase, the first enzyme in the sulfate assimilation pathway of plants, catalyzes the formation of adenosine phosphosulfate from atp and sulfate. here we report the cloning of a cdna encoding atp sulfurylase (aps) from arabidopsis thaliana. aps was isolated by its ability to alleviate the methionine requirement of an atp sulfurylase mutant strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). expression of aps correlated with the presence of atp sulfurylase enzyme activity in cell extracts. aps is a bp cdna with an open reading frame predicted to encode a amino acid, , d protein. the predicted amino acid sequence of aps is similar to atp sulfurylase of s. cerevisiae, with which it is % identical. two lines of evidence indicate that aps encodes a chloroplast form of atp sulfurylase. its predicted amino terminal sequence resembles a chloroplast transit peptide; and the aps polypeptide, synthesized in vitro, is capable of entering isolated intact chloroplasts. several genomic dna fragments that hybridize with the aps probe were identified. the aps cdna hybridizes to three species of mrna in leaves (., ., and . kb) and to a single species of mrna in roots (. kb).
