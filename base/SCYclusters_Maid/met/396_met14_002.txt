a new yeast gene with a myosin like heptad repeat structure.. . we isolated a gene encoding a kda myosin like protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae using a monoclonal antibody directed against human platelet myosin as a probe. the protein sequence encoded by the mlp gene (for myosin like protein) contains extensive stretches of a heptad repeat pattern suggesting that the protein can form coiled coils typical of myosins. immunolocalization experiments using affinity purified antibodies raised against a trpe mlp fusion protein showed a dot like structure adjacent to the nucleus in yeast cells bearing the mlp gene on a multicopy plasmid. in mouse epithelial cells the yeast anti mlp antibodies stained the nucleus. mutants bearing disruptions of the mlp gene were viable, but more sensitive to ultraviolet light than wild type strains, suggesting an involvement of mlp in dna repair. the mlp gene was mapped to chromosome , cm from met.
