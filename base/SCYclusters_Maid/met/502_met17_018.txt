single point mutations in metp impair the transcriptional repression of met genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . transcription of met genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on a transcriptional activator, the met gene product (metp). using in vitro mutagenesis, we isolated two mutant met alleles encoding [pro]metp and [ser]metp. these mutations impeded metp's responsiveness to methionine in the media, and yeast cells carrying mutant alleles exhibited enhanced transcription of met genes under repressing conditions. the enhanced transcription was dependent on the cbf gene, but did not compete with an excess of wild type metp, suggesting that some changes in the affinity of metp to other factors might be involved in s adenosylmethionine mediated transcriptional regulation.
