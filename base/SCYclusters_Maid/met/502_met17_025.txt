physical localization of yeast cys, a gene whose product resembles the rat gamma cystathionase and escherichia coli cystathionine gamma synthase enzymes.. . we have cloned, sequenced and physically mapped the cys gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. this gene can complement the cys allele, and disruptions at this locus lead to cysteine auxotrophy. the predicted cys product is closely related (% identical) to the rat cystathionine gamma lyase (erickson et al., ), but differs in lacking cysteine residues. these results provide further evidence that the sc strain of yeast resembles mammals in synthesizing cysteine solely via a trans sulfuration pathway. the cys product was found to have strong homology to three other enzymes involved in cysteine metabolism. the escherichia coli metb and metc products and the s. cerevisiae met gene product. the trans sulfuration enzymes appear to form a diverged family and carry out related functions from bacteria to mammals.
