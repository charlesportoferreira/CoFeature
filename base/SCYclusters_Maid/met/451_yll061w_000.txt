functional analysis of six novel orfs on the left arm of chromosome xii of saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals three of them responding to s starvation.. . six novel open reading frames (orfs) located on the left arm of the chromosome xii (yllw, yllc, yllc, yllw, yllc and yllc) have been analysed using either short flanking homology (sfh) or long flanking homology (lfh) gene replacement. sporulation and tetrad analysis showed none of these orfs to be essential for vegetative growth. the standard eurofan growth tests failed to reveal any obvious phenotypes resulting from deletion of each of the orfs. bioinformatic analysis revealed that yllw is probably an amino acid permease for s methylmethionine and that yllc encodes a glutathione transferase which is involved in cellular detoxification, while yllw may play a role in sulphur containing amino acid metabolism, yllc in sulphonate catabolism and yllc in stress response. the transcription of three orfs (yllw, yllc and yllc) has been shown to increase more than fold under sulphate starvation. replacement cassettes, comprising the kanmx marker flanked by each orf's promoter and terminator regions, were cloned into pug. all the cognate clones, were generated using direct pcr products amplified from genomic dna or using gap repair. all clones and strains produced have been deposited in the eurofan genetic stock centre (euroscarf, frankfurt). copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
