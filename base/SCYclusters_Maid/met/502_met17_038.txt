molecular genetics of met and met mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae. intragenic complementation between mutations of a single structural gene.. . we cloned the met gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae by functional complementation after transformation of a yeast met mutant. restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing of the met clones revealed that these were from the same genomic region as clones isolated previously and shown to contain the met gene encoding the enzyme o acetylhomoserine, o acetylserine sulphydrylase (oah oas sulphydrylase). transformation studies with met clones showed that the met and met functions were both endoced in a single transcription unit. we conclude that met and met are both mutations in the structural gene for the oah oas sulphydrylase subunit and that each affects a different functional domain of the enzyme allowing subunit complementation in the met x met diploid. enzyme assays indicated that the diploid, although not requiring methionine, had a low oah oas sulphydrylase activity (% of wild type). this is consistent with met and met being the same gene. we found that both met and met mutants were devoid of ' phospho adenosine ' phospho sulphite (paps) reductase activity and that this activity was fully restored in the met x met diploid. the possible interactions between oah oas sulphydrylase and paps reductase are discussed.
