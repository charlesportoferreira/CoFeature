molecular cloning and characterization of the met gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a yeast dna fragment complementing the met mutation in yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) was cloned in a shuttle vector, yep, by transforming a yeast host with plasmid dna prepared from yeast gene bank cv of k. nasmyth. a restriction map of a kb saua insert was constructed. a . kb fragment (saua bamhi) complementing the mutation was found by subcloning. evidence that the dna fragment contains the yeast met gene was obtained by genomic integration. a . kb transcript is found both in wild type (wt) and met yeast strains by northern blotting experiments, indicating that the mutation acts at posttranscriptional level. the rate of transcription for the integrant lies between the values observed for the wt and mutant strains. the functional gene product seems to be involved in negative regulation of transcription of the met gene.
