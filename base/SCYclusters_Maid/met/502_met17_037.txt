elements involved in s adenosylmethionine mediated regulation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae met gene.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the met gene encodes o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase. synthesis of this enzyme is repressed by the presence of s adenosylmethionine (adomet) in the growth medium. we identified cis elements required for met expression by analyzing small deletions in the met promoter region. the results revealed a regulatory region, acting as an upstream activation site, that activated transcription of met in the absence of methionine or adomet. we found that, for the most part, repression of met expression was due to a lack of activation at this site, reinforced by an independent repression mechanism. the activation region contained a repeated dyad sequence that is also found in the promoter regions of other unlinked but coordinately regulated genes (met, met, and sam). we show that the presence of the two dyads is necessary for maximal gene expression. moreover, we demonstrate that in addition to this transcriptional regulation, a posttranscriptional regulation, probably targeted at the ' region of mrna, is involved in met expression.
