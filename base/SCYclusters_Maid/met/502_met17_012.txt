structure and regulation of cysd, the homocysteine synthase gene of aspergillus nidulans.. . the a. nidulans cysd gene encoding homocysteine synthase (o acetyl l homoserine sulphydrylase) has been isolated by functional complementation of a cysd mutation. the gene contains five short introns and codes for a protein of amino acids. the protein shows homology with bacterial and yeast o acetyl and o succinyl homoserine sulphydrylases, particularly from schizosaccharomyces pombe, saccharomyces cerevisiae and kluyveromyces lactis. the cysd cdna is able to complement a s. cerevisiae mutation impairing homocysteine synthase. synthesis of the cysd mrna is down regulated by a high concentration of methionine in growth medium without sulphate and up regulated under sulphur limitation. a comparison of cysd genomic and cdna copies, derived from different a. nidulans strains, revealed a marked dna sequence polymorphism manifested mostly by silent point mutations. there was, however, much less polymorphism in the protein sequence.
