the role of saccharomyces cerevisiae metp and metp in sirohaem and cobalamin biosynthesis.. . met and met mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae can be complemented by salmonella typhimurium cysg, indicating that the genes are involved in the transformation of uroporphyrinogen iii into sirohaem. in the present study, we have demonstrated complementation of defined cysg mutants of sal. typhimurium and escherichia coli, with either met or met cloned in tandem with pseudomonas denitrificans coba. the conclusion drawn from these experiments is that met encodes the s adenosyl l methionine uroporphyrinogen iii transmethylase activity, and met encodes the dehydrogenase and chelatase activities (all three functions are encoded by sal. typhimurium and e. coli cysg). met was further cloned into petb to allow expression of the protein with an n terminal his tag. after purification, the functions of the his tagged metp were studied in vitro by assay with precorrin in the presence of nad+ and co+. the results demonstrated that metp acts as a dehydrogenase and chelatase in the biosynthesis of sirohaem. moreover, despite the fact that s. cerevisiae does not make cobalamins de novo, we have shown also that met is able to complement cobalamin cobaltochelatase mutants and have revealed a subtle difference in the early stages of the anaerobic cobalamin biosynthetic pathways between sal. typhimurium and bacillus megaterium.
