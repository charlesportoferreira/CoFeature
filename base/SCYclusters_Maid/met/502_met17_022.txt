sulfur amino acid metabolism in schizosaccharomyces pombe. occurrence of two o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases and the lack of the reverse transsulfuration pathway.. . the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe has a unique organization of sulfur amino acid metabolism. it has two distinct o acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases (homocysteine synthases). similar to enterobacteriaceae, s. pombe lacks cystathionine beta synthase and cystathionine gamma lyase the enzymes of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, by which methionine is readily metabolized to cysteine a likely effector in the sulfur metabolite repression system. consequently no repression of sulfate assimilation is observed when methionine is added to the growth medium.
