analysis of a . kb dna sequence of chromosome x reveals three trna genes and new open reading frames including a gene most probably belonging to the family of ubiquitin protein ligases.. . we have sequenced a , bp stretch located on chromosome x of saccharomyces cerevisiae between the genes met and cdc. this stretch contains open reading frames (orfs) of at least amino acids. ten of these correspond to previously published sequences, whereas of the remaining orfs, only one, gtd, has significant similarity to proteins from yeast or other organisms. it may belong to the family of ubiquitin protein ligases and be involved in the ubiquitin dependent proteolytic pathway. in addition, three trna genes were recognized, two of which had not been hitherto localized.
