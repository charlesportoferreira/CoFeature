molecular and catalytic properties of arabidopsis thaliana adenylyl sulfate (aps) kinase.. . a cdna clone (atakn) from arabidopsis thaliana encoding aps kinase (ec ...) was investigated for structural and catalytic properties of the gene product. recombinant his atakn formed paps at a vmax of . u x mg( ). the km for aps was . microm and for atp microm. aps caused a severe substrate inhibition (k(i) . microm). the type of inhibition is uncompetitive with respect to mgatp. high ionic strength and reducing thiols stabilized the enzyme activity. plant aps kinase is regulated in vitro by the redox charge with thioredoxin as essential activator. mutagenesis of a serine in sc and sf presumed to be involved in the transfer of the phosphoryl group had no effect upon catalytic activity. using a yeast two hybrid system with atakn as bait, an interacting clone was detected from a cdna library of a. thaliana cv. columbia that codes for an aps kinase iso form (atakn). complementation of aps kinase deficient saccharomyces cerevisiae met showed that atakn is functionally active as aps kinase. it was immunologically related to atakn and presumably represents a plastidal iso form of the plant aps kinase gene family. copyright academic press.
