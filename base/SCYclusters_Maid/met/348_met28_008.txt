a heteromeric complex containing the centromere binding factor and two basic leucine zipper factors, met and met, mediates the transcription activation of yeast sulfur metabolism.. . transcription activation of sulfur metabolism in yeast is dependent on two dna binding factors, the centromere binding factor (cbf) and met. while the role of met was clearly established by showing that it acts as a transcription activator, the precise function in transcription of the multi functional factor cbf remains more elusive. we report here the identification of a new transcription factor met which participates in the regulation of sulfur metabolism. cloning and sequencing of met revealed that it encodes a new member of the basic leucine zipper dna binding factor family. we also demonstrate that met possesses no intrinsic transcription activation capabilities. studies of the dna binding characteristics of met led us to identify in gel mobility assays a heteromeric complex containing cbf, met and met. we further demonstrated that the presence of cbf and met stimulates the binding of met to dna. 'two hybrid' studies allowed us to carry out preliminary investigations on the binary protein protein interactions involved in the formation of the cbf met met complex. our results give evidence that the leucine zippers of met and met, along with the basic helix loop helix domain of cbf, provide the protein surfaces mediating these interactions. all these results suggest that the multi functional factor cbf functions in transcription activation by tethering specific activating factors to the dna.
