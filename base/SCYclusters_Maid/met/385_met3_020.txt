the general amino acid control regulates met, which encodes a methionine pathway specific transcriptional activator of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a met mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae was unable to transcribe a number of genes encoding enzymes of the methionine biosynthetic pathway. the sequence of the cloned met gene allowed the previously sequenced flanking leu and pol genes to be linked to met into a , bp contiguous region of chromosome xiv. from the sequence and mapping of the transcriptional start points, met is predicted to encode a protein of amino acids (as opposed to amino acids published by others) with a leucine zipper domain at the c terminus, preceded by both acidic and basic regions. thus, met belongs to the family of basic leucine zipper trans activator proteins. disruption of met resulted in methionine auxotrophy with no other phenotype. transcriptional studies showed that met was regulated by the general amino acid control and hence by another bzip protein encoded by gcn. gcn binding sequences are present between the divergently transcribed met and leu genes. over expression of met resulted in leaky expression from the otherwise tightly regulated met promoter under its control. the presence of consensus sequences for other potential regulatory elements in the met promoter suggests a complex regulation of this gene.
