isolation and subcloning analysis of functional centromere dna (cen) from saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome xi.. . we have cloned segments of yeast dna containing the centromere xi linked met gene. this was done by selecting directly in saccharomyces cerevisiae for complementation of a met mutation after transformation with a hybrid plasmid dna genomic library. genetic evidence indicates that functional centromere dna (cen) from chromosome xi is also contained on the segment of s. cerevisiae dna cloned in pye(met). this plasmid is maintained stably in budding s. cerevisiae cultures and segregates predominantly +. through meiosis. the cen element has been subcloned in vector yrp' on an s. cerevisiae dna fragment base pairs in length [pye(cen)]. the mitotic and meiotic behavior of plasmids containing cen plus a dna replicator (ars) indicates that the centromere dna sequences enable these plasmids to function as true minichromosomes in s. cerevisiae.
