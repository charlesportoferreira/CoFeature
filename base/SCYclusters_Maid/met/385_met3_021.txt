methionine mediated lethality in yeast cells at elevated temperature.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae cells grown at degrees c in minimal medium containing methionine lose viability upon transfer to degrees c, whereas cells grown in the absence of methionine survive. cellular levels of two intermediates in the sulfate assimilation pathway, adenosine ' phosphosulfate (aps) and adenosine ' phosphosulfate ' phosphate, are increased by a posttranslational mechanism after sudden elevation of temperature in yeast cultures grown in the absence of methionine. yeast cells unable to synthesize aps because of repression by methionine or mutation of the met gene do not survive the temperature shift. thus, methionine mediated lethality at elevated temperature is linked to the inability to synthesize aps. the results demonstrate that aps plays an important role in thermotolerance.
