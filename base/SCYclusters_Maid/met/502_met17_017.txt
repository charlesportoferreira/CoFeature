regulation of sulphate assimilation in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we examined how the activity of o acetylserine and o acetylhomoserine sulphydrylase (oas/oah) shlase of saccharomyces cerevisiae is affected by sulphur source added to the growth medium and genetic background of the strain. in a wild type strain, the activity was repressed if methionine, cysteine or glutathione was added to the growth medium. however, in a strain deficient of cystathionine gamma lyase, cysteine and glutathione were repressive, but methionine was not. in strains deficient of serine o acetyltransferase (satase), oas/oah shlase activity was low regardless of sulphur source and was further lowered by cysteine and glutathione, but not by methionine. from these observations, we concluded that s adenosylmethionine should be excluded from being the effector for regulation of oas/oah shlase. instead, we suspected that s. cerevisiae would have the same regulatory system as escherichia coli for sulphate assimilation; i.e. cysteine inhibits satase to lower the cellular concentration of oas which is required for induction of the sulphate assimilation enzymes including oas/oah shlase. subsequently, we obtained data supporting this speculation.
