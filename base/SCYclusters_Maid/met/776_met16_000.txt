cbfp modulates chromatin structure, transcription and repair at the saccharomyces cerevisiae met locus.. . the presence of damage in the transcribed strand (ts) of active genes and its position in relation to nucleosomes influence nucleotide excision repair (ner) efficiency. we examined chromatin structure, transcription and repair at the met gene of wild type and cbfdelta saccharomyces cerevisiae cells under repressing or derepressing conditions. cbfp is a sequence specific dna binding protein required for met chromatin remodelling. irrespective of the level of transcription, repair at the mspi restriction fragment of met exhibits periodicity in line with nucleosome positions in both strands of the regulatory region and the non transcribed strand of the coding region. however, repair in the coding region of the ts is always faster, but exhibits periodicity only when met is repressed. in general, absence of cbfp decreased repair in the sequences examined, although the effects were more dramatic in the cbfp remodelled area, with repair being reduced to the lowest levels within the nucleosome cores of this region. our results indicate that repair at the promoter and coding regions of this lowly transcribed gene are dependent on both chromatin structure and the level of transcription. the data are discussed in light of current models relating ner and chromatin structure.
