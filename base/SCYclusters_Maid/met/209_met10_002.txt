ssu mediates sulphite efflux in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . ssup, a plasma membrane protein involved in sulphite metabolism in saccharomyces cerevisiae, was found to be required for efficient sulphite efflux. an ssu null mutant accumulated significantly more sulphite than wild type, whereas cells expressing multicopy ssu accumulated significantly less. cells expressing fzf , a dominant allele of a transcriptional activator of ssu that confers sulphite resistance, also accumulated less sulphite. beta galactosidase activity in the fzf strain carrying an ssu.lacz fusion was found to be . fold higher than in a strain carrying wild type fzf, confirming that the heightened resistance was correlated with hyperactivation of ssu. multicopy ssu was also found to increase the sulphite resistance of a number of unrelated sulphite sensitive strains by a factor of to fold. rates of efflux of free sulphite from cells expressing multicopy ssu or fzf were significantly greater than that from wild type or from a ssu null mutant. rates of efflux of bound sulphite from wild type, a ssu null mutant, a fzf mutant, or cells expressing multicopy ssu were not significantly different, suggesting that ssup specifically mediates efflux of the free form of sulphite. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
