functional analysis of the sporulation specific spr gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the spr gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a moderately abundant rna that is present at high levels only during sporulation. the gene contains a long open reading frame that could encode a hydrophilic protein approximately kda in size. this protein is probably produced by the yeast, because the lacz gene of escherichia coli is expressed during sporulation when fused to spr in the expected reading frame. spr is inessential for sporulation; mutants that lack spr activity sporulate normally and produce viable ascospores. nonetheless, the spr gene encodes a function that is relevant to sporulating cells; the wild type allele can enhance sporulation in strains that are defective for several spr functions. spr is located on chromosome v, . centimorgans centromere distal to met.
