transcriptional regulation of the met gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the met gene, coding for atp sulfurylase (atps), an enzyme implicated in methionine biosynthesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae, was cloned by functional complementation, after transformation, of a yeast met mutant strain. the cloned met gene was used as a probe to measure the specific met messenger rna in a wild type strain grown under conditions which promote or fail to promote repression of atps synthesis. it was found that the level of met messenger rna is reduced ten fold when the strain is grown under conditions where atps synthesis is repressed, suggesting that the met expression is regulated transcriptionally. the direction of transcription and the size of the transcript have been determined.
