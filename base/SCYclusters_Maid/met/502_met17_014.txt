designer deletion strains derived from saccharomyces cerevisiae sc. a useful set of strains and plasmids for pcr mediated gene disruption and other applications.. . a set of yeast strains based on saccharomyces cerevisiae sc in which commonly used selectable marker genes are deleted by design based on the yeast genome sequence has been constructed and analysed. these strains minimize or eliminate the homology to the corresponding marker genes in commonly used vectors without significantly affecting adjacent gene expression. because the homology between commonly used auxotrophic marker gene segments and genomic sequences has been largely or completely abolished, these strains will also reduce plasmid integration events which can interfere with a wide variety of molecular genetic applications. we also report the construction of new members of the prs series of vectors, containing the kanmx, ade and met genes.
