an unusual form of transcriptional silencing in yeast ribosomal dna.. . generalized transcriptional repression of large chromosomal regions in saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at the silent mating loci and at telomeres and is mediated by the silent information regulator (sir) genes. we have identified a novel form of transcriptional silencing in s. cerevisiae in the ribosomal dna (rdna) tandem array. ty retrotransposons marked with a weakened ura gene (ty mura) efficiently integrated into rdna. the mura marker in rdna was transcriptionally silenced in a sir dependent manner. met and leu were also partially silenced, indicating that rdna silencing may be quite general. deletion of sir enhanced mura and met silencing, but deletion of sir or sir did not affect silencing, indicating that the mechanism of silencing differs from that at telomeres and silent mating loci. deletion of sir resulted in increased psoralen cross linking of the rdna in vivo, suggesting that a specific chromatin structure in rdna down regulates polymerase ii promoters.
