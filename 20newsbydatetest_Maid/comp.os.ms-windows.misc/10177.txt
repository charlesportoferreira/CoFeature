(and therefore windows) use bit segmented addressing. as a programmer, i. agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things. it's annoying, too.. but when just a windows user, i don't think about it much. and, i doubt many. other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,. calcing a spreadsheet, etc...it works and they get their work done.. . just a neutral comment.. it's funny, i think, how arguments about windows vs os/ sound so very. similar to arguments about atheism vs christianity or something like that.. it's somehow very personal to people. convictions are irrational and. there's nothing wrong with that it's just...interesting.. . brad smalling . jr.ee . ga tech . atlanta, ga . gtc@prism.gatech.edu.
