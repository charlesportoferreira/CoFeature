. few months. lots of work, and imminent graduation have come in the way of . posting one of these for march or earlier this month for which i apologize.. . this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota. phone, and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with . phone. . . for additions, modifications and corrections, i can be reached at. . . best wishes,. ashok. . begin slip.txt . based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows, here. are my comments on setting up slip in this environment. i thank the. trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments.. . . configuring your modem.. . a) turn off dtr (at&d&w). i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use. to dial my slip server (qmodem) drops dtr when i exit the program. and therefore hangs up the line. if you use a program like kermit. or conex to establish the slip connection, then this need not be done.. these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.. . note. if you use univ. of minn. phone to dial and establish a. slip connection, you do not need to turn off dtr.. . b) dial and establish the slip connection first. this can be done. automatically if you use a program like phone (from the university of. minnesota) which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the. slip packet driver. the phone scripting language is simple and. phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with. other slip server. in addition, while the only packet driver. that phone works with is umslip (currently), it is easy to write a. batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers.. there is a section on phone in the document with both script and. batch file examples.. . . configuring the slip drivers.. . there are five slip packet drivers commonly available. cslipper.exe peter tattam's compressed slip driver. slipper.exe peter tattam's slip driver. slip.com crynwr driver (i like phil burn's modified driver). ethersl.com crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over slip). umslip.com univ. of minnesota driver (based on slip). . of these four, i vastly prefer c/slipper.exe over slip.com or. ethersl.com for the following reasons.. . a) it is much faster even though my modem has just a uart. b) while using etherslip/slip/umslip, myself and several others. have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a. long ftp transfer.. c) it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode. d) when used in ethernet simulation mode c/slipper seem to work with. every tcp/ip application that i have tested it with.. . instructions for c/slipper.exe (and you do not use phone). a) load slipper in your autoexec.bat file according to instructions.. for instance if you have a v.bis modem on com. slipper com vec= baud=. b) if you use dos tcp/ip applications in win . dos boxes, then use the. double ended packet driver shim winpkt.com this creates a virtual. packet driver at x. dos applications in native mode, dos. applications in windows . dos boxes and windows applications can all. use this virtual driver at x.. winpkt.com x x. c) if you use qvt/net, load pktint.com next. qvt/net is configured in. qvtnet.ini to use the interrupt at x.. pktint.com. . instructions for slip.com.. a) try getting a version slip driver. philip burns of northwestern. university has a modified slip.com driver that is better at hardware. handshaking. this driver is distributed along with nupop.. b) load the driver after establishing the slip connection. my modem is a. v.bis modem on com, so here is how i would load the driver.. slip w x h slip xf . c) as discussed above if you use dos tcp/ip applications in windows .x. dos boxes, you probably want to use winpkt.com. winpkt.com x x. d) if you use winqvt/net, load pktint.com. pktint.com. . instructions for ethersl.com.. if you choose to use ethersl.com instead of slip.com, the. instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. you. will have to delete the line "device=*vcd" from the [enh] section. of system.ini. this will interfere with running regular windows comm. applications (such as crosstalk), and you will get lots of dropped. characters etc. in these applications. this is therefore not. recommended. etherslip would be loaded as.. ethersl w x h xf . . configuring windows ... . a) make the following modifications to the system.ini file [enh]. section.. i) list all your com ports, with their addresses and interrupts.. combase=f. comirq=. combase=f. comirq=. combase=e. comirq=. this can also be done from within windows control panel,. but double clicking on the "ports" icon.. ii) give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer. combuffer=. iii) change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish. to use for your modem to zero. this is the amount of time that. windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to. another application. if you use winqvt/net and then want to switch. from one session to another, and this value is at the default value. of seconds, you are will get a gpf and windows will crash.. comautoassign=. this can also be done from within windows control panel.. double click on enhanced, and under "device contention", set. the device contention for the com port your modem is on to. "never warn". . additional notes.. . what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each. slip session?. . i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user. a permanent ip address, so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet.ini. each time that i establish a slip connection.. . if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in,. please try to use bootp aware software, and let bootp do the. configuration for you. however, qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp. will not work over a slip connection. to get qvtnet working in a. situation such as this, you must do the following.. . edit the qvtnet.ini file. let the [net] section look like this.. . [net]. name=. ip=. netmask=... (or whatever is appropriate for you). arptime=. packet vector= (or whatever is appropriate). . save the changes, and then *write protect* this file. "attrib +r qvtnet.ini". . start your slip connection, and *remember* the name and ip address. that you are assigned. each time you start qvt/net .x, the. general configuration dialog box will open. enter the name and. ip address and you were assigned for that session, click on [ok],. and you should be up and running. the changes you make will not. be saved, as qvtnet.ini is write protected.. . a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address. assignment is provided by victor menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu). victor uses the program bootpq to semi automate qvtnet preparation.. bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip, which is then saved to a. file called "myip". another file "noip" is essentially a complete. qvtnet.ini file that lacks the ip address. in the final step "myip". and "noip" are copied into a single qvtnet.ini file. an example of. victor's batch file is provided below.. =====================================================. slipper com. pktint.com. bootpq i "ip=\"%%s\"" >> myip. bootpq i "my ip# is. %s". copy /q net + myip + noip e.\com\qvtnet\qvtnet.ini. del /q myip. @echo off. echo .. echo ready to run winqvtnet. =====================================================. for questions and more details about bootpq, please contact victor. menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu). . qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvt/net.. . how do you use pktmux over slip?. . pktmux will not work over the slip.com packet driver, and crashes. immediately if used with ethersl.com. . pktmux will work with c/slipper.exe, when c/slipper is used in ethernet. simulation mode. an example of this configuration is shown below.. . the latest release of pktmux is .c; and it is important that you. use this version, if you want to use virtual packet drivers with. applications like trumpet for windows (to be released very shortly).. . [from autoexec.bat]. . lh c/slipper com vec= baud= ether (packet driver). lh pktmux / (pktmux loaded for virtual packet drivers). lh pktdrv f (first virtual packet driver used for qvt/net). lh pktint.com (qvt/net pktint.com). pktdrv (pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet). . additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within. windows . dos boxes. for example, my pif file to load popmail is. directed to the file "popmail.bat". this is what popmail.bat reads. like.. . pktdrv loads a virtual packet driver at x. cd \popmail. popmail. cd \. pktdrv /u unloads the packet driver at x. exit causes the dos window to close. . i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp/ip applications. like pc gopher. it is my experience that pktmux works fine. even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos. sessions, are loaded at the same software interrupt. for example. within two different dos boxes one for popmail and the other for. gopher, the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at x in each. instance.. . how much does pktmux degrade the performance of c/slipper?. . i have a v.bis/v.bis modem in a running windows . with. a reasonably fast video card (ati graphics ultra). under these. conditions, when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and. being used as follows.. a) driver at xf qvtnet ftp client session. b) driver at x in one dos window cutcp tn session. c) driver at x in another dos window trumpet for dos. . i get ftp transfer rates of . . kb/sec while transferring. compressed files. this rate is comparable to that which i get with. slip loaded as a packet driver, and where a single tcp/ip session. is active. if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session. is active, i get transfer rates of . . kb/sec on the same. files.. . while there is about % degradation in the performance of slipper,. for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the. performance hit.. . c/slipper and ethernet simulation mode. . in ethernet simulation mode, c/slipper ver . works with all the. applications that i have tested it with. one or two applications. that required ethernet simulation balked at c/slipper ., but even. these rare problems have been resolved with ver .. . when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode, and used with pktmux,. i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads. "ip.incorrect packet type" or "ip.bad version number". this does not. seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning, although i cannot comment on. loss of performance.. . what can you do if your dos tcp/ip application does not work with. c/slipper in ethernet simulation mode?. . in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with. c/slipper in ethernet simulation mode, first contact the author . peter tattam peter@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au, and let him. know. chances are that he can fix it.. . in the meanwhile, you can try the following. i do not know if it is. kosher, but it worked when i had problems with c/slipper ver .. . (c/slipper is loaded at x as described above under the pktmux section). . i load ethersl.com at x, run the application and then terminate. ethersl.com. . this also works within windows . virtual dos boxes. however a. packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box. at a time.. . so for example, here is my batch file to run grateful med (a. medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library. of medicine).. . ethersl w x h xf loads etherslip. cd \gm. search. cd \. termin x terminates etherslip. exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows. . if you use this method, be cautious about one thing don't have. any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time. after closing. the ethersl window, you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no. problem. btw, the example above grateful med, works with no. problems with c/slipper ver .. . phone script files.. . the documentation that accompany phone, provide good instructions on. writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than. the university of minnesota server. for example here is a script. that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend.. . background. to start a slip connection, i dial our terminal server,. and login with a username and password. after doing so, i start a slip. session with the following command "slip username slip.dialin.cwru.edu",. followed by my password again.. . here then is the relevant portion of the phone.cmd script file . #. # cwru ts slip login script by ashok aiyar //. # last revised //. procedure host.cwru.login. timeout 'cwru ts terminal server is not responding'. message "cwru ts slip login script version .". message 'waiting for slip server to respond'. quiet on. expect 'verification'. message 'request for user verification received from cwru ts'. message 'sending your user name and password'. quiet off. expect 'username.'. send '%u'. send 'slipnul. phone force hangup. goto unload. . .slipper. termin x. rem the following line must be changed to reflect the com port,. rem irq, baud rate, and software interrupt. lh c.\packet\cslipper com vec= baud= ether. goto end. . .forced. termin x. umslip >nul. phone force dial. goto slipper. . .setup. termin x. umslip >nul. phone setup. goto help. . .unload. termin x. goto end. . .bogus. echo % is not a valid command.. echo try "cwruslip help" for a list of valid commands. echo.. . .help. echo . echo case western reserve university slip setup. echo using univ. of minnesota phone. echo . echo cwruslip setup modem settings, phone number, username etc.. echo.. echo cwruslip dial dial and establish the slip connection. echo cwruslip quit hangup the phone and unload the driver. echo cwruslip help this screen. echo.. . .end. end cwruslip.bat . . where to get what...... . peter tattam's programs are archived at ftp.utas.edu.au (c/slipper,. and the trumpet set of programs).. . winqvt/net is generally archived at most windows ftp sites,. including ftp.cica.indiana.edu. . ncsa telnet is archived at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. . nupop is archived at ftp.acns.nwu.edu. . popmail/pc, slipdisk, phone, and pc gopher are archived at. boombox.micro.umn.edu. . end slip.txt . . . . . ashok aiyar mail. ashok@biochemistry.cwru.edu. department of biochemistry tel.
