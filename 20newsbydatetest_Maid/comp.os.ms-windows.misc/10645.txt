from. .@compuserve.com (darla). subject. deltapoints animated desktop. organization. utexas mail to news gateway. lines. . nntp posting host. cs.utexas.edu. . hiyas all,. . upon getting animated desktop for windows as a gift from my boyfriend, i . couldn't wait to install it. i had gotten an advertisement for it and put . it aside . with my list of 'i wants.' after installing the software, it didn't load. . no part of . the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.. . i called deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty . million different questions about my system.. concluded that i had one of . the . systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. of course they're . willing to . give me my $$$ back.. what a waste of time and energy. the folks on their . support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings . of . windows .. . after my experience with the installation of the sb , i learned . some of the function of windows dll files. before sending back desktop . animator, decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of . . .dll files i had. i had versions of cpalette.dll one dated / and > . k the . other dated / and smaller (the / smaller version was the one supplied . . with desktop animator). i moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll . to a . directory outside my path. (for some reason, i had the older cpalette.dll . in my . windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) . when i did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did other of the . applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. does . anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions . . for trouble shooting?. . / \ darla. .\ / @ \. \ \ . \ ..> portal. darla@shell.portal.com. \ ##. . \ / darla@cup.portal.com . . ####\ / \ aol. kubyu@aol.com. / / ## \. darlaiam@aol.com. / / \ \ wix. darla .genie. kuby . l jj \ jj . .
