(update from v. to v.). . in this version, we have revised cosy pak to take advantage of . the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v.. . since mathematica . provides a better and working . laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than . mathematica v. did, we adopted them. this has made cosy pak . smaller. thus brian evans' signal processing packages that supported . the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the . cosy pak v. are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v.. for . power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very . fine brian evans package on signal processing (available at . the anonymous ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu or ip # ...). on . the downside, the disadvantage of this update . can be that mathematica . requires more runtime resources than its . previous version. . . . *********************************************************************** . > for mathematica . users. . we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica . in . the directory `for .'. please move all files and directory under for . into . the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. . . **************************************************************************. . > introduction. . this is an unsupported release of cosy pak a control systems . analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using . mathematica .. classical control systems analysis and design methods and some . modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. . . this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a . next (tm) computer (a unix based workstation). they have been . used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control . engineering texts (ogata [], phillips and harbor []) for . undergraduate courses in `control engineering i' taught at the systems . engineering department of cwru. in addition to the next, they have . also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers (tm), and, . ibm pc's (tm) running ms windows(tm). we would be very much interested . to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on . platforms not mentioned above. ibm users however will have to . evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.. . once installed (see below for instructions), this collection of . mathematica packages can be loaded by any user. bundled with the . packages are many notebooks ("cosy notes") which demonstrate . the functionality of these packages. the notebooks follow a plan of . many fine, standard, undergraduate control engineering text books . listed in the references. examples used in these notebooks have . been collected from the various references given at the end of this . file. the contents of the notebooks in the "cosy notes" directory are . given below.. . begin "cosy notes" contents . . notebook file name. introduction.ma. chapter . introduction to control systems. . sections. . analyticity. poles and zeros. signals. forward laplace transforms. inverse laplace transforms. differential equation with zero valued initial conditions. differential equation with initial conditions. . . . notebook file name. math models.ma. chapter . mathematical modeling of dynamic systems. . sections. . ode to state space . linearization of a nonlinear system of equations . state space to transfer function. . . . notebook file name. * transient response.ma. chapter . transient response analysis .
