(i have it set to com as the port to use) i don't have. anything plugged into com, and i've looked over the manual. for all it's worth, but what am i missing? the modem is . jumpered for com/irq, which i understand means i can't. use the second serial port and the modem at the same time,. but i'm not using the second serial port anyway.. also, when using procomm + for dos, it always sees the modem. and dials, but doesn't always connect me when the other end. answers. don't know if that helps any.. . thanks,. . brian d. reed bdr@cbnewsg.cb.att.com . .
