(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os/.). . > for instance, i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed. > wp . (dos) locks up my system.. . yeah, i guess i'm willing to admit that os/ is somewhat sensitive to. specific hardware. wp for dos works perfectly fine on my slc.... . > please explain. the only time i wait on anything under windows is. > when i'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even. > then, not long i get to pages dumped to the printman per . > minute, and can still go do things slowly while it's doing . > this i've downloaded with pp+ @ while printing).. . well, i save all my personal files to floppy, and when i did that. under windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.. . i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the. tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal. computation in the background.. . >> and not being able to address your memory better than dos,. . > not sure what you mean here.. . the idea is that os/'s dos sessions can see more memory than windows. dos sessions. i let xpl (a shareware calculus program) see around. kb of free conventional memory, which lets me do bigger symbolic. manipulations than is possible under straight dos (where it would see. around kb of conventional ram.). i also found it really handy for. my own dos based programs, which, without any re writing, could now. handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. of course,. the point is now moot, since the os/ programs i now write simply. never run into memory limitations. i never programmed for windows,. so i don't have much of a comparison here, though.....
