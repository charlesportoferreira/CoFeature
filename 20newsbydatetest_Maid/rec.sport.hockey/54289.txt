(). . an interesting note ... i have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.. i picked all my players about weeks before the start of the season, and. then never touched the roster again. i got wrapped up in my own "money" pool. and decided not to get involved at all with the usenet pool (sorry andrew. btw). the only thing i remember about my team is that i had joe sacco and. maybe john maclean. maybe francis and kevin stevens as well. out of. curiousity i checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my. amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to. finsh th! i'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me. .). . ciao.. brad gibson. . . . brad k. gibson internet. gibson@geop.ubc.ca. dept. of geophysics & astronomy . # main mall phone.
