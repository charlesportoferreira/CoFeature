(i think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess.... . (the title was the only thing they changed/added). . "gun stats". . the daily recently reprinted an article from the. wall street journal, primarily concerned with paxton. quigley, author of "armed and female." the article,. in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally. reported in the new england journal of medicine. the. article states, "a study... found that a gun in the home. was times more likely to be used to kill its owner,. spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder." this. is an often quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev . eral reasons, outlined below.. . the study gives the impression that, if you own a . gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to . defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned. against you. the study, however, fails to take into. account cases where a law abiding citizen uses a gun . to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe . trator.. . the study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather. than 'friend'. this would include the friendly neigh . borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every. month, the second your grandmother cashes her social. security check. possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a. friend.. . the nejm study is based on the immediate dis . position of cases and fails to take into account cases. originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be. self defense. especially considering the small sample . size (), taking these events into account has a sub . stantial effect on the . ratio quoted.. . criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif . erent statistic. a gun is times more likely to be . used, successfully, by a private citizen against an . aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further, per . sons defending themselves from aggression by using a . gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by. some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.. statistics available from the fbi and other agencies . also show that a gun is times more likely to be. used by a non criminal to defend against criminal threat. than to be used to commit criminal homicide, times. more likely to be used to defend against a criminal. threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and times. more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be. used to commit suicide.. . it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can . be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has. to consider carefully what questions were asked by. those gathering the data before one can draw an accu . rate conclusion from them.. . d.f. taylor. cu department of chemistry and biochemistry. . . . spooksmoke. revolution, assasination, thorium, cobalt , clintin, cia, nsa, shc. dod # / loki@acca.nmsu.edu / liberty or death / taylordf@ucsu.colorado.edu . send me something even you can't read.... begin pgp public key block . version. .. . mqcnaitfksqaaaeeakceejwifkmjykplogcdghrpbmyxhookpehmdyufa. bfdqsjkostzhroshsdzlvul/vpjmmntfr+vyzjvdrliuqummmexm. itfultxn/v/qabsvhcfshvjvklfwosucmomtixaivbuzoyxjaaux. tcreywpzwwgribuyxlsbigpexvalaywnjysubxnlmvkdt=. =sib. end pgp public key block .
