(the. figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the. criminal.) wright and rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents. of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and. probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of. guns. wright and rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime. directly target the black market in criminal guns, and. leave the legitimate retail market alone.{} not surprisingly, wright. believes that the consequences of current "assault weapon" legislation on. street violence are likely to be ineffective.{} he warns that gun. controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of. criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new. business.{}. . . see, e.g., the anti drug, assault weapons limitation act of . s.. rep. no. , st. cong., st. sess.
