(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). . . note that power is.. . p = f * v. . where p is power (lbf ft/s), f is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v. is velocity (ft/s). . . note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting d for. force) you get a velocity cubed term. that's why huge increases in power. result in little increases in speed. ditto for decreases in cd. . . so if you have a mph car and reduce cd from . to ., your new top. speed is. (sound of trumpet fanfare). . mph. . sorry to dissappoint.. . . . al bowers dod # alfa ducati hobie kottke 'blad iaido nasa.
