(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough. to qualify for the manufacturer's cup, or whichever series it. was that shelby broke ferarri's year winning streak in in '),. and they are all accounted for. the last price i saw estimated on a. gt was a little bit over $,, (yes, that's right, one million. us dollars; it was second only to some worthless piece of ferrari. that it would blow the doors off of ; ).. . i don't recall off hand what the drive configuration was, although. i'm certain some must have been lhd, as they had to be sold to qualify. for racing. the drivertrain was the ford (hi riser, i think, . and/or side oiler) coupled to various speed transmissions. they. also used speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the. original trannys breaking under the load of the . layout was. rear engine, rear drive, with the "bundle of snakes" exhaust. headers...i can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but i. can't remember whether they applied to the gt or the shelby. cobra daytona coupe...i'll try and find that reference.. . james. . james p. callison microcomputer coordinator, u of oklahoma law center . callison@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu /\ callison@aardvark.ucs.uoknor.edu . disclaimer. i'm not an engineer, but i play one at work.... the forecast calls for thunder...' t bird sc.
