"pony car" class came from) with a performance model. that's. why it has the econo box running gear. that was also factored. into the design of the mustang from the day lee iacocca conceived. his baby; it was designed as a wide market car sporty, yet . accessible with room for performance tweaking.. . the cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,. and they both fit those niches very well. the mustang, at least,. does well in multiple markets; i can't speak for the camaro.. . james. . james p. callison microcomputer coordinator, u of oklahoma law center . callison@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu /\ callison@aardvark.ucs.uoknor.edu . disclaimer. i'm not an engineer, but i play one at work.... the forecast calls for thunder...' t bird sc.
