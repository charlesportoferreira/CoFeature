from. gibbonsa@fraser.sfu.ca (darren gibbons). subject. datsun/nissan //z cars. organization. simon fraser university, burnaby, b.c., canada. lines. . . well, the opel deal fell through.... . now i'm looking at a datsun z for sale in our local buy&sell. any. previous owners have any experience with these cars? besides looking. for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car. things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that. i should watch out for?. . how about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc. these cars. look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing. resemblance to the aston martin db zagato(sp?), which has to be one. of the most beatiful cars ever made.. . what is the difference between z, z, z? the zx is rather . unappealing imho, but the other cars are decent.. thanks again.... darren gibbons. gibbonsa@sfu.ca. .
