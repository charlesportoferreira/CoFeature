(the cse is hp. mercedes is rear drive, so it. does not have this problem.). ) huge interior and cargo space.. ) the most "rubbery" shifter i have ever encountered. i drove a spd. it. was absolutely numb. you might be able to get used to it i don't know.. i also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.. from the shifter's position, i got the impression that saab really designed. the car for an automatic.. ) it was rather noisy. engine buzz, rattles, and creaks. (mercedes does. not exhibit these characteristics.). . you should also check out the new bmw "touring". this is a wagon version. of the i. it fits into the class with the te and saabs.. . . michael chmilar. chmilar@apple.com.
