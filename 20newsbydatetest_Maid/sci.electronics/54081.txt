from. fmg@alpha.smi.med.pitt.edu (filip gieszczykiewicz). subject. switching ps questions. summary. i know basics, !commercial models, qs. organization. medical informatics, pittsburgh, pa usa. lines. . . . greetings. i've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators. and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies.... (before anyone flames me, i know, both have their place . ). . anyways, i've built the basic up & down converters with pretty. good results (>% efficiency) but i'm running into problems. when i try to design & build anything that puts out serious. amps... i know it can be done (i have some v@a guts on my. bench) but something puzzles me. i'm using a simple choke as . the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding). but all commercial models use transformers with many windings.. i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for. the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose. me... what are they for? better than that, anyone have a full. schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of? i'd. love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such. low volume . ). . my other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are. ) lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and ). limited knowledge of the whole topic... i'm doing this on my. own (not school) mind you (in fact, i have yet to take any. course that covers transistors ; ). . so, is the answer to # the accumulation of dead commercial. models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what. i'm doing now...) and # getting & understanding schematics. and a bit more of the [mind boggling] theory? . . take care.. . p.s. my goal is v @ ~a in (car battery) > vac out and. (on the other end) v > +vdc @ a, v @ a, +vdc @a. and vdc @a... the distance between the two will be. more than feet (of gauge) but less than feet.. would like to have a working model in a year or so... . ) . (do i have a chance to make it?). . / filip "i'll buy a vowel" gieszczykiewicz. . best e mail "fmgst+@pitt.edu" \. . all ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $. so respond now!!!! . . . i live for my ee major, winsurfing, programming, sca, and assorted dreams. .. \ mb drive linux has mb and ms dos has mb. ms dos is worried ; ) /.
