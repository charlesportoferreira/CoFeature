(octave, / octave, etc). thus the khz khz octave has the same. amount of noise power as the hz hz octave.. white noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment. (hz, khz, etc). thus the khz .khz band has the same amount of. noise power as the hz hz band (both bands are hz wide).. pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a db/octave. filter (usually approximated by a network of several rc pairs).. note. you can't get db/octave by using half a db/octave network . . (. pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.. it shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave related bands). as a flat line across the bands.. . davep.
