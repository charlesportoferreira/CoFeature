from. christopher kristof . subject. ??? mystery part ???. organization. freshman, electrical and computer engineering, carnegie mellon, pittsburgh, pa. lines. . nntp posting host. po.andrew.cmu.edu. . i have a mystery part labeled nec ac. it's from the low voltage. supply of an nec multisync i monitor. it's a three lead part in a. square package like a volate regulator or power transistor. the board. is labeled cr where the part goes. (possibly an scr?) the pin. labeled g on the board goes to a zener diode (reference voltage?); the. pin labeled t goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power. supply, and the pin labeled t goes to the negative side of the bridge. rectifier in the supply.. . if anyone can tell me what this is, or better yet, where i can buy. one just like it, please email me at cki@andrew.cmu.edu. i've called. nec's "monitor repair number" and not only do they not know what the. part is, but they don't think that they can find one to sell to me... . it makes no sense to me.... . thanks.
