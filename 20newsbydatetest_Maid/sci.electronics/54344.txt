( hz to khz, if i . recall correctly.) you can get them to work at vrms, hz (i.e.,. line) but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster.. (oh yes, almost forgot, el's have this tendency to wear out over time...). . . joseph chiu . josephc@cco.caltech.edu "os/. you gotta get this thing!" . msc caltech . . pasadena, ca . dear ibm. hire bunch of technically incompetent people. + .
