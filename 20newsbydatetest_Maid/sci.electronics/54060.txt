[ question about packet radio deleted ]. >. > / / / / georgia state university . . how about rec.radio.amateur.packet? at least at my site, there is no. general packet radio (i.e. non amateur) newsgroup.. . that said, i would definately subscribe to r.r.a.packet if you want to. learn about all aspects of amateur packet radio, at both the high and. low ends. also, i would get the faq from the group, and then post any. specific questions to that group. everything i could tell you is . probably in the faq, and the people who really know what's going on all. seem to be on r.r.a.packet (although they might be here too, you never know .). . hope it helps.... . andy collins, kcyey. acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu.
