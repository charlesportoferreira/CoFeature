from. idh@nessie.mcc.ac.uk (ian hawkins). subject. making up odd resistor values required by filters. organization. manchester computing centre. lines. . . when constructing active filters, odd values of resistor are often required . (i.e. something like a . k ohm resistor).(it seems best to choose common . capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).. . is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such. a resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard values per decade?.(,. .,.,.,.,. etc ). it is a common enough problem, yet i cant . recall seing a program that tells that rx+ry//rz gives rq, starting with . q and finding prefered values x,y and z.. . . cheers. ian h . .
