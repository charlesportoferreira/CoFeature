(or ) of the slots are. vl bus capable. the air people confirmed this board supports 'real'. bit eisa dma (i called them). pentium/p (?) capable. less expensive. than equivalent ami or micronics vl/eisa board.. . look in computer shopper (april '). the zenon ads show the air mother . board. a associate bought the air board and is pleased with it. i'm. attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the hawk board for the. air board.. . model number of air board (with dx) is bei. you can call. motherboard warehouse (for example) for a price. phone #'s included. below.. . air () . motherboard warehouse () . . . gary korenek (korenek@nmti.com). network management technology incorporated. sugar land, texas () .
