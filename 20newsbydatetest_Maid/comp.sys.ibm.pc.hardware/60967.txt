from. joe eddy demers . subject. bios timer interrupts. organization. sophomore, math/computer science, carnegie mellon, pittsburgh, pa. lines. . nntp posting host. po.andrew.cmu.edu. . hello,. i'm trying to use the bios timer interrupts (which occur every .. seconds, or . times a second) to time people's response times, in a. psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .. seconds. is there any way i can get better precision than by counting. ticks? or can i make the ticks occur more frequently? i'm trying to do. this in dos . on a , and it would be nice if this could also work. on our old machines running dos . (i know, i know, i don't like. them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a. possibility. . so, basically, any information on the bios tick scheme and the. related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on. alternate ways of improving accuracy. email is preferred, as i'm. planning on posting this to a few boards, and i don't read all of them.. thanks. . joe. .
