(hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable. the use of irq , usually by merely breaking the connection between. the isa pin and the associated driver. other adapters control the. irq line by a tri state driver, and by programming just leave it. in the high impedence mode.. . unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate. drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the irq lines. rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't. assert anything). the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes. the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically . disconnected by a jumper.. . (incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold. the irq line low when no interrupt is desired. if that were true. you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines, and. that certainly isn't a requirement.). . non dos operating systems (os/, nt (?), various unices or whatever the. proper plural of unix might be) require the use of irq for performance. reasons. . . and the sb, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.. . joe morris / mitre (jcmorris@mitre.org).
