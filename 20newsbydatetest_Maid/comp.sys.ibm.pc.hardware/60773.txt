from. gwesp@cosy.sbg.ac.at (gerhard wesp). subject. datasave videostreamer. nntp posting host. frosch. organization. university of salzburg / austria. x newsreader. tin [version . pl]. lines. . . a few weeks ago i saw an ad in the german magazine c't. about a so called videostreamer. this is an interface. between a pc's parallel port and any video recorder for. backing up your data on a videotape. the company (datasave?). claims that it can store up to gb on a minutes tape.. ^^^^^^^^^^. . it costs dm . (about usd , i think). . my question is.. does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes . really fit on a minutes tape ( gb sounds quite. unbelievable to me). . . however, any comments on the interface are appreciated.. please mail your replies directly to me, i will sum up. if neccesary. thanks in advance.... . gerhard.
