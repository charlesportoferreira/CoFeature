from. tp@fir.canberra.edu.au (ben elliston). subject. floppy problems. lines. . . organization. compact solutions, canberra act australia. . i have a floppy drive which has developed "general failure" errors. (it's a teac .mb ." drive).. . i took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. i used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.. . however, it didn't help the problem. i've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time. what i mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.. . is there anything more i can do to try and save this drive? i'd prefer not to shell out $ for a new one if i can help it.. . thanks!. . cheers, ben. . ben j. elliston. bachelor of engineering (computer engineering) \\\//. university of canberra (@ @). ooo ( ) ooo . email. compsol@fir.canberra.edu.au v. also. ellib@cbr.cpsg.com.au. uucp. ..!uunet!munnari!sserve.adfa.oz.au!compsol!root. fidonet. ./. . . * origin. % compact solutions % canberra act australia % (./).
