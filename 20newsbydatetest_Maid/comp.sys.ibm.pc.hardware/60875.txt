from. linda@cs.su.oz.au (linda distributed language). subject. help with et hicolor modes. organization. basser dept of computer science, university of sydney, australia. keywords. video, et. lines. . . can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal. width hides out on the tseng labs et with a // bit dac?. i am trying to use the xxm mode under unix (so i cant just call int h)i have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but i. am not sure i trust it for the extended registers of the et.. anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the horizontal total register. (dh index) is apparently set to x, but dh index (the displayed clocks). is set to xef, so x is nonsense. a resonable value would be x so is. there a high bit, and if so, where is it?. also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and. what would be an appropriate frequency?). the documentation isn't really very. clear (tseng.txt from vgadoc.zip from some ftp site) about this.. my card is a megavga/ mb card. seems to have a tseng labs bios (ver . i. think.) works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the. non hicolor modes. great for running x windows in up to xxni if your. monitor will take it (only just in my case).. . please email the answer, as i can't read news very often.. . thanks very much,. david. .
