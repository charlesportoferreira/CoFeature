(it's an. *old* tape drive.) my solution was to use irq (also used for com, where my. modem is). i did this because i reasoned i would never be using the modem and. the tape simultaneously. when kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt. handler for irq and uses the serial port. if the tape drive were to generate. an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape. controller. (and since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would. most likely "hang.") likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it. installs an interrupt handler for irq. that handler won't do anything for. the serial port.. . under dos, printing is not interrupt driven. instead, the bios polls the. status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.. that's why you can have your sound card and lpt both configured to use irq.. try that on nt and see how far you'll get. . ). . kenneth r. ballou voice.
