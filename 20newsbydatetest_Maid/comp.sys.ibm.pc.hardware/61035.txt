from. kin chan . subject. floptical drives anyone??. organization. freshman, math/computer science, carnegie mellon, pittsburgh, pa. lines. . nntp posting host. po.andrew.cmu.edu. . just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. remember. those mb disks that look and feel like ." floppies? these drives. are scsi devices and can read and write both kb and ./ mb. disks. sounds to me to be one great product for the pc market. are the. prices really that unaffordable compared to cd roms which are currently. not rewritable? i know about the new rewritable cds and expect sony to. develop the first mds for the computer. my question is. why isn't there. any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?. . just a thought.. . kin chan. sparrow+@cmu.edu.
