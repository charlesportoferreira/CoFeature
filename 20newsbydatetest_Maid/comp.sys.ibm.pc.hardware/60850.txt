from. rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca (ross mitchell). subject. dx isa,vlb xor dx eisa ?? advice wanted.... organization. university of western ontario, london. nntp posting host. vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca. lines. . . . hi.. . i need some advice (opinions?) regarding which pc would best suit my needs!. i want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things. . . editing documents using wordperfect . (under dos). . creating graphs/analyzing data using sigmaplot v. (under dos). . editing/playing with images using aldus photostyler, running under . windows . these images can be large, say k x k, bits/pixel. . using the pc as an xterminal, running desqview/x . and sun pc nfs, . talking to our network of sparcstation's this is where a lot of. the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.. . i've read, read, read pc magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,. and decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be.. . dx k cache, isa, vlb, meg ram. ati graphics ultra pro, meg ram, local bus. " monitor, x ni. com etherlink iii bit. maxtor mb ide hard drive. . however, the parts don't fit! our local retailer apparently put one of these. together, only to discover that the ati card wouldn't run at mhz surprise. surprise. actually, after reading this group, i'm surprised that they even. have a mhz local bus running.... . i have a choice now between basically the above system but with a. dx with isa and vlb, or, a dx with eisa and no vlb (and thus. the non local bus version of the ati card). which is better, keeping in mind. that i'm primarily interested in the last two tasks? . . any help would be greatly appreciated! (i need to decide quickly, so any . speedy help would be appreciated even more!!). . . . btw. we have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following . configuration.. . dx k cache, isa, meg ram. ati graphics ultra+, meg ram. " monitor, x ni. smc ethercard bit. maxtor mb ide hard drive. . we're quite happy with the ati card very fast, once the data gets to it!!. ~slow~ repainting images under photostyler that have moved off screen, or. been uncovered! . . there doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running desqview/x! its sluggish. running the local window manager. also, many functions under photostyler take. a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).. . there's not enough memory in the system desqview/x and a meg smartdrive. don't leave much room for other apps. photostyler will page to disk with. medium size images.. . i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this. machine sustains only k/sec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain k/sec . on the same network. going to the bit version of the smc card increases. transfer rates to k/sec still very slow (especially when moving large . images). is there such a thing as a local bus ethernet card coming?? will it. make a difference? i'm hoping so, and leaning towards the dx choice . (above), for that reason.. . also, are there dx 's on the horizon? what about dx 's? dx 's ???!. . any information is greatly appreciated.. . . ross mitchell, imaging research lab, . rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca. john p. robarts research institute .. p.o. box , perth drive . office.
