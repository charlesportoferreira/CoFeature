(in its primary. mode of operation, lapm), but that's about as far as that goes.. . and just in case there's some confusion on this, v./v.bis are also. supported by the courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).. . >the difference. >with the courier, is that it can run at . and only in the hst mode. . . take a second look at the original question.. . >in a previous article, cssdae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (holly ks) says.. >>what is the difference between the us robotics courier vbis external. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^. see the v.bis up there? the question was not about the courier hst. modem, or about the courier dual standard...it was about the courier. v.bis modem. the modem in question does not support hst, period. it. therefore does not support the . kb hst.. . also, not all courier hst / courier dual standard modems support the . kb. version of hst. my dual standard only supports hst at . kb. there are. even older models that only run hst at . kb.. . >this is a proprietary mode of usr and it will only connect to another of. >the same type unit to achieve this speed.. . hst is usr's proprietary modulation scheme.... but we're not talking about. hst, we're talking about v.bis. v.bis is most definitely *not* a. proprietary modulation scheme.. . >the sportster will do. >asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous. the hst is one way. >only.. . i do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some. way...... . first off, v. and v.bis are both synchronous and asynchronous. this is. part of the ccitt recommendation (i.e., part of the standard). it isn't a. feature unique to the sportster (i just looked at the appropriate chapter. in the courier ds manual).. . second, hst is not ``one way only.'' more correctly put, it is an. asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed. in both directions. hst operates at [. / . / .] in one direction,. and has a low speed back channel in the other direction. the high speed. channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow. this is fine if. you're logged on to say, a bbs, and type one letter and get screens of. info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc.... there is, of course,. a penalty for turnaround time when the high speed channel needs to reverse. directions.. . v. and v.bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full. data rate in both directions at the same time.. . third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with. symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.. . >the hst's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.. . again, more correctly put, *some* of the courier line will be upgradeable. to whatever ``v.fast'' is called when it's complete. if you have the large. footprint courier modems (like i do), you're s.o.l..... there was an. upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which. could eventually be upgraded to support v.fast, but the cost of the two. upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.. . later...... jim. . . #include de nial (/). . internet. jim@nial.mythical.com . j.graham@ieee.org icbm. .n .w. amateur radio. nial@wzbb (ft. walton beach, fl) amtor selcal. nial. . e mail me for information about kamterm (host mode for kantronics tncs).. .
