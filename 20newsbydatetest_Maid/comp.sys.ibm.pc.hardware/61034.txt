from. randy ellingson. subject. scsi or ide. the bottom line. reply to. randy@msc.cornell.edu. organization. cornell university. lines. . . which would you choose, and why?. . like lots of people, i'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from. the hard drive. right now i have a ms mb ide drive (seagate a), and. a standard ide controller card on my isa .. . i'm currently thinking about adding another hd, in the mb to mb range.. and i'm thinking hard about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit).. i believe i'm getting something like kb/sec transfer right now (according. to nu).. . how would this number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for. my isa pc, and the state of the art scsi hard drive (the best system i could. hope for)?. . obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would. you want to use on your isa system? and how much would it cost?. . along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd's if i. were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my mb, ms hd?. and how much would it cost?. . thanks for any comments.. . randy. .
