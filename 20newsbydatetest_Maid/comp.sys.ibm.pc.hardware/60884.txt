(i have not made measures, so someone else may. share experience on that.). . also, the dx/ is faster in the operations, that run off internal. cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.. so my advice is the /vlb.. . . we're quite happy with the ati card very fast, once the data gets to it!!. . ~slow~ repainting images under photostyler that have moved off screen, or. . been uncovered! . . . there doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running desqview/x! its sluggish. . running the local window manager. also, many functions under photostyler take. . a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).. . . there's not enough memory in the system desqview/x and a meg smartdrive. . don't leave much room for other apps. photostyler will page to disk with. . medium size images.. . have you tried running photostyler without the cache? no need to have. paging and cache both. (well, you might argue, that the paging is. cached). my belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more. memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).. . . i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this. . machine sustains only k/sec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain k/sec . . on the same network. going to the bit version of the smc card increases. . transfer rates to k/sec still very slow (especially when moving large . . images). is there such a thing as a local bus ethernet card coming?? will it. . make a difference? i'm hoping so, and leaning towards the dx choice . . (above), for that reason.. . the bandwidth (theoretical) of isa is over mb/s, which is far from. .mb/s. i tried my isa ide hard drive (maxtor mb) and got the. same results .mb/s regardless of the isa bus speed. (. .mhz). so i guess, that just the card/drivers combination is. lousy.. . . also, are there dx 's on the horizon? what about dx 's? dx 's ???!. . the rumors are that dx (if any) is the most likely chip to come. out. but note, that ibm is closest to the technology an it will only. sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the mb.. . . any information is greatly appreciated.. . just some view, not much figures.. . . penio penev x () (w) internet. penev@venezia.rockefeller.edu. . disclaimer. all oppinions are mine..
