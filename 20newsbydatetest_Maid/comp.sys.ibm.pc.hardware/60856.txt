from. scholten@epg.nist.gov (robert scholten). subject. re. how hot should the cpu be?. organization. nist. distribution. na. lines. . . the temp on my dx/ is over c (measured with a k type thermocouple . and fluke dig thermometer). this is an "idle" temp not doing lots of. bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing bit protected mode etc. this. is in a micron computer, without heatsink.. . i recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but i might take the fan off. it. makes a horrible whine at times, and i wonder what the vibration is doing to. the pins on the cpu etc.... . . rob scholten. scholten@epg.nist.gov.
