from. ngai@nova.bellcore.com (john ngai). subject. questions on installing pas in gwk dx v. nntp posting host. nova.bellcore.com. reply to. ngai@apostle.bellcore.com. organization. bellcore. lines. . . i went out and bought the pas yesterday, and installed it into my gateway. dx v. i followed the instructions and set the sb side with dma and irq. (the default) and then the pas side with dma and irq . my question is how. should i configure for mpu compatibility. the manual and installation. program recommended irq, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to. irq . so can i still use irq, or should i choose a different one? right now. i have the mpu emulation mode turned off. actually what is this "cascade to. irq " business? . . a related questions (to other gw or vl bus machine owners) i was told that . only dma , , are bit dmas, and are bit dmas. now what about. bit vl bus mastering dmas?? which dma channel(s) is used by the vl bus. extension to do bit dma?. . yet another question, after installing pas, my links (golf game) will hang. the machine when i select sb mode and run, but works with adlib mode??. civilization however works fine ( at least so far). any body knows what i might. have done wrong? . . thanks (i am obviously a newbie) john. .
