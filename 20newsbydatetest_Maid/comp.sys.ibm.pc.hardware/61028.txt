from. @brahms.udel.edu (oliver p weatherbee). subject. micron computer owners, please read!. nntp posting host. brahms.udel.edu. organization. university of delaware. lines. . . . i have uploaded the most recent windows drivers for the cirrus gd . chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu. (file is dr.zip). they're very recent, i downloaded them from the . cirrus bbs ( ) last night. if you are unable to get them there, . email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well. . i have a local bus based card (vl bitblaster from micron) but i think . the drivers work with isa cards (or at least includes drivers for them).. . i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the . version, . improving my graphic winmarks (v.) by about million (. to .) . although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on . cirrus's part but i don't think so.. . from steve gibson's (columnist for info world) graphic card comparisons . (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) i extracted the . following for the sake of comparison.. . wintach. winbn. word sprsht cad paint overall. steve's system.. / vlb.. ati graphics ultra pro . . . . . .. . my system . sx/ vlb.. vl bitblaster . . . . . .. . . its no viper, but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of . the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson's review.. . micron system owner's, i would be interested to hear your opinions on the . dtc vl local bus disk controller. my system came with a maxtor . drive ( mb) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about kb/s, . i am now at kb/s. is this about as good as it gets? i can't get a norton's. sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at . least that was what the program said.. . . oliver weatherbee. oliver@earthview. .
