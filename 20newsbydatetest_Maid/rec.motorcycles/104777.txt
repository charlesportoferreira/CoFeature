from. gdhg@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (george heinz). subject. what do i do with old gasoline? help!. organization. university of illinois at urbana. lines. . . i have a ' cl which i stopped riding about years ago (i upgraded. to an ' sabre ). i parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and planned. on draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store.. well, after a lot of procrastination, all i ended up doing was throwing a . tarp on it.. . well, now i have to move and want to clean up the . i tried starting it. (with someone else's battery) and had no luck. my first guess is that it is. the gas and so i plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (i can only. pray that i didn't trash the carbeurators). the question is, what do i do. with this old gas? i am not going to run it in my sabre, and i think that. there is enough that i don't want to burn it (campus police don't think. too kindly about bonfires). dumping it isn't a great idea. . . thanks for any ideas,. george heinz. . . win the $,, question what does this c code do?
