(i. must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information. on usenet!). . . >. no one is presumably going to say they're gay if they're not. but. >some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys. thus. >the % is a lower limit.. . this is the problem. people have to have a lot of confidence in . the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak . freely about stuff like that. but i agree that if someone's . going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming. to be straight rather than the other way around.. . . >i still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage. >between and %.. . i don't see why there's any more evidence for this figure than any. other. it seems totally arbitrary. . . . . peter. .
