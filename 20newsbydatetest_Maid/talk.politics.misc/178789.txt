(if i am incorrect about this, please . feel free to correct it. this is just what i've been able to pick . up.). . i've just got a couple of questions about this whole thing.. () why did the government feel they needed to assault that compound?. () why didn't they try to flush them out in the first week of. this fiasco instead of waiting days.. () janet reno jumped up to take responsibilty to take heat away. from the president. does this sound anything like what a couple. of reagan's aides did?. . aaron. . . . . . . . .
