"stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not. make with average effort." using the defensive averages posted. by sherri nichols (thanks sherri!), i've figured out some defensive stats. for the centerfielders. hits stolen have been redefined as "plays juan. gonzalez would not have made.". . ok, i realize that's unfair. juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,. fluke shots, and a monster park factor. but let's put it this way. if we. replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with kevin's .% out. making ability, how many extra hits would go by?. . to try and correlate it to reality a little more, i've calculated net. hits stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league. average fielder would make. by the same method i've calculated net extra . bases (doubles and triples let by).. . finally, i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution, or. dcon . >. basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.. i add this number to ops to get dops (defense + onbase plus slug), which. should represent the player's total contribution to the team. so don't. take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this. article.. . the short version definition of terms. hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell. nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder. ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder. neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder. dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented, as a rate.. dops dcon + ops quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.. . national league. . name hs nhs neb dcon dops. nixon, o. . .. grissom, m. . .. jackson, d. . .. lewis, d. . .. dykstra, l. . .. dascenzo, d. . .. finley, s. . .. lankford, r. . .. martinez, d. . .. vanslyke, a. . .. sanders, r. . .. butler, b. . .. johnson, h. . .. . ordered by dops. . . vanslyke. . lankford. . grissom. . dykstra. . nixon. . finley. . sanders. . jackson. . *nl average*. . butler. . martinez. . dascenzo. . lewis. . johnson. . american league. . . name hs nhs neb dcon dops. lofton, k. . .. wilson, w. . .. white, d. . .. felix, j. . .. devereaux, m. . .. mcrae, h. . .. yount, r. . .. kelly, r. . .. johnson, l. . .. griffey, k. . .. puckett, k. . .. cuyler, m. . .. gonzalez, j. . .. . . order by dops. . . lofton. . griffey. . devereaux. . white. . puckett. . wilson. . gonzalez. . yount. . felix. . *al average*. . kelly. . johnson. . mcrae. . cuyler. . more discussion . . dcon formula. ((nhs + ndp)/pa) + ((nhs + ndp + neb)/ab). why such a bizzare formula? basically, it's designed to be added into the. ops, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored".. the extra outs are factored into obp, while the extra bases removed are . factored into slg. that's why i used pa and ab as the divisors.. . for more discussion see the post on hits stolen first base . . dale j. stephenson .*.
