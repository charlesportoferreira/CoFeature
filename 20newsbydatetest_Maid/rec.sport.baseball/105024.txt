"back end" perfect game.. . how many other games including extra inning games have seen a pitcher. retire straight, excluding official perfect games?. . the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie. shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in. cooperstown. shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got. thrown out for arguing over the first batter walk; shore picked him off and. retired straight after that.. . matt wall * wall@cc.swarthmore.edu * hey, i gotta job here, ok?. . april , . boston red sox seize first place..
