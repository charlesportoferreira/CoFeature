from. rising@zoo.toronto.edu (jim rising). subject. a modest request. organization. u of toronto zoology. lines. . . i am finding the volume of stuff on rec.sport.baseball. overwhelming ca. posts/day. an effect of this is. that a backlog builds up, and many posts get dumped from. my system. i could probably fix that but don't have the. time to read them all in any event. my guess is that mine. is a common problem. i have some ideas that would help.. . . each person generally post no more than one article/day.. . limit the extent to which previous posts are reproduced. in posts.. . don't post mindless `woofs,' or `anti woofs,' e.g. "the. jays are best!" or "the jays suck.". . don't respond to mindless posts, e.g. "jack morris is. a better pitcher than frank viola because he's won a . world series." i know that you can use the `n' key to. get by these posts, but they bump interesting posts from. my disk.. . use the goddamn shift key etc it makes your posts easier. to read . . name. jim rising. mail. dept. zoology, univ. toronto, toronto, ontario, canada ms a. uucp. uunet!attcan!utzoo!rising . bitnet. rising@zoo.utoronto.ca.
