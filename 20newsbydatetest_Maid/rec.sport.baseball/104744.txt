organization. university of maine system. from. ryan robbins . subject. re. game length (was re. braves update!!. . . lines. . . umpires are not required to call time out just because a player. asks for time. only in extreme cases, like dust in the pitcher's. or hitter's eyes, should an umpire call time.. . the batter has seconds to get situated in the box and receive. a pitch. i'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock. for that matter) up to count down seconds between pitches and. the minute for warm ups. but i think umpires should tell hitters. to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever, and. instruct the pitcher to pitch. the same goes for pitchers. umps. should tell them to pitch or feint within seconds or a ball. will be called. that's the way it should be.. . . ryan robbins. penobscot hall. university of maine. . io@maine.maine.edu.
