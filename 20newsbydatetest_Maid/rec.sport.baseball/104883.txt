(i know you're another long term braves fan .). . about playing b...imo, that's the nd most difficult position. to field, after catcher. at ss or b, you need more range and . speed, but at b, you've got to have quick reflexes and have . a gun for an arm. there are no second chances at b, even when. playing sandlot softball! granted, i'd still put my best. overall infielder at ss, but that's because he gets more. chances, not because the job is harder. it still amazes me. that so many teams have tried to convert other position players. to b. but maybe that's because the supply of "natural" b is. scarce.. . finally, gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to. perform well, and works hard to improve. you don't get. those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a. lot of weight work. now, whether he's been overdoing it these. days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether. he tries too hard to make something happen during each at bat.. but frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,. i'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not. trying hard enough. you might be able to teach relaxation. to an adult; but at that age i don't believe you can teach. hustle.. . all that said, i don't think i'd sign gant to another long term. contract. he's now, and i think he's free agent eligible. in years, when he'll be . given his career curve and. limitations, i wouldn't expect him to last much past . as a ml ballplayer. he might surprise me here, but atlanta's. got some talent on the farm, and i'd rather take my chances. down the road with nieves et al.. . eric.
