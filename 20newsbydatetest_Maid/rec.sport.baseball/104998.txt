(.). . . everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period. of years that could be used to predict any ability with any . proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the . caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage. that could be dragged out of the data e.g., john lowenstein . probably never had a "clutch" ab against a left handed pitcher,. but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would. be a bias since his clutch abs would be more geared to his . platoon advantage). this is not a subject that has been glanced. at casually. a lot of people have put a lot of effort into . studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the. elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow. you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better. than flipping a coin.
