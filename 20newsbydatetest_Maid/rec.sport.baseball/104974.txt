(the x axis being the +/ deviation in clutch hitting. vs. non clutch; the y axis being the number of players.) certainly. there would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell. my. *supposition* is that if we were to find the same players consistently. (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might. be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players.
