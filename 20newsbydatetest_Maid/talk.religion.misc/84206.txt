from. ash@sumex aim.stanford.edu (david ash). subject. theory on david koresh . originator. dash@xenon.stanford.edu. organization. computer science department, stanford university.. lines. . . my theory is that koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle. and died on day of the siege. on day of the siege he rose from the. dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the fbi over the. next days. living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy,. as timmy baterman's father in *pet*sematary* could attest, so after . days they did what baterman did shot themselves and burned the place. to the ground.. . consistent with the facts, isn't it? did anyone actually *see* koresh. between day and day ?. . david w. ash . "what profits a man if he keeps his eternal soul. ash@sumex aim.stanford.edu . when he could have lived life to the full and. home.
