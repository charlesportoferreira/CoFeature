"israel" at the time.. . and as far as the jews liked the idea of having part of the land you can see. their reaction to the un resolution from november, and the arab's reaction. too (no, it wasn't that the arabs danced in the streets with doznes of jewish. states invading them but quite the other way around).. . bye,. . amos shapira (jumper extraordinaire) .
