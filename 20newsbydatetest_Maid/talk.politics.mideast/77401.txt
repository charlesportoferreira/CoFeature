(p. ) abu hakima continued in his conclusions that ``kuwait . was not a dependency of basra, the persian occupation of basra . ( ) did not affect kuwait.'' (p.) . . kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab . world. this identity was clear to the british and the french who . tried to win the support of kuwait's sheikh between when the . british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the . gulf area. . . . . independent kuwait . . this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the . independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the . ottomans. . . the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the . ottomans in against the wahhabis in eastern arabia (where the oil fields . in saudi arabia now). kuwait and its ruler at that time, sheikh . abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir, allied themselves with the turks.} . . abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. he joined the . expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first . to use its guns against the besieged town of al qatif. had it not been . for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet, al qatif obviously would . not have surrendered in a mere three hours. . . in relation to this, a question arises as to why the ottoman warships . refrained from participating in the bombardment. the answer lies in . reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of . the progress of the expedition. because the ottomans were unwilling to . jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area, the . sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the . war against su'ud or any sheikh in the war zone. kuwait, which was not . a party to the above mentioned treaty of , was under no such . obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against . those who had signed it. . . .
