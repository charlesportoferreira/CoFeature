from. fwrbv@fin.af.mil. subject. xdm and env. vars. organization. the internet. lines. . nntp posting host. enterpoop.mit.edu. to. xpert%expo.lcs.mit.edu@fin.lcs.mit.edu. . hi,. . i am using xdm on xr with ow and xview on suns and sparcs running . sunos ... prior to using xdm, i used to set path and other environment. variables (like manpath, helppath, arch, etc) in my .login file. with xdm,. the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm. root window nor my applications know about these variables.. . i used the "displaymanager. .userpath" resource in /usr/lib/x/xdm/xdm config. to succesfully pass the path variable. but i am having problems passing anything else!!! i tried execing $home/.login in /usr/lib/x/xdm/xsession. but that didn't help. i also tried using. "displaymanager.exportlist. helppath manpath arch". which didn't work either.. . i would appreciate any help on this matter.. . thanks in advance,. shash. . + +. + shash chatterjee email. fwrbv@fin.af.mil +. + ec software phone.
