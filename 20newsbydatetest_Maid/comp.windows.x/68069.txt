from. tan@lynx.msc.cornell.edu.uucp (david tan,box baker lab,,). subject. ignorant imake/xfig question. originator. tan@msc.msc.cornell.edu. organization. cornell materials science center. lines. . . hi folks,. . i'm trying to compile xfig .. on a ss+ running sunos .. and ow .,. and i'm having a little trouble with make/imake. specifically, make bombs. when it needs to use any xaw file. this isn't surprising since x files. on suns with the standard ow . distribution are in various places under. /usr/openwin (xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/x/xaw !!). actually, the real problem is that i know squat about imake, and i don't. know how to tell imake where the x files are. i can see from the . makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the . makefile reads . . # makefile generated by imake do not edit!. . help! is there some way i can edit the imakefile to tell it where to. look? (i have set defines = dopenwin bug, as it said to in the readme. file.). . email and post are both fine.. . thanks in advance,. . dave.
