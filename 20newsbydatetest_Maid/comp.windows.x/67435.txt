from. skelley@umiacs.umd.edu (stephen kelley). subject. xr vs xr configure event handling. organization. umiacs, university of maryland, college park, md . lines. . . repost.. . i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose & configure. events are handled.. . i have an appl. which uses window to draw in. since i give the user the. capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be. resized, i made a translation table for the expose & configure events.. the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event. calls my rescale method. the rescale method invokes a "fake" expose. event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate expose struct). to draw the data.. . quest .. when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r (running in either r or r env.). i get multiple (>) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size. is changed. i assume i'm getting cascading events. is that right?. any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?. . quest .. when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r i get no expose events. whatsoever. do events and/or translation tables act differently in r?. . thanks in advance. . . . . ====================================================================================. steve kelley umcp cs/umiacs captain, i protest!. skelley@umiacs.umd.edu i am *not* a merry man! worf.
