from. brendan@ocs emh.army.mil (brendan mckenna). subject. problems with characters above . organization. the internet. lines. . to. xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu. . . hi all,. . i've read the faq, i've fiddled around, but i am still having problems getting. my poor old hp/ to let me input/display characters above . i have . the following in my .xdefaults.. . xterm*font . adobe courier bold r normal m iso . . so i believe that i have the correct font selected to use in xterm. i have not. set my lc ctype environment variable because whatever i put it, it tells me that. that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,. or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist). i can get some of the characters. above to print out, but they are not where i'd expect them for example,. alt v does not produce a u umlaut. this leads me to believe that the fault. lies with the stty settings, which are as follows.. . speed baud; line = ; susp ; dsusp . intr = ^c; quit = ^\; erase = ^h; kill = ^k; swtch = ^@. eof = ^d; eol = ^@; min = ; time = ; stop = ^s; start = ^q. parenb parodd cs cstopb hupcl cread clocal loblk crts . ignbrk brkint ignpar parmrk inpck istrip inlcr igncr icrnl iuclc . ixon ixany ixoff ienqak . isig icanon iexten xcase echo echoe echok echonl noflsh . opost olcuc onlcr ocrnl onocr onlret ofill ofdel tostop . . anyway, i've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help. anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.. . . thanks!. . brendan.
