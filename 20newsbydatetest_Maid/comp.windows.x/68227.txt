from. mlt@blues.infores.com (michael turok). subject. 'makedepend' problem. organization. information resources inc.. lines. . . hi, netters.. . we have a problem with 'makedepend'. it doesn't know how to correctly process. #if clause in c preprocessor statements. it evaluates everything to. true no matter what the conditionals are.. for example, makedepend chokes on one of x include files (as distributed. by sun) namely xos.h.. . #if !defined(sunos) . defined( stdc ). # include . # define index strchr. # define rindex strrchr. #else /* bsd && ! stdc */. # include . #endif /* !sunos . stdc */. . here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements. to 'true' and tries to open the file which doesn't exist. under solaris.. we also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.. we got and built 'makedepend' off the net it didn't fix the problem.. . in all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man page (sun's. distribution) mentions this problem.. . bugs. if you do not have the source for cpp, the berkeley c. preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way. that all #if directives will evaluate to "true" regardless. of their actual value. this may cause the wrong #include. directives to be evaluated. makedepend should simply have. its own parser written for #if expressions.. . has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than. writeyourownparser... and willing to share it with us?. . since we often experience delays in our newsfeed please reply . directly to my e mail address > i'll post a summary.. . thanks in advance.. ***************************************************************************. * michael turok * *. * information resources, inc. * e mail. mlt@blues.infores.com *. * fifth avenue * voice.
