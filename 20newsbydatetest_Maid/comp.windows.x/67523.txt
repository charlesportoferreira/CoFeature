from. ajaffe@oddjob.uchicago.edu (andrew jaffe). subject. xarchie .. icon problems. organization. university of chicago, astronomy and astrophysics. lines. . . . hi! i've just installed the new xarchie .. and it all works. fine, except.. . on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the. program don't work at all, but on the bw terminal it works fine.. i can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't. give the neat o change when busy action. (other programs with. similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.). . the x interface author, george ferguson, suggests it might be a. problem with the x intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around. to fix it himself. but i know zero about x programming, so i. don't think i can find it. . . does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?. . andrew. . . andrew jaffe ajaffe@oddjob.uchicago.edu. dep't of astronomy and astrophysics, u. chicago. s. ellis ave () . chicago, il () fax.
