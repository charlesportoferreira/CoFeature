from. jvs@jacks.apana.org.au (jack strangio). subject. svr xclients won't work under svr. (repost). organization. prospect , australia. lines. . . when i changed from svr to svr. on my intel box i discovered that. some of my svr xclients such as xload, etc would no longer work.. . . they bomb out with the message.. . error. can't open display unix... . is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries, they need. to be recompiled, or have i not used the correct options?. . both systems use xr.. . thanks.. . jack.. .
