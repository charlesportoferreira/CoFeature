from. jsw@icf.hrb.com (jeffrey s. weber). subject. xview, sun xgl, performance problem. organization. hrb systems, inc.. lines. . . . i've written an application for sparcstation gx+, under openwindows ... . the application uses xview stuff to create my window, and the sun xgl. graphics library for rendering into the canvas.. . the application does real time d animation, but it does not update the. the display fast enough.. i'm using notify set itimer (xview call) to periodically kick off my. update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. i want it to. update times / second. it's only doing about . also, it appears to. be compute bound, because if i run anything else while my appplication is. up, the update rate slows down even more.. . any ideas ?. thanks..
