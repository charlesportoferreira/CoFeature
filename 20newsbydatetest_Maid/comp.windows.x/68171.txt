from. doug@foxtrot.ccmrc.ucsb.edu (douglas scott). subject. help with porting screensaver function. organization. center for computer music research and composition, u.c.s.b.. lines. . . this is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking.. . . . i am attempting to add a working savescreen function to a new. server. i have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through. debugging i can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=,. which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.. . my problem is that this function is never being called again with on=, even. after i have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys. my question is. what am. i likely to be missing that would cause this problem? i copied the basic. design of my function from the existing versions.. . static bool next savescreen(scr,on). screenptr scr;. bool on;. {. . /* this was copied from the omron server code is it the right way? */. if (on != screen saver on) {. nextsetlasteventtime();. }. . if (on == screen saver on) { /* save user's current setting */. next save screen brightness = nxscreenbrightness(my eventhandle);. nxsetscreenbrightness( my eventhandle, .); /* blank the screen */. }. else { /* unblank the screen */. nxsetscreenbrightness( my eventhandle, next save screen brightness);. }. . return true;. }. . i can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the. saver, but i cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the. screen.. . any tips/help would be appreciated.. . thanks.. . . . douglas scott () . center for computer music research and composition. university of california, santa barbara. internet.
