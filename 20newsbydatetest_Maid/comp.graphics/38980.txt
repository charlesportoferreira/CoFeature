'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes. up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however,. even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.. (americans. the lift is just an example .). . . well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to. read it.. . . juhana kouhia.
