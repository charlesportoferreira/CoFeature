from. kiki@problem with inews gateway file (keith baccki). subject. re. bit graphics.... organization. computer science department, boston university, boston, ma, usa. lines. . x newsreader. tin [version . pl]. . wonko the sane (oehler@yar.cs.wisc.edu) wrote.. . . i was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! . ) ) and he made a reference to a. . bit graphics computer/image processing system. i seem to remember it being called image or. . something akin to that. anyway, he claimed it had bit color + a bit alpha channel. that's. . bits of info what could that possibly be for? specifically the bit color? that's . . trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve. is this an anti aliasing thing? or. . is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.. . . i'm pretty sure most industry strength image processing specific . systems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as bits of color info.. why? why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the. hardware's only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographers. demand professional results.. . . also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are sgi's flagship products? i know of. . iris, indigo, and crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top of the line?. . (sadly, i have access to none of them. just a dec /. sigh.). . strange question, but anyway, there's the vgx line, the newer. indigo^, and the onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (you. can get a processor system with twice the graphics performance of. a reality engine). there's more, but i don't have my handy "periodic . table of sgi's" on me.... . . keith. .
