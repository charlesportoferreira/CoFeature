sorry, i don't understand what you are saying here. i am aware that english is. not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this. paragraph defeats me.. . >gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image. >as i presented. there's no need make tricks from bit/quantized image. >back to bit image.. . yes *as i originally said*, global changes are easily possible.. . but this statement contradicts what you said earlier. . . >>>i wrote something about making color modifications quickly. >>>with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file. >>>process we have to make the modifications to the bit image.. . . . >>>>how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file? how. >>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? only global. >>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and. >>>>much more complicated.. . >ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as bit. >and user want edit individual colors your questions, by the way,. >jumps off the discussion a bit.. . no i don't think so actually. . . you were talking about loading a bit image into xv (by quantising),. manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these. changes to the bit file when you exit xv. xv lets you edit individual. colours. where is this sudden jumping off the topic?. . >my solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real bit. >image . . yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a bit file!!. . > you see, user see bit image; going back to bit is silly.. . i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.. . >about changing individual colors in bit/quantized/rasterized image.. >changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most. >cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may. >make serious errors to anywhere in the image.. . ???. what are you saying. ???. . >xv allows this feature, but i don't recommend to use it with the. >mentioned type images.. . ah! now we see thew problem! first you want to extend xv to allow editing of . bit previews of bit images. then i point out problems with this. now you are. saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those. parts of the program that cause the problem!!. . . >moreover, xv is not a paint program; you can only make those global. >changes. . . not sure what you are saying here. certainly one can make local changes.. . >in full bit xv, changing individual colors sounds like. >paint program job.. >if person have bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the. >original bit image modified. because user don't see full bit. >image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to. >modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if. >image is rasterized). to select indiavidual color, there could be x. >cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area . >selecting individual color is possible from that.. . yes that is one possible approach. i would find a program that took such an. approach clumsy, however.. . >ok, i don't have thought very much bit painting programs, never seen. >such in good view and are not planned to make such. not to mention. >bit painting program in bit screen.... . well here we agree you have not thought it through very much. you don't seem. to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the. next. ok, we all have off days perhaps you should step back and think this one. through.. . >>yes again. what *is* (was?) wrong with xv?. . >it saved bit/quantized/rasterized images as bit jpegs; jpeg is not. >designed for that.. . as i said in the last post, jpeg is a compression algorithm. it is a way of. saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. i fail to see what. the problem is. you have not proposed any workable alternatives.. . >also, human expect that bit will be saved as bit image; . . speak for yourself. you are the *only* person i have met or spoken to who,. having quantised a bit image down to bits, expects this process to somehow. reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made. to the bit image palette.. . perhaps that is why you yused the singular?. . >say,. >person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is. >expected that the image still is the same. . . look, next time you import a bit image into xv look carefully at the main. control panel it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the bit. image. xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original bit. file. you are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.. . >so, xv were designed. >without thinking about human interface and how human expect the. >program work design error.. . is a design error the same as a bug? ; ). . read my lips. xv is a program for viewing and modifying bit images. it lets. you import other images. it shows, i would say, a good deal of thought about the. human interface. and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it. was designed for. it makes no false claims.. . >i have heard xv were designed first for bit images/files, but. >it were not good idea to take full bit images without making. >major change to the original design.. . if you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of. precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. so . far, you have not done so.. . >so, even all screen images are bit, the processed images and saved. >images could have been bit very easily, instead of bit.. . argh!! after all this, a comment like that. `very easily'. ok, go ahead and code it. if it is so easy.. . or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non reversible transformation'.. . >before anybody will make a note. yes, i may as well make a lift where. >'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes. >up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however,. >even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.. >(americans. the lift is just an example .). . i think this is a bit of an exageration.. . what you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in. the states ; ) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. everyone else. had no problem. now you are trying to sue the manufacturer.... . >well, my text may be a bit hard reading, . . you bet. . >hopefully you suggeeded to. >read it.. . mostly. leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly. thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. go think. some more.. . . chris lilley. . technical author, itti computer graphics and visualisation training project. computer graphics unit, manchester computing centre, oxford road, . manchester, uk. m pl internet. c.c.lilley@mcc.ac.uk . voice. + () fax. + () janet. c.c.lilley@uk.ac.mcc. .
