from. rgab@vm.univie.ac.at. subject. tel.# for d scanners needed!. organization. university of vienna. lines. . nntp posting host. helios.edvz.univie.ac.at. . hello all,. i need to make some torso d scans and would like the phone numbers of. companies in the midwest that make scans, and the numbers of companies that. make the sanners (ie cyberware). does anyone have an idea of how much a. single scan costs and the best format to save it in? i am not sure on what. software platform i will be using it in, probably either softimage or. wavefront. so i think a spline based format would be best. please forward the. numbers to me personally as i am having problems accessing usenet lately.. thanks in advance!. . patrick maun. rgab@awiuni.edvz.univie.ac.at. st. paul mn.
