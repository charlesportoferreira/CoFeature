"a fast algorithm for raster. rotation", by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) graphics. interface ' (vancouver). an article on the im toolkit appears in. the same journal. an updated version of

.... . please do *not* post or mail messages saying "i can't ftp, could someone. mail this to me?" there are a number of automated mail servers that will. send you things like this in response to a message. see item below for. details on some.. . also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion. of software like this. you may find useful information there.. . . ) format documents for tiff, iff, biff, nff, off, fits, etc.. . you almost certainly don't need these. read the above item on free. image manipulation software. get one or more of these packages and. look through them. chances are excellent that the image converter you. were going to write is already there. but if you still want one of the. format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from. zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.. . these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.. this archive includes pixel formats, and two and three dimensional object. formats. the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as mark. hall will apparently no longer be maintaining it.. . a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained. by quincey koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu). the latest version exists at. ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats. apparently,. neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.. . fits stands for flexible image transport system. it's a file format most. often used in astronomy. despite the name, it can contain not only images. but other things as well. there is a regular monthly fits basics and. information posting on sci.astro.fits read it if you want to know more.. . . . ) converting between vector formats.. . a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript, or macdraw. to cgm, or whatever. it is important to understand that this is a very. different problem from the image format conversions in item . converting. one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you. get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel the basic objects. are the same for all image formats. this is not so for vector formats.. the basic objects circles, ellipses, drop shadowed pattern filled. round cornered rectangles, etc. vary from one format to another.. except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do. a one to one conversion between vector formats.. . there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp.psc.edu. the. contributor states that it runs on unix, ms windows, and possibly the mac.. a better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.. . on the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,. rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.. as far as i know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such. converters, but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been. posted to comp.sources.misc. check the index on your nearest archive. site.. . a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format. to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format, or hpgl to. x bitmap. for example, some of the commercial postscript clones for. pc's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer. also,. the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun's x/news can. be used to render to a file if you're clever. but in general, the. answer is no. however, if someone were to put together a vector to. vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be. trivial.. . gnu ghostscript (from the fsf current version ..) includes. drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as. a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter. (it implements. essentially all of postscript level and alot of display postscript. and level ).. . . ) how to get pixar films.. . the various john lasseter / pixar computer animated shorts are available. on video tape. you can order them from direct cinema limited.. . film individual price institutional price. luxo, jr. $. $.. red's dream $. $.. tin toy $. $.. knickknack $. $.. luxo, jr./red's dream/tin toy $. $.. . all tapes are on /" vhs ntsc. add $/tape for pal format. also. available.. . tin toy t shirt $.. knickknack d t shirt $.
