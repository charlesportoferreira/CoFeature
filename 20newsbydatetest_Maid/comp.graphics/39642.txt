() introduction.. this program can let you read, write and display images with different. formats. it also let you do some special effects(rotation, dithering ....). on image. its main purpose is to let you convert image among different. formts.. include simple file management system.. support 'slide show'.. + support 'batch conversion'.. there is no limit on image size.. currently this program supports , , , bits display.. if you want to use hicolor or truecolor, you must have vesa driver.. if you want to modify video driver, please read section ().. . . () hardware requirement.. pc or better. msdos . or higher.. min amount of ram is m bytes(maybe less memory will also work).. (i recommend min m bytes for better performance).. hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).. . the following description is borrowed from djgpp.. . supported wares.. . * up to m of extended memory (expanded under vcpi). * up to m of disk space used for swapping. * supervga color mode up to x. * . * xms & vdisk memory allocation strategies. * vcpi programs, such as qemm, desqview, and max. . unsupported.. . * dpmi. * microsoft windows. . features. emulator, bit unix ish environment, flat memory. model, svga graphics.. . . () installation.. video drivers, emu and go.exe are borrowed from djgpp.. (if you use western digital vga chips, read readme.wd). (this go.exe is a modified version for vesa and is completely compatible. with original version). *** but some people report that this go.exe is not compatible with. other djgpp programs in their system. if you encounter this problem,. don't put go.exe within search path.. . *** please read runme.bat for how to run this program.. . if you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc ' to environment. go.. . for example, go=driver x./xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc . . if you don't have x, add 'emu x./xxxxx/emu' to environment go.. . for example, go=driver x./xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x./xxxxx/emu. . **** notes. . i only test tr.grn, et.grn and vesa.grn.. other drivers are not tested.. . i have modified et.grn to support , , , bits. display. you don't need to use vesa driver.. if et.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.. . for those who want to use hicolor or truecolor display,. please use vesa.grn(except et users).. you can find vesa bios driver from .. wuarchive.wustl.edu. /mirrors/msdos/graphics. godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au. /kjb/mgl. . .

'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.. the header line in 'read' menu includes "(d.xx,f.xx,t.xx)".. d . display type. f. number of files. t. number of tagged files.. pressing space in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use. for reading current file.. pressing return in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. this. program will automatically determine which format this file is.. the procedure is. first, check magic number. if fail, check. standard extension. still fail, report error.. pressing s or s in 'read' menu will do 'slide show'.. if delay time is , program will wait until you hit a key. (except escape).. if any error occurs, program will make a beep.. + 'w' or 'w' to pause, any key to continue.. escape to terminate.. pressing ins in 'read' menu will change display type.. pressing alt x in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.. + pressing f will turn on 'effect' menu.. . . once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.. you can do special effect on image.. pressing return. show image.. in graphic mode, press return, space or escape to return to text. mode.. pressing tab. change processing target. this program allows you to do. special effects on bit or bit image.. pressing left,right arrow. change display type. , , , bits.. pressing space. save current image to file.. b/w dither. save as black/white image( bit).. grey scale. save as grey image( bits).. full color. save as color image( bits).. true color. save as bit image.. . this program will ask you some questions if you want to write image. to file. some questions are format dependent. finally this program. will prompt you a filename. if you want to save file under another. directory other than current directory, please press space. after. pressing space, you will enter 'write' menu. you can change. directory to what you want. then,. . pressing space. this program will prompt you 'original' filename.. pressing return. this program will prompt you 'selected' filename. (filename under bar).. . . . this program supports , , , bits display.. . . this program is memory greedy. if you don't have enough memory,. the performance is poor.. . . if you want to save bits image .. try gif then tiff(lzw) then targa then sun raster then bmp then .... . if you want to save bits image (lossless).. try tiff(lzw) or targa or ilbm or sun raster. (no one is better for true bits image). . . i recommend jpeg for storing bits images, even bits images.. . . not all subroutines are fully tested. . . this document is not well written. if you have any problem, suggestion,. comment about this program,. please send to u@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (...).. i need your suggestion to improve this program.. (there is no anonymous ftp on this site). . . () tech. information.. program (user interface and some subroutines) written by jih shin ho.. some subroutines are borrowed from xv(.) and pbmplus(dec ).. tiff(v.) and jpeg(v) reading/writing are through public domain. libraries.. compiled with djgpp.. you can get whole djgpp package from simtel or mirror sites.. for example, wuarchive.wustl.edu. /mirrors/msdos/djgpp. . .
