(both ms dos and unix) and i'm generating targa files of varying size.. . ) ok, so i can view these wonderful pictures on my screen. what's the best way to get them on to paper? would it be possible to take it to kinko's and have them make an actual picture on paper from it?. . ) i was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced . frames. is this a bad idea? any tricks to it?. . . . ). how would i get a sequence of targa files made into an animation . that i could put on a videotape? is there a cheap way?.
