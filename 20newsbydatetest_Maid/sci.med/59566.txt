from. calzone@athena.mit.edu. subject. legality of placebos?. organization. massachusetts institute of technology. lines. . distribution. world. nntp posting host. w .mit.edu. . . . how is it that placebos are legal? it would seem to me that if, as a patient,. you purchase a drug you've been prescribed and it's just sugar (or whatever),. there's a few legal complications that arise.. . . . if you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren't given accepted. treatment for it, it seems like intentional medical malpractice.. . .. a placebo should fall, legally, under the label of quackery (why not?). . .. getting what you pay for. (deceptive "bait and switch" to an extreme...). false. advertising (what if mcdonalds didn't put % pure beef in their hamburgers?). . . so i'm mystified. are these assumptions erred? if they aren't, why the. hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo?. . thanks. calzone.
