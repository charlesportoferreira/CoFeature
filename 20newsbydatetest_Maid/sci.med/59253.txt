from. noring@netcom.com (jon noring). subject. adenocarcinoma of the lungs. organization. netcom online communications services ( login. guest). lines. . . putting aside our substantial differences, i'd like to ask the knowledgeable. ones to give feedback on this. let me explain.. . one of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after. having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is years old).. otherwise, she is in fine health. the discovery was made via cat scans.. . she then had mri scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered. in her lungs. biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma. one spot is. in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax. the oncologists believe. the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked. until four years ago).. . anyway, i'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different. from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right. below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are. the chances for full remission/recovery?. . thanks.. . jon noring. . . . charter member >>> infj club.. . if you're dying to know what infj means, be brave, e mail me, i'll send info.. =============================================================================. . jon noring . noring@netcom.com . .. . jkn international . ip . ... . fred's gourmet chocolate .. . carlton place . phone .
