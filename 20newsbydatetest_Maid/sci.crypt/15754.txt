(the exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale. products that. sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell. thousands of units/year will be at the high end. i suspect cellular phones. are in the middle). this implies that adding a $ chip would increase the. cost of the phone by approx $, or about % %.. . i don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.. . . tony. . >>usual disclaimer<<.
