(here i have assumed that the. des encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed. is this so or do. the modifications of the s boxes by the salt bits make it non reversable?). . * probably there is only one key; i think there is chance in about . that there are two or more keys (can anyone verify this?), but this doesn't. help the cracker much.. .
