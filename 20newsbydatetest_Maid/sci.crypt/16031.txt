(kd[], kd[]). . assumptions.. no trap doors in e(), d() and h(). h() is not invertible.. . algorithms for e(), d() and h() are secret. otherwise a software. implementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip.. . the chip only supports the following operation.. . ) return n[]. ) load k[x]. ) return e(k[x], u[x]). ) return e(n[] + l[] + ... + l[a], f). ) given e(n[] + l[] + ... + l[a], f),. return n[],l[],...,l[a]. ) load k[]. ) given e(n[] + l[] + ... + l[a], f),. compute ke[], kd[]. ) given m, return e(m, ke[]). ) given m, return d(m, kd[]). . anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying. the chip (u[],...,u[a],f,n[]).. . u[],...,u[a] can not be determined except by destroying the chip.. (unfortunately this may not be true in reality. i suppose it's. possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a. sophisticated[sp?] x ray machine to look for blown fuses.). . the u's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.. . notes.. for tapping escrow agency y is given n[], e(k[y], u[y]), n[],. e(k[y], u[y]) and returns k[y], k[y].. . lea's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from. both chips and the encrypted partial keys. this allows the agencies. to record that both chips were tapped.. . lea's only get the session key, not the key to all conversations. of a particular chip. this precludes real time decrypting of a. conversation but that isn't one of the stated requirements.. . observation.. in order for any secure by "tap able" communication scheme to work,. the active parts need to share a secret. and if this secret is. revealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made. "un tap able". obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm. and the master (family) key. relative size and complexity suggests. that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the. scheme a lot easier and faster than the algorithm.. . . rsbx. . . raymond s. brand rbrand@usasoc.soc.mil. .
