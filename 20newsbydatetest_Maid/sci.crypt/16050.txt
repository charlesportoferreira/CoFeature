("e(n;f)" is not syntactically different than "n"), all they. have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of. today's target and use the serial number to identify the. session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of. the conversation. even without the key, this is great for. traffic analysis. i can think of several ways to learn the. right serial number.. . it looks like one intended effect of the clipper is to. eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to. cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your. alligator clips erect). this is particularly handy if you have. s and s.. . btw, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial. number?. . cheers,. marc. . . marc thibault . marc@tanda.isis.org. automation architect . cis.,. r.r., oxford mills, ontario, canada . nc freenet. aa. . begin pgp public key block . mqbnaiqxytkaaaecalfehypycsscfvjspjescao+hihtnefrrn+vuecsavh. aauwpiugyvnn+lftpnnlcms+cpjupykviabrgihcmmgvghpymfbhqg. pghcmnadgfuzgeuaxnpcyvcmc+. =hlnv. end pgp public key block . .
