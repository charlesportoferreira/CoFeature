from. c@mizzou.missouri.edu (john kelsey). subject. re. implementing a diffie hellman key exchange.. nntp posting host. mizzou.missouri.edu. organization. university of missouri. lines. . . you should probably use numbers much larger than bits. also, you. may want to include some randomly generated bitstrings in your protocol.. this way, if someone should find the shared key you and another person. use on one day, they won't be able to guess it for the next day..... . ie a sends g**a mod p and random string r. b sends g**b mod p and random string r. . both find (g**a mod p)** b mod p = shared key, then both calculate. . session key = hash(r,shared key, r). . also, you will want to make sure that you're getting the right public. key value g**a mod p. someone with the power to intercept and change messages. can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you *his* public key, and then. acquiring a session key with each of you..... . john.
