(if so, why use. bit keys?) not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm, it's. not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to. guess s,s.. . why are n, n, and n formed as they are? it would be facinating to. see the skipjack algorithm, to look for ways of attacking it that require. three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.. . where do the bit constant values that are concatenated with the. serial number to form n,n,n come from? are they changed from chip to. chip, or session to session? (even if they're published in the ny times,. if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks, when using triple . encryption, then there's no break in security. but why allow that kind. of weird format? if those three bit values are truly random bits, then. maybe it's used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack, if. it exists, can't be easily used to derive s and s for a whole production. run of these chips....). . does dorothy denning read this group? if not, is someone on the group. forwarding questions like these to her, or martin hellman, or anyone else. who's seen more details about the chip?. . john kelsey.
