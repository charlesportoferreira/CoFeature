"wild." while that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital. billboards aren't the problem. they are just a symptom of . growing, densely populated civilization. banning such ads will. not save your view of the night sky, because by the time . such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble. finding a place without street lights, where you can see . the stars.... . the rest of your post is strange mishmash of "its already really bad". and "it doesn't really matter if it gets worse." you should try to. figure out what you are really arguing for.
