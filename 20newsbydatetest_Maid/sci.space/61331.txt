"communications satellite handbook" has a graph of sky temperature vs.. wavelength, in fact, for communications design.. . however, in terms of energy content, the rf frequencies are negligible.. for thermal purposes, at very large distances from the sun the sky. looks like a black body at .k (allen, "astrophysical quantities").. i haven't found a number for non large distances, since solar radiation. tends to be something you can't just ignore . ), but m&g says "about k". in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem.. . svr resembles a high speed collision . henry spencer @ u of toronto zoology. between svr and sunos. dick dunn . henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo!henry.
