from. david.anderman@ofa.fidonet.org. subject. $bil space race ideas/moon base on the cheap.. x sender. newtout . feb . lines. . . although the $ billion scheme is a fantasy (it's an old canard in the space. business called "trolling for billionaires"), there is a good chance that a. much smaller program ($ million) will pass the rd congress. this is the. back to the moon bill, put together by the people who passed the launch. services purchase act. the bill would incent private companies to develop. lunar orbiters, with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding.. there is an aggregate cap on the bids of $ million.. . having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably. worse than having the government bankroll a $ million program, as the delta. clipper program has shown (dc x was funded by sdio at $ million). we have a. clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade as opposed to. simply wishing for our dreams to come true. please support the back to the. moon bill.. . for more information, please send e mail with your u.s. postal service. address.. . maximus .wb.
