'course, most of your electric guitar types just say. "tubes sound better, dude." . ). . also, transistors have the advantage in both waste heat and energy use,. mainly because of the heaters on the cathodes of the tubes.. . tommy mac. . tom mcwilliams wk \\ as the radius of vision increases,. tm@ibm.cl.msu.edu hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows.. .
