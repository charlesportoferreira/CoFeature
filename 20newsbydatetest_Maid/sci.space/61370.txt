(don't forget the "binary" mode!), but you can't "ls" in the. "/incoming" directory.. . a further update. mark's design made the cover of space news this week. as one of the design alternatives which was rejected. but he's still. in there plugging. i wish him luck using et's as the basis of a. space station has been a good idea for a long time.. . may the best design win.. . ken jenks, nasa/jsc/gm, space shuttle program office. kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov () . .
