(but closer than mpc). i dunno sn theory so well, but i can't think. of how to get many gammas out. maybe i should look it up.. . big radio galaxies can put out ^ erg/s *continually*. that's just. in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but "bursts"?. nah.. . neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show. that those energies *are* produced by things we know about.. . . greg. . . . .
