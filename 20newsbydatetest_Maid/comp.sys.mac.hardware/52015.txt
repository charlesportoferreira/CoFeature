(by the way, all matlab software was on class accounts. i was also the. ta for a class that used simulab/simulink. we had site license and. take home, then destroy later site release licenses... no pirating. there, incase you're wondering.... great program!!! ). . just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never. get enuff memory.... buy it while it's cheap that is buy it when you. get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... i always. run out of disk space... but i have a syquest on the mac iisi, so i. never worried about space before... got several carts).. . shishin "squish" yamada. squish@endor.harvard.edu. . . . .
