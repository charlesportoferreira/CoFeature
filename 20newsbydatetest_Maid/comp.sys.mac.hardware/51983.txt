() . . i believe the fpu on the lciii is always supposed to go on the logic. board, not in the pds board. i have heard of crashing problems with. pds based fpus on the lciii. asante may have fixed them but why. bother. why bother building an lciii card with an fpu anyway? the. extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. i say fpu on. main logic board, in socket, ethernet alone on pds card, in slot.. . . mark.
