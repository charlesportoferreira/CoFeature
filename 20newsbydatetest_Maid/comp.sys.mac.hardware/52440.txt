from. goyal@utdallas.edu (mohit k goyal). subject. data transfer rate of the new series fs micropolis hd's. nntp posting host. apache.utdallas.edu. organization. univ. of texas at dallas. lines. . . i have a question for y'all.. . i'm looking at an ad for the new ." fast scsi drives from micropolis. in the june, , macworld. (i have seen similar ads for the ide versions. in ibm pc magazines). . well, the ad says that all three drives have a fast scsi interface,. but then it says that the dtr rate for each drive is megabytes/second,. *max*.. . how can this be? i thought that if a drive was to be fast scsi it. had to have a dtr of megs a second?. . (i am assuming the megs/sec claim by micropolis is from the k cache.. i admit that i would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data. at megs a second!). . thank you.. .
