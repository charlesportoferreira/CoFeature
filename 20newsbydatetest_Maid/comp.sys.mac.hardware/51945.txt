from. mdavis@crash.cts.com (morgan davis). subject. iici rom offers bit clean rom for iix. organization. cts network services (crash, ctsnet), el cajon, ca. lines. . . . last week's macweek article by ric ford indicated that david ramsey's. mac iix has been running nicely with a mac iici rom in it, offering. clean bit rom code (liberating his iix from the virtual memory. nightmare caused by apple's bit system enabler).. . does anyone know of a source for these roms? is it okay for a. remanufacturer to resell only rom chips from used machines? i know that. copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to. resell the original used rom. (after all, reselling a used computer. involves the sale of the rom anyway, so what's the difference?).. . needless to say, i'm interested in purchasing such a rom. what would. be a reasonably price to offer?. . /\/\ morgan davis group (/ ). / / \ internet. mdavis@crash.cts.com.
