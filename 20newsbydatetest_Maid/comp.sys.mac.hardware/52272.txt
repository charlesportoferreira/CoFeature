(*sigh), montgomery wards, silo (*sigh), circuit city (*sigh*) and. bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $.. why i chose one over the. other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who. went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who. sells apples?). admittedly, except for montgomery wards (and i. suspect i was just lucky) all of the salesfolk i spoke to didn't know. didly about the computers, peecee or mac. but then, neither did any. of the apple dealers i spoke with.... . if you would've told me a year ago that i would buy a macintosh from. montgomery wards i woulda laughed for a long, long time. go figure.. i'm *real* happy with my performa. oh, and i bought the apple. performa plus monitor (vs. buying rd party). happy with that. decision as well. i walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out. with a spankin' new computer the day before christmas. . . . instrument approach procedures automation dot/faa/ami . . bryan d. oakley ctrbdo%iapa@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu.
