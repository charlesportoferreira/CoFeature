() the iisi *cannot* supply a vga output. however.... . () some vga type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal. the mac uses to drive the apple or inch "high resolution color. display" i.e., apple's own x mode.. . so, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your iisi, you. need (a) an adapter that converts from the mac db connector to the. vga style high density db connector, *but* tells the mac to use. it's own x mode, not the vga x mode, and (b) a vga monitor. that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the mac x mode over. the vga x mode (which as i stated in () above, the iisi cannot. produce).. . as far as (a) above is concerned, contact. . james engineering, inc.. fairmount ave.. el cerrito, ca . . fax. . . they can probably get you the right adapter. remember. you do *not*. want the run of the mill mac to vga adapter, because it will try to. have your iisi produce the vga mode, which it cannot (the computer. will just fail to produce any video signal at all). instead, you want. an adapter that connects between the mac style and vga style. connectors, but tells the mac to use the apple x mode. sorry. for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.. . as far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal. with a horizontal bandwidth of khz and a vertical retrace rate of. hz. these are the spec's of apple's x mode. for comparison,. the vga standard x mode uses a . khz horizontal bandwidth and. a hz. vertical retrace rate.. . the monitor will probably need to have auto synch'ing capability, as. the apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes. in the pc compatible world.. . good luck!. . fred martin. . . . fred martin . fredm@media.mit.edu .
