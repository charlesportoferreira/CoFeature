(i'm looking for. things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected,. and the pin outs for those chips.). . is a board with the re work any different functionally from one without?. . could the re worked boards be incompatible with future releases of. the operating system?. . and, finally,. . . should i even be concerned about any of this?. . . . keith folsom. folsom@cup.portal.com.
