from. chrisw@yang.earlham.edu. subject. accelerated mac plus problems. organization. earlham college, richmond, indiana. lines. . . hello. i recently accelerated my mac plus (micromac mhz accelerator) . and now i can't get my mac to boot off of the hard disk. it boots fine . from a floppy, and i can mount the hard disk using scsi probe, but i . cannot get it to boot from the hard drive. i installed a new driver, so i . don't think that is the problem. . this poses a rather large problem. i only have meg of ram, and . i need to run mathematica, which requires meg. i was hoping to use . system virtual memory so that i could run mathematica. however, i can't . run system from a floppy, so i can't get enough ram. . any suggestions? thanks for your time . chrisw@yang.earlham.edu.
