subject. re. monitors should they be kept on hours a day???. from. stubbs@hawk.cs.ukans.edu (jerry stubbs). organization. university of kansas computer science dept. lines. . . . >yes, i know computers and harddisk drives should be always on. but what about. >monitors? they generate a lots of heat. should i or shouldn't i keep them on. > hours a day? any advice? thanks. take care...paul. . . i vote for turning them off at night. the stress of off/on is a little . harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but. turning them off for hours or overnight is a good idea.. . the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along. with heat. . . we have a lot of year old machines in the basement that still work, but. who cares? (they are off hours a day).. . .
