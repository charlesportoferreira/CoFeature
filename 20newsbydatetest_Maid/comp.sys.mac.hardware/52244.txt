(a company i know little about other than that they are a longtime. player in mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). the nec. cdr is also a good choice (nec's own mechanism, i think). clubmac. sells it for around $.. . >thanx.. . your welcome, ooh but now i see your from germany. most of the. mailorder info does you little good, i guess. if not.. spin peripherals . club mac . relax tech . . nothing wrong with the apple, though, which is based on a sony. mechanism and speed identical to the nec. the toshiba's speed. advantage is very slight. % in average access time (a minor plus). and % in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).. . good luck,. mark.
