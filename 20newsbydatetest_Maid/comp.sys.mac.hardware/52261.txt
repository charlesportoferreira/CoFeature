from. mfeldman@bu.edu (michael feldman). subject. floptical kills superdrive. lines. . x newsreader. tin . pl. . i recently bought a pli mgbyte floptical drive, and i was very happy . with it until i tried to use it to format a . hd diskette. i put the. hd floppy in my superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it. correctly, and now my superdrive refuses to recognize any floppy (it says. "this disk is unreadable" and asks if i want to format it) even original. systems floppies from apple. nor will it format the disks if i try to. ("initialization failed!") strangely enough the floptical still reads. both the mb and . hd disks, but i cant look at my k floppies, and. if i have a crash i'm screwed because the floptical can't be used as a. start up disk. pli has been unresponsive. any ideas? has this happened. to anyone before? i was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and. now i am looking at an expensive repair. help! respond to this thread, or. email mfeldman@acs.bu.edu.
