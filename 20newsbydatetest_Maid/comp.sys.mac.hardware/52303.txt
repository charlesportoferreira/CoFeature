(erik adams) writes.. + i am looking at a new lc iii and a used iici. prices. . + the iici has much greater potential for expansion, a la nubus and. + greater memory capacity.. . how important is this? how many nubus cards do you have/plan to. acquire? how much memory do you really need? i've got a ci, and. mb of ram. that's plenty. i also have a bit graphics card. on the nubus i'm a sucker for pretty pictures...i think the. lciii can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can. not have. at least, not out of the box.. . + the lc iii would be new, under warranty, newer roms (is the iici. + " bit clean"?), and would have sound input. i also like the. + "pizza box" case.. . the ci is bit clean. i solved the sound input problem with. a macrecorder. but that's gotten to be a fairly expensive. solution now that macromind owns macrecorder.. . + performance wise, i have read that they are almost identical, the. + lc iii being a little slower.. . the actual difference is probably not worth worrying over.. . + so, which should i get?. . depends on the price you can get the ci for. educationally speaking,. the / [?] lciii here at fsu can be had at just under $. add. in roughly $ for a monitor. last i'd heard, an mb lciii simm. went for ~$. . . i think you're in a win win situation. no matter what you decide,. you'll most likely be happy with it.. . james.
