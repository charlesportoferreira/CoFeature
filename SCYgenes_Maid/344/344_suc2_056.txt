synergistic release from glucose repression by mig and ssn mutations in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose repression of suc transcription requires the ssn tup repressor complex. it has been proposed that the dna binding protein mig secures ssn tup to the suc promoter. here we show that a mig deletion does not cause nearly as dramatic a loss of repression as ssn. glucose grown mig mutants display fold lower suc expression than ssn mutants. thus, repression by ssn tup is not mediated solely by mig, but also involves mig independent mechanisms. we report that mig partially restores suc expression in mutants lacking the snf protein kinase and show that mig is allelic to ssn, a mutation selected as a suppressor of snf. other ssn genes identified in this selection were therefore candidates for a role in repression of suc. we show that mig acts synergistically with ssn through ssn, ssn, and ssn to relieve glucose repression of suc and to suppress the requirement for snf. these findings indicate that the ssn proteins contribute to repression of suc, and the pleiotropic phenotypes of the ssn mutants suggest global roles in repression. finally, the regulated suc expression observed in snf mig mutants indicates that signals regarding glucose availability can be transmitted independently of the snf protein kinase.
