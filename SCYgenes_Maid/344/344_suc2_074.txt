the snf, snf and snf genes are required for ty transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae snf, snf and snf genes were initially identified as genes required for expression of suc and other glucose repressible genes. the suc defect in all three of these classes of mutants is suppressed by mutations in the spt gene. since mutations in spt had also been identified as suppressors of ty and solo delta insertion mutations at the his and lys loci, we have examined ty transcription in snf, snf and snf mutants and have found that ty transcription is abolished or greatly reduced. the snf, snf and snf defect for ty transcription, like the defect for suc transcription, is suppressed by spt mutations. in contrast to other mutations that abolish or greatly reduce ty transcription (in the spt, spt and spt genes), mutations in these snf genes do not cause suppression of insertion mutations. this result suggests that the snf, snf and snf gene products act by a distinct mechanism from the spt, spt and spt gene products to promote transcription of ty elements. this result also suggests that a reduction of ty transcription is not always sufficient for activation of adjacent gene expression.
