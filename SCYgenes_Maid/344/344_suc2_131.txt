microheterogeneity in yeast invertase.. . yeast external invertase (ec ...), a glycoenzyme consisting of equal parts by weight of protein and mannan, has been found to contain covalently bound phosphate. three preparations (from two yeast strains) had mannose/po ratios of , equivalent to po residues per mol of enzyme, while a fourth had only po residues per mol. from one of the high po enzymes, approx. % of the phosphorus was recovered as mannose phosphate. no correlation was found between invertase activity and phosphorus content. the po contents of the invertases exceeded those of the cell wall mannans from the respective yeasts. thus, contamination of the invertases by cell wall phosphomannan is unlikely. electrofocusing of the low po invertase yielded four components with pi values from . to ., and yeast internal invertase (a mannan and po free, cytoplasmic isozyme) was isoelectric at approx. ph .. the high po invertase was considerably more heterogeneous, with two major species of pi . and . and a highly acidic component of pi smaller than .; however, the mannose/po ratio of each species was approximately the same. po gradient elution from hydroxyapatite resolved the high po invertase into five isozymes of increasing acidity and mannan content. since the mannose/po ratios of these invertase species are constant, the increase in the mannan/protein (and, therefore po/protein ratio is apparently responsible for the microheterogeneity of phosphoinvertase.
