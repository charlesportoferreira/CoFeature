interaction of the repressors nrg and nrg with the snf protein kinase in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the snf protein kinase is essential for the transcription of glucose repressed genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. we identified nrg as a protein that interacts with snf in the two hybrid system. nrg is a c()h() zinc finger protein that is homologous to nrg, a repressor of the glucose and snf regulated sta (glucoamylase) gene. snf also interacts with nrg in the two hybrid system and co immunoprecipitates with both nrg and nrg from cell extracts. a lexa fusion to nrg represses transcription from a promoter containing lexa binding sites, indicating that nrg also functions as a repressor. an nrg fusion to green fluorescent protein is localized to the nucleus, and this localization is not regulated by carbon source. finally, we show that vp fusions to nrg and nrg allow low level expression of suc in glucose grown cells, and we present evidence that nrg and nrg contribute to glucose repression of the dog gene. these results suggest that nrg and nrg are direct or indirect targets of the snf kinase and function in glucose repression of a subset of snf regulated genes.
