the gam/snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a highly charged nuclear protein required for transcription of the sta gene.. . we have cloned and sequenced the gam gene which is required for transcription of the sta gene encoding an extracellular glucoamylase in saccharomyces cerevisiae var. diastaticus. complementation tests indicated that gam is the same gene as snf which is required for derepression of the suc gene encoding invertase. accumulation of snf rna was not regulated by the gam and gam genes which are also required for sta expression. the snf gene was predicted to encode a kda highly charged protein with a glutamine rich tract. a bifunctional snf lacz fusion protein was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to be localized to the nucleus, suggesting that the snf protein is located in the nucleus.
