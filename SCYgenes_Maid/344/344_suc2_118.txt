a suppressor of snf mutations causes constitutive high level invertase synthesis in yeast.. . the snf gene product of saccharomyces cerevisiae is required to derepress expression of many glucose repressible genes, including the suc structural gene for invertase. strains carrying a recessive snf mutation are unable to ferment sucrose. we have isolated partial phenotypic revertants of a snf mutant that were able to ferment sucrose. genetic characterization of these revertants showed that the suppressor mutations were all recessive and defined eight complementation groups, designated ssn through ssn (suppressor of snf ). the revertants were assayed for secreted invertase activity, and although activity was detected in members of each complementation group, only the ssn strains contained wild type levels. synthesis of secreted invertase in ssn strains was found to be constitutive, that is, insensitive to glucose repression; moreover, the ssn mutations also conferred constitutivity in a wild type ( snf ) genetic background and are, therefore, not merely suppressors of snf . pleiotropic defects were observed in ssn mutants. genetic analysis suggested that the ssn mutations are allelic to the cyc mutation isolated by r. j. rothstein and f. sherman, which causes increased production of iso cytochrome c. the data suggest a regulatory function for ssn .
