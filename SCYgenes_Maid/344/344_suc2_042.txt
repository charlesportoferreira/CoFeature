saccharomyces cerevisiae bur encodes a drap/ncalpha homolog that has both positive and negative roles in transcription in vivo.. . bur and bur were identified previously by selecting for mutations that increase transcription from an upstream activating sequence (uas) less promoter in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the bur and bur mutations are recessive, increase transcription from a suc delta uas allele, and cause other mutant phenotypes, suggesting that burp and burp function as general repressors of the basal transcriptional machinery. the molecular cloning and characterization of bur and bur are presented here. bur is identical to mot, a previously characterized essential gene that encodes an atp dependent inhibitor of the tata box binding protein. cloning and nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that bur encodes a homolog of drap (also called ncalpha), a mammalian repressor of basal transcription. strains that contain a bur null allele are viable but grow extremely poorly, demonstrating that bur is critical for normal cell growth in yeast. the burp histone fold domain is required for function; an extensive nonoverlapping set of deletion alleles throughout the histone fold domain impairs bur function in vivo, whereas mutations in the amino and carboxy terminal tails have no detectable effect. bur and bur/mot have different functions depending on promoter context. although the bur and bur mutations increase transcription from delta uas promoters, they result in reduced transcription from the wild type gal and gal promoters. this transcriptional defect is due to the inability of the gal uas to function in bur strains. the similar phenotypes of bur and bur (mot) mutations suggest that burp and motp have related, but not identical, functions in modulating the activity of the general transcription machinery in vivo.
