the glucose regulated nuclear localization of hexokinase in saccharomyces cerevisiae is mig dependent.. . two major mediators of glucose repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae are the proteins mig and hxk. the mechanism of hxk dependent glucose repression pathway is not well understood, but the mig dependent part of the pathway has been elucidated in great detail. here we report that hxk has a glucose regulated nuclear localization and that mig, a transcriptional repressor responsible for glucose repression of many genes, is required to sequester hxk into the nucleus. mig and hxk interacted in vivo in a yeast two hybrid assay and in vitro in immunoprecipitation and glutathione s transferase pull down experiments. we found that the lys() met() decapeptide of hxk, which is necessary for nuclear localization of the protein, is also essential for interaction with the mig protein. our results also show that the hxk mig interaction is of physiological significance because both proteins have been found interacting together in a cluster with dna fragments containing the mig site of suc promoter. we conclude that hxk operates by interacting with mig to generate a repressor complex located in the nucleus of s. cerevisiae during growth in glucose medium.
