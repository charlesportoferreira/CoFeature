purification and characterization of acid trehalase from the yeast suc mutant.. . acid trehalase was purified from the yeast suc deletion mutant. after hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the enzyme could be purified to a single band or peak by a further step of either polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, or isoelectric focusing. an apparent molecular mass of , da was calculated from gel filtration. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate suggested a molecular mass of , da. endoglycosidase h digestion of the purified enzyme resulted after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis in one distinct band at , da, representing the mannose free protein moiety of acid trehalase. the carbohydrate content of the enzyme was %. amino acid analysis indicated residues/molecule of enzyme including cysteine moieties and only methionine. the isoelectric point of the enzyme was estimated by gel electrofocusing to be approximately .. the catalytic activity showed a maximum at ph .. the activity of the enzyme was not inhibited by mm each of hgcl, edta, iodoacetic acid, phenanthrolinium chloride or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. there was no activation by divalent metal ions. the acid trehalase exhibited an apparent km for trehalose of . +/ . mm and a vmax of mumol of trehalose min x mg at degrees c and ph .. the acid trehalase is located in the vacuoles. the rabbit antiserum raised against acid trehalase exhibited strong cross reaction with purified invertase. these cross reactions were removed by affinity chromatography using invertase coupled to cnbr activated sepharose b. precipitation of acid trehalase activity was observed with the purified antiserum.
