the naturally occurring silent invertase structural gene suc zero contains an amber stop codon that is occasionally read through.. . the yeast invertase structural gene suc has two naturally occurring alleles, the active one and a silent allele called suc zero. strains carrying suc zero are unable to ferment sucrose and do not show detectable invertase activity. we have isolated suc zero and found an amber codon at position of amino acids. however, transformants carrying suc zero on a multicopy plasmid were able to ferment sucrose and showed detectable invertase activity. full length invertase was found in gels stained for active invertase and in immunoblots. therefore we concluded that the amber codon is occasionally read as an amino acid. the calculated frequency of read through is about % of all translation events.
