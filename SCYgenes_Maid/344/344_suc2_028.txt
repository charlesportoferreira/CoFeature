cyclic amp can decrease expression of genes subject to catabolite repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . external cyclic amp (camp) hindered the derepression of gluconeogenic enzymes in a pde mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it did not prevent invertase derepression. camp reduced nearly fold the transcription driven by upstream activation sequence (uasfbp) from fbp, encoding fructose , bisphosphatase; it decreased fold the activation of transcription by uasfbp. nuclear extracts from cells derepressed in the presence of camp were impaired in the formation of specific uasfbp protein complexes in band shift experiments. camp does not appear to act through the repressing protein mig. control of fbp transcription through camp is redundant with other regulatory mechanisms.
