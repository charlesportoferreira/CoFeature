adenovirus ea specifically blocks swi/snf dependent transcriptional activation.. . expression of the adenovirus ea oncoprotein in saccharomyces cerevisiae produces a slow growth phenotype with accumulation of cells in the g phase of the cell cycle. this effect is due to the n terminal and cr domains of ea, which in rodent cells are involved in triggering cellular transformation and also in binding to the cellular transcriptional coactivator p. a genetic screen was undertaken to identify genes required for the function of ea in s. cerevisiae. this screen identified snf, a gene encoding the kda subunit of the swi/snf transcriptional regulatory complex. mutation of genes encoding known members of the swi/snf complex also led to loss of ea function, suggesting that the swi/snf complex is a target of ea. moreover, expression of ea in wild type cells specifically blocked transcriptional activation of the ino and suc genes, whose activation pathways are distinct but have a common requirement for the swi/snf complex. these data demonstrate a specific functional interaction between ea and the swi/snf complex and suggest that a similar interaction takes place in rodent and human cells.
