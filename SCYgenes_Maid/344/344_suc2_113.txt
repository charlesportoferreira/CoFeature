genes affecting the regulation of suc gene expression by glucose repression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae with defects in sucrose or raffinose fermentation were isolated. in addition to mutations in the suc structural gene for invertase, we recovered recessive mutations that affected the regulation of invertase synthesis by glucose repression. these mutations included five new snf (sucrose nonfermenting) alleles and also defined five new complementation groups, designated snf, snf, snf, snf, and snf. the snf, snf, and snf mutants produced little or no secreted invertase under derepressing conditions and were pleiotropically defective in galactose and glycerol utilization, which are both regulated by glucose repression. the snf mutant produced low levels of secreted invertase under derepressing conditions, and no pleiotropy was detected. the snf mutants derepressed secreted invertase to % the wild type level but grew less well on sucrose than expected from their invertase activity; in addition, snf mutants synthesized some invertase under glucose repressing conditions. we examined the interactions between the different snf mutations and ssn, a mutation causing constitutive (glucose insensitive) high level invertase synthesis that was previously isolated as a suppressor of snf. the ssn mutation completely suppressed the defects in derepression of invertase conferred by snf, snf, snf and snf, and each double mutant showed the constitutivity for invertase typical of ssn single mutants. in contrast, snf ssn and snf ssn strains produced only moderate levels of invertase under derepressing conditions and very low levels under repressing conditions. these findings suggest roles for the snf through snf and ssn genes in the regulation of suc gene expression by glucose repression.
