molecular and genetic analysis of the snf gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mutations in the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae prevent full derepression of the suc (invertase) gene in response to glucose limitation. we report the molecular cloning of the snf gene by complementation. sequence analysis predicts that the gene product is a kda acidic protein. disruption of the chromosomal locus causes a fewfold decrease in invertase derepression, a growth defect on raffinose, temperature sensitive growth on glucose, and a sporulation defect in homozygous diploids. genetic analysis of the interactions of the snf null mutation with ssn and spt/ssn suppressor mutations distinguished snf from the snf, snf and snf genes. the snf mutation also behaved differently from mutations in snf and snf in that snf ssn double mutants displayed a synthetic phenotype of severe temperature sensitivity for growth. we also mapped snf to the right arm of chromosome xii near the centromere.
