mutations causing constitutive invertase synthesis in yeast. genetic interactions with snf mutations.. . we have selected mutants able to grow on sucrose in the presence of deoxyglucose. we identified recessive mutations in three major complementation groups that cause constitutive (glucose insensitive) secreted invertase synthesis. two groups comprise alleles of the previously identified hxk and reg genes, and the third group was designated cid (constitutive invertase derepression). the effect of cid on suc expression is mediated by the suc upstream regulatory region, as judged by the constitutive expression of a suc leu lacz fusion in which the leu promoter is under control of suc upstream sequences. a cid mutation also causes glucose insensitive expression of maltase. the previously isolated constitutive mutation ssn is epistatic to cid, reg and hxk for very high level constitutive invertase expression. mutations in snf genes that prevent derepression of invertase are epistatic to cid, reg and hxk; we have previously shown that ssn has different epistasis relationships with snf mutations. the constitutive mutation tup was found to resemble ssn in its genetic interactions with snf mutations. these findings suggest that cid, reg and hxk are functionally distinct from ssn and tup.
