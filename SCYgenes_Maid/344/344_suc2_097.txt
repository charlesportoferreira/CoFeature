molecular analysis of snf and snf, genes required for expression of glucose repressible genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the snf and snf genes are required for derepression of suc and other glucose repressible genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to glucose deprivation. previous genetic evidence suggested that snf and snf have functionally related roles. we cloned both genes by complementation and showed that the cloned dna was tightly linked to the corresponding chromosomal locus. both genes in multiple copy complemented only the cognate snf mutation. the snf gene encodes a . kilobase rna, and the snf gene encodes a kilobase rna. both rnas contained poly(a) and were present in low abundance. neither was regulated by glucose repression, and the level of snf rna was not dependent on snf function or vice versa. disruption of either gene at its chromosomal locus still allowed low level derepression of secreted invertase activity, suggesting that these genes are required for high level expression but are not directly involved in regulation. further evidence was the finding that snf and snf mutants failed to derepress acid phosphatase, which is not regulated by glucose repression. the snf and snf functions were required for derepression of suc mrna.
