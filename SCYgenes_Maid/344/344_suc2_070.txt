chromatin structure of the yeast suc promoter in regulatory mutants.. . we have previously suggested that two positioned nucleosomes are removed from the promoter of the saccharomyces cerevisiae suc gene upon depression by glucose starvation. to gain further insight into the changes accompanying derepression at the chromatin level we have studied the chromatin structure of the suc promoter in several mutants affecting suc expression. the non derepressible mutants snf, snf and snf present a chromatin structure characteristic of the repressed state, irrespective of the presence or absence of glucose. the non repressible mutants, mig and ssn, as well as the double mutant snfs sn exhibit an opened chromatin structure even in the presence of glucose. these results suggest that the dna binding protein encoded by mig is necessary to produce the characteristic pattern of repressed chromatin and that the snf protein kinase is sufficient to produce the derepressed chromatin pattern. a model is presented for the transitions that result in opening up of the chromatin structure.
