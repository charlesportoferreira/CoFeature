analysis by atomic force microscopy of med binding to cis acting regulatory elements of the suc and hxk genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . med protein is a regulator that specifically binds to upstream activating sequences (uass) of suc promoter, to downstream repressing sequences (drss) of the hxk gene and to the carboxy terminal domain of the rna polymerase ii. atomic force microscopy has allowed for direct visualization of med interactions with a bp fragment of suc promoter and with a bp fragment of hxk gene, containing respectively the uass and drss regulatory regions. this approach has provided complementary information about the position and the structure of the dna protein complexes. med binding to dna results in total covering of one of the two existing bp motives (consensus, (a/c)(a/g)gaaat) in the studied dna fragments. no preference for binding either of the two uass of suc promoter as well as for the two drss of hxk gene has been found. we also discuss whether this protein works as dimer or as a monomer.
