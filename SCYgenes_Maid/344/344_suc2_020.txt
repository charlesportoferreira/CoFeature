evidence for the involvement of the glc reg phosphatase and the snf snf kinase in the regulation of ino transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . binding of the tata binding protein (tbp) to the promoter is a pivotal step in rna polymerase ii transcription. to identify factors that regulate tbp, we selected for suppressors of a tbp mutant that exhibits promoter specific defects in activated transcription in vivo and severely reduced affinity for tata boxes in vitro. dominant mutations in snf and recessive mutations in reg, opi, and rtf were isolated that specifically suppress the inositol auxotrophy of the tbp mutant strains. opi encodes a repressor of ino transcription. reg and snf encode regulators of the glc phosphatase and snf kinase, respectively, and have well studied roles in glucose repression. in two hybrid assays, one snf mutation enhances the interaction between snf and snf. suppression of the tbp mutant by our reg and snf mutations appears unrelated to glucose repression, since these mutations do not alleviate repression of suc, and glucose levels have little effect on ino transcription. moreover, mutations in tup, ssn, and glc, but not hxk and mig, can cause suppression. our data suggest that association of tbp with the tata box may be regulated, directly or indirectly, by a substrate of snf. analysis of ino transcription in various mutant strains suggests that this substrate is distinct from opi.
