med, a subunit of the mediator ctd complex of rna polymerase ii, directly binds to regulatory elements of suc and hxk genes.. . in a search to identify new factors required for expression of suc gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have partially purified a kda protein (p) that bound both the drss of the hxk gene and the uass of suc gene. the amino terminal sequence of p identified the med gene (open reading frame ybrc), located in chromosome ii of s. cerevisiae, as the gene coding for the protein. disruption of this gene has demonstrated that is an essential gene for yeast growth. to determine whether the p protein represents the med product, we expressed med gene in e. coli and demonstrated that the heterologous synthesized protein specifically binds to both uassuc and drshxk. this observation suggests that med may be important for the coupling of the glucose repression pathway of suc gene to the hxk gene expression. med has been described as a mediator protein interacting with the ctd of the rna polymerase ii. thus, the role of med could be to act as coupling factor by linking activating and repressing transcription complexes to the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme transcriptional machinery. copyright academic press.
