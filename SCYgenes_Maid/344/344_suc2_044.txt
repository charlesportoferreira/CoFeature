interplay of yeast global transcriptional regulators ssnp tupp and swi snf and their effect on chromatin structure.. . transcriptional regulation in yeast involves a number of general trans acting factors affecting chromatin structure. the swi snf complex is required for expression of a large number of genes and has the ability to remodel chromatin in vitro. the ssnp tupp repressor complex may be involved in chromatin organization through the interaction with pathway specific dna binding proteins. to study the interplay of these factors and their effect on chromatin we have analyzed suc chromatin structure in wild type cells and in strains bearing combinations of ssn/tup and swi mutations. we have mapped nucleosome positioning of the repressed gene in wild type cells using primer extension methodology, allowing base pair resolution, and have analyzed details of chromatin remodeling in the derepressed state. in ssn or tup mutants under repressing conditions the observed changes in suc chromatin structure may be suppressed by the swi mutation, suggesting that ssnp tupp is not required for the establishment of nucleosome positioning at the suc promoter. our data indicate the involvement of chromatin remodeling factors distinct from the swi snf complex in suc transcriptional regulation and suggest that swi snf may antagonize ssnp tupp by controlling remodeling activity. we also show that a relatively high level of suc transcription can coexist with positioned nucleosomes.
