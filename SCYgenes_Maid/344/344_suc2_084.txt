structural requirements for protein n glycosylation. influence of acceptor peptides on cotranslational glycosylation of yeast invertase and site directed mutagenesis around a sequon sequence.. . to understand better the structural requirements of the protein moiety important for n glycosylation, we have examined the influence of proline residues with respect to their position around the consensus sequence (or sequon) asn xaa ser/thr. in the first part of the paper, experiments are described using a cell free translation/glycosylation system from reticulocytes supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes to test the ability of potential acceptor peptides to interfere with glycosylation of nascent yeast invertase chains. it was found that peptides, being acceptors for oligosaccharide transferase in vitro, inhibit cotranslational glycosylation, whereas nonacceptors have no effect. acceptor peptides do not abolish translocation of nascent chains into the endoplasmic reticulum. results obtained with proline containing peptides are compatible with the notion that a proline residue in an n terminal position of a potential glycosylation site does not interfere with glycosylation, whereas in the position xaa or at the c terminal of the sequon, proline prevents and does not favour oligosaccharide transfer, respectively. this statement was further substantiated by in vivo studies using site directed mutagenesis to introduce a proline residue at the c terminal of a selected glycosylation site of invertase. expression of this mutation in three different systems, in yeast cells, frog oocytes and by cell free translation/glycosylation in reticulocytes supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes, leads to an inhibition of glycosylation with both qualitative and quantitative differences. this may indicate that host specific factors also contribute to glycosylation.
