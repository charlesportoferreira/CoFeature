structure and expression of the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the snf gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for normal regulation of gene expression by glucose repression. a functional snf gene product is required to derepress many glucose repressible genes in response to conditions of low external glucose. in the case of the suc structural gene for invertase, snf acts at the rna level. we have reported the isolation of a cloned gene that complements the snf defect in s. cerevisiae and that is homologous to dna at the snf locus (j. l. celenza and m. carlson, mol. cell. biol. . , ). in this work we identified a . kilobase polyadenylate containing rna encoded by the snf gene and showed that its level is neither regulated by glucose repression nor dependent on a functional snf product. the position of the snf rna relative to the cloned dna was mapped, and the direction of transcription was determined. the cloned dna was used to disrupt the snf gene at its chromosomal locus. gene disruption resulted in a snf phenotype, thereby proving that the cloned gene is the snf gene and showing that the phenotype of a true null mutation is indistinguishable from that of previously isolated snf mutations.
