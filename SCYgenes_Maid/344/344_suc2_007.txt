the role of the ' untranslated region (utr) in glucose dependent mrna decay.. . when s. cerevisiae are grown with glucose, sdh mrna encoding the iron protein of the succinate dehydrogenase complex is unstable and present at low level. in yeast grown without glucose, sdh mrna is stable and its level rises. addition of glucose to a glucose limited culture causes the sdh mrna level to fall rapidly with a half life of approximately min. previously the 'utr of the mrna of sdh was shown to be necessary and sufficient to destabilize it in glucose (lombardo et al., ). we now show that the sdh and suc 'utrs are capable of conferring glucose sensitive mrna instability. we also examine how changes in the sdh 'utr affect glucose triggered degradation. finally, we show that changes in mrna stability are correlated with changes in translational efficiency for these transcripts. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
