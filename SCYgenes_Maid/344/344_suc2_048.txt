polymeric suc genes in natural populations of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the comparative chromosomal locations of polymeric beta fructosidase suc genes have been determined by southern blot hybridization with the suc probe in different strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae. most of the strains exhibited a single suc gene, but in some strains two or three suc genes were found. all suc strains carried a silent suc(zero) sequence. the accumulation of suc genes was observed in populations derived from sources containing sucrose and seems to be absent in strains from sources promoting the mel gene.
