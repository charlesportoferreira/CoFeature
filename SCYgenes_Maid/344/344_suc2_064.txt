a zinc finger protein from candida albicans is involved in sucrose utilization.. . a sucrose inducible alpha glucosidase activity that hydrolyzes sucrose in candida albicans has been demonstrated previously. the enzyme is assayable in whole cells and was inhibited by both sucrose and maltose. a c. albicans gene (casuc) that affects sucrose utilization and alpha glucosidase activity was cloned by expression in a saccharomyces cerevisiae suc mutant () devoid of invertase genes. casuc enabled the s. cerevisiae mutant to utilize both sucrose and maltose. dna sequence analysis revealed that casuc encodes a putative zinc finger containing protein with % identity to a maltose regulatory gene (mal) of s. cerevisiae. the gene products of casuc and mal are approximately the same size ( and amino acids, respectively), and each contains a single zinc finger located at the n terminus. the zinc fingers of casuc and mal comprise six conserved cysteines (c zinc finger) and are of the general form cys xaa cys xaa cys xaavariable cys xaa cys + ++xaa cys (where xaan indicates a stretch of the indicated number of any amino acids). both contain five amino acids in the variable region. casuc also complemented the maltose utilization defect of an s. cerevisiae mutant (tcy ) containing a defined mutation in a maltose regulatory gene. the sucrose utilization defect of type ii candida stellatoidea, a sucrase negative mutant of c. albicans, was corrected by casuc. determinations of alpha glucosidase activity in whole cells revealed that activity was restored in transformants cultivated on either sucrose or maltose. to our knowledge, this is the first zinc finger encoding gene, as well as the first putative regulatory gene, to be identified in c. albicans.
