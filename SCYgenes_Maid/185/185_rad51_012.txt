role for the fission yeast recq helicase in dna repair in g.. . members of the recq helicase subfamily are mutated in several human genomic instability syndromes, such as bloom, werner, and rothmund thomson syndromes. we show that rqh, the single schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue, is a ' to ' helicase and exists with top in a high molecular weight complex. top deletion is inviable, and this is suppressed by concomitant loss of rqh helicase activity or loss of recombination functions. this is consistent with recq helicases in other systems. by using epistasis analysis of the uv radiation sensitivity and by analyzing the kinetics of rhp (rad homologue), rqh, and top focus formation in response to uv in synchronized cells, we identify the first evidence of a function for rqh and top in the repair of uv induced dna damage in g(). our data provide evidence that rqh functions after rad focus formation during dna repair. we also identify a function for rqh upstream of recombination in an rhp dependent (rad homologue) pathway. the model that these data allow us to propose helps to reconcile different interpretations of recq family helicase function that have arisen between work based on the s. pombe system and models based on studies of saccharomyces cerevisiae sgs suggesting that recq helicases act before rad.
