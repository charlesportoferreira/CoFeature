transcription and double strand breaks induce similar mitotic recombination events in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have made a comparative analysis of double strand break (dsb) induced recombination and spontaneous recombination under low and high transcription conditions in yeast. we constructed two different recombination substrates, one for the analysis of intermolecular gene conversions and the other for intramolecular gene conversions and inversions. such substrates were based on the same leu hor allele fused to the tet promoter and containing a bp ho site. gene conversions and inversions were differently affected by rad, rad, rad, and rad single and double mutations, consistent with the actual view that such events occur by different recombination mechanisms. however, the effect of each mutation on each type of recombination event was the same, whether associated with transcription or induced by the ho mediated dsb. both the highly transcribed dna and the ho cut sequence acted as recipients of the gene conversion events. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcription promotes initiation of recombination along the dna sequence being transcribed. the similarity between transcription associated and dsb induced recombination suggests that transcription promotes dna breaks.
