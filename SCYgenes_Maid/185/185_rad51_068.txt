saccharomyces cerevisiae rad mutants are defective in dna damage associated sister chromatid exchanges but exhibit increased rates of homology directed translocations.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae rad is structurally similar to escherichia coli reca. we investigated the role of s. cerevisiae rad in dna damage associated unequal sister chromatid exchanges (sces), translocations, and inversions. the frequency of these rearrangements was measured by monitoring mitotic recombination between two his fragments, his delta' and his delta'.hocs, when positioned on different chromosomes or in tandem and oriented in direct or inverted orientation. recombination was measured after cells were exposed to chemical agents and radiation and after ho endonuclease digestion at his delta'.hocs. wild type and rad mutant strains showed no difference in the rate of spontaneous sces; however, the rate of spontaneous inversions was decreased threefold in the rad mutant. the rad null mutant was defective in dna damage associated sce when cells were exposed to either radiation or chemical dna damaging agents or when ho endonuclease induced double strand breaks (dsbs) were directly targeted at his delta'.hocs. the defect in dna damage associated sces in rad mutants correlated with an eightfold higher spontaneous level of directed translocations in diploid strains and with a higher level of radiation associated translocations. we suggest that s. cerevisiae rad facilitates genomic stability by reducing nonreciprocal translocations generated by rad independent break induced replication (bir) mechanisms.
