hyper resistance of meiotic cells to radiation due to a strong expression of a single reca like gene in caenorhabditis elegans.. . sensitivity of meiotic cells to dna damaging agents is little understood. we have demonstrated that the meiotic pachytene nuclei in the caenorhabditis elegans gonad are hyper resistant to x ray irradiation, but not to uv irradiation, whereas the early embryonic cells after fertilization and the full grown oocytes are not. the ce rdh gene [rad, dmc (lim), homolog or ce rad ], which is essential for the meiotic recombination, is the only bacterial reca like gene in the nematode genome, and is strongly expressed in the meiotic cells. following silencing of the ce rdh gene by rna interference, the meiotic cells become more sensitive to x ray irradiation than the early embryonic cells. this is the first report that meiotic cells are hyper resistant to dna strand breaks due to the high level of expression of the enzyme(s) involved in meiotic homologous recombination.
