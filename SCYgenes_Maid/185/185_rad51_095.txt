a neurospora double strand break repair gene, mus , encodes a rad homologue and is inducible by mutagens.. . we isolated a neurospora crassa cdna that encodes a rad homologue (ncrad) by pcr, using degenerate primers. rflp mapping demonstrated that the cloned gene is located close to the ro locus on the right arm of linkage group v (lgvr). in a second experiment, we used sib selection to identify a cosmid clone containing the mus gene in a n. crassa genomic library. fine scale mapping of the mus mutant showed the gene order on lgvr near ro to be. ad (. mu) pab (. mu) mus (. mu) inv. the nucleotide sequence of the mus gene matched that of the ncrad cdna. thus, the mus gene encodes the rad homologue. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mus protein shows .% and .% overall identity to the schizosaccharomyces pombe rad protein and the human hrad protein, respectively, and a higher level of identity ( %) within the conserved n terminal region ( residues). the mus protein shows homology to rad from budding yeast only within the n terminal region (.% identity over amino acids) which is conserved among rad homologues. yeast two hybrid analysis reveals that the mus protein binds to both the mei protein, a rad homologue, and to itself in vivo. an ncrad mutant obtained by the ripping procedure showed the same sensitivity as the original mus mutant to the following mutagens and chemicals. uv light, nqo ( nitroquinoline oxide), mms (methyl methanesulfonate), ems (ethyl methanesulfonate), mnng (n methyl n' nitro n nitrosoguanidine), tbhp (tert butyl hydroperoxide), hu (hydroxyurea) and histidine. unlike the rad transcript in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mus transcript could not be detected in mycelium under normal growth conditions, but expression of the gene was induced by uv irradiation or treatment with mms.
