an aspergillus nidulans uvsc null mutant is deficient in homologous dna integration.. . the aspergillus nidulans uvsc gene was identified as a homolog of rad and reca of saccharomyces cerevisiae and escherichia coli, respectively, whose role in genetic recombination and recombinational repair has been extensively studied. like many other filamentous fungi, a. nidulans shows no bias towards either homologous or ectopic integration of exogenous dna. therefore it is a unique and useful organism for the study of the mechanisms of dna integration. homologous integration of a . kb argb gene was not detected in transformants obtained from a uvsc null mutant. in contrast, the frequency of homologous integration in uvsc+ control strains varied from to %. another feature observed with the uvsc null mutant was that an increased number of transformants had undergone ectopic integrations at multiple sites in the genome. these results are consistent with the established function of rad/reca, and further indicate the involvement of redundant pathways in integration of exogenous dna. this study provides direct evidence for the involvement of uvsc in exogenous dna integration and should contribute to the improvement of genetic manipulations in general, but particularly in fungi.
