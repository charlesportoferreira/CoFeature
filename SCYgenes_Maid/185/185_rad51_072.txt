chromosome instability and defective recombinational repair in knockout mutants of the five rad paralogs.. . the rad protein, a eukaryotic homologue of escherichia coli reca, plays a central role in both mitotic and meiotic homologous dna recombination (hr) in saccharomyces cerevisiae and is essential for the proliferation of vertebrate cells. five vertebrate genes, radb, c, and d and xrcc and , are implicated in hr on the basis of their sequence similarity to rad (rad paralogs). we generated mutants deficient in each of these proteins in the chicken b lymphocyte dt cell line and report here the comparison of four new mutants and their complemented derivatives with our previously reported radb mutant. the rad paralog mutations all impair hr, as measured by targeted integration and sister chromatid exchange. remarkably, the mutant cell lines all exhibit very similar phenotypes. spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, high sensitivity to killing by cross linking agents (mitomycin c and cisplatin), mild sensitivity to gamma rays, and significantly attenuated rad focus formation during recombinational repair after exposure to gamma rays. moreover, all mutants show partial correction of resistance to dna damage by overexpression of human rad. we conclude that the rad paralogs participate in repair as a functional unit that facilitates the action of rad in hr.
