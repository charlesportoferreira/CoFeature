the saccharomyces cerevisiae wrn homolog sgsp participates in telomere maintenance in cells lacking telomerase.. . werner syndrome (ws) is marked by early onset of features resembling aging, and is caused by loss of the recq family dna helicase wrn. precisely how loss of wrn leads to the phenotypes of ws is unknown. cultured ws fibroblasts shorten their telomeres at an increased rate per population doubling and the premature senescence this loss induces can be bypassed by telomerase. here we show that wrn co localizes with telomeric factors in telomerase independent immortalized human cells, and further that the budding yeast recq family helicase sgsp influences telomere metabolism in yeast cells lacking telomerase. telomerase deficient sgs mutants show increased rates of growth arrest in the g/m phase of the cell cycle as telomeres shorten. in addition, telomerase deficient sgs mutants have a defect in their ability to generate survivors of senescence that amplify telomeric tg repeats, and sgs functions in parallel with the recombination gene rad to generate survivors. our findings indicate that sgsp and wrn function in telomere maintenance, and suggest that telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of ws and perhaps other recq helicase diseases.
