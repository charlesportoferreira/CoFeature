the preference for gt rich dna by the yeast rad protein defines a set of universal pairing sequences.. . the rad protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a eukaryotic homolog of the reca protein, the prototypic dna strand exchange protein of escherichia coli. rad gene function is required for efficient genetic recombination and for dna double strand break repair. recently, we demonstrated that reca protein has a preferential affinity for gt rich dna sequences several of which exhibit enhanced reca protein promoted homologous pairing activity. the fundamental similarity between the reca and rad proteins suggests that rad might display an analogous bias. using in vitro selection, here we show that the yeast rad protein shares the same preference for gt rich sequences as its prokaryotic counterpart. this bias is also manifest as an increased ability of rad protein to promote the invasion of supercoiled dna by homologous gt rich single stranded dna, an activity not previously described for the eukaryotic pairing protein. we propose that the preferred utilization of gt rich sequences is a conserved feature among all homologs of reca protein, and that gt rich regions are loci for increased genetic exchange in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
