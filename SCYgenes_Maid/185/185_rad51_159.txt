meiotic cells monitor the status of the interhomolog recombination complex.. . during meiosis, mutations that cause defects at intermediate stages in the recombination process confer arrest at the end of prophase (e.g., pachytene). in yeast, mutations of this type include rads, dmc, rad, and zip. rad is likely part of a recombination initiation complex. dmc, rad, and zip encode two reca homologs and a synaptonemal complex protein, respectively. we report here the effects of mutations in two other (meiosis specific) genes, red and mek/mre, that encode a chromosome structure component and a protein kinase, respectively. a red or mek/mre mutation alleviates completely rads, dmc, rad, and zip arrest. furthermore, the red and mek/mre mutations define a unique, previously unrecognized aspect of recombination imposed very early in the process, during dsb formation. finally, the red and mek/mre mutations appear to alleviate prophase arrest directly rather than by eliminating, or permitting bypass of, the rads, dmc, rad, or zip defects. these and other observations suggest that a meiosis specific regulatory surveillance process monitors the status of the protein/dna interhomolog recombination machinery as an integral entity, in its proper chromosomal context, and dependent upon its appropriate red and mek/mre promoted development. we speculate that a properly developed recombination complex emits an inhibitory signal to delay progression of meiotic cells out of prophase until or unless the recombination process has progressed, at least past certain critical steps, and perhaps to completion.
