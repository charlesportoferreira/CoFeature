structural analysis of a reca like gene in the genome of arabidopsis thaliana.. . a reca like gene was identified in the genome of arabidopsis thaliana by means of pcr using primers designed on the basis of previously reported amino acid sequences of eukaryotic reca like proteins. the structure of the gene, termed arlim, was investigated by comparing the primary structure of the genomic dna with that of the corresponding cdna. the open reading frame, which was split into exons, was established to have the capacity for encoding a . kda polypeptide. the amino acid sequence of the putative product of arlim showed a high degree of similarity to that of lim in the monocotyledonous plant lilium, including a % identity, and to those of other reca like genes in yeasts and vertebrates with identities of %. phylogenetic analysis indicated arlim to be much closer to meiosis specific lim and dmc in saccharomyces cerevisiae than to rad in s. cerevisiae and its homologues on an evolutionary scale.
