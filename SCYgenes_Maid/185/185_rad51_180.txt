identification of the dna damage responsive elements of the rhp+ gene, a reca and rad homolog from the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe.. . the schizosaccharomyces pombe rhp+ gene encodes a recombinational repair protein that shares significant sequence identities with the bacterial reca and the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein. levels of rhp+ mrna increase following several types of dna damage or inhibition of dna synthesis. an rhp.ura fusion gene was used to identify the cis acting promoter elements involved in regulating rhp+ expression in response to dna damage. two elements, designated dre and dre (for damage responsive element), match a decamer consensus urs (upstream repressing sequence) found in the promoters of many other dna repair and metabolism genes from s. cerevisiae. however, our results show that dre and dre each function as a uas (upstream activating sequence) rather than a urs and are also required for dna damage inducibility of the gene. a bp fragment located downstream of both dre and dre is responsible for urs function. the dre and dre elements cross competed for binding to two proteins of and kda. dnase i footprint analysis suggests that dre and dre bind to the same dna binding proteins. these results suggest that the dre binding proteins may play an important role in the dna damage inducibility of rhp+ expression.
