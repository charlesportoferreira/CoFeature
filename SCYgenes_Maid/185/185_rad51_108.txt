rad and dmc form mixed complexes associated with mouse meiotic chromosome cores and synaptonemal complexes.. . the eukaryotic reca homologues rad and dmc function in homology recognition and formation of joint molecule recombination intermediates during yeast meiosis. the precise immunolocalization of these two proteins on the meiotic chromosomes of plants and animals has been complicated by their high degree of identity at the amino acid level. with antibodies that have been immunodepleted of cross reactive epitopes, we demonstrate that rad and dmc have identical distribution patterns in extracts of mouse spermatocytes in successive prophase i stages, suggesting coordinate functionality. immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy with these antibodies demonstrate colocalization of the two proteins on the meiotic chromosome cores at early prophase i. we also show that mouse rad and dmc establish protein protein interactions with each other and with the chromosome core component cor(scp) in a two hybrid system and in vitro binding analyses. these results suggest that the formation of a multiprotein recombination complex associated with the meiotic chromosome cores is essential for the development and fulfillment of the meiotic recombination process.
