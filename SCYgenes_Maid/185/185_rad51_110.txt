characterization of the human rad genomic locus and examination of tumors with q loss of heterozygosity (loh).. . human rad (hrad) has been found to be associated with brca, brca, and p either directly or indirectly and is one of at least eight human genes that are members of the escherichia coli reca/saccharomyces cerevisiae rad family thought to affect genomic stability through dna recombination/repair processes. while inactivation of dna mismatch repair clearly leads to instability of repeated sequences and to an increased risk for tumorigenesis, such a parallel for the reca family members has not been reported. recently, a high frequency of loss of heterozygosity at chromosome q , near the genomic region containing hrad, has been reported in human tumors (w. wick et al., oncogene, . , ). to determine whether hrad inactivation may be involved in the etiology of these tumors, we have characterized the hrad genetic locus and mapped it to chromosome q within the central region of loss of heterozygosity. however, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of tumors did not reveal any mutations in the hrad coding sequence or intron/exon boundaries. we also examined the dna methylation status of a cpg rich region in the putative hrad promoter region. no indication of hypermethylation was found. these results suggest that hrad is not a tumor suppressor because it is either an essential gene, redundant gene and/or independent of the brca/brca tumor suppressor pathway(s).
