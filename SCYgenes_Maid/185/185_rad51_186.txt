associations of ubei with rad, ubl, p, and rad proteins in a yeast two hybrid system.. . the yeast rad dependent pathway is involved in dna recombination and double strand break repair. yeast ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubc participates in s and m phase cyclin degradation and mitotic control. using the human rad protein as the &quot;bait&quot; in a yeast two hybrid system, we have identified a human homolog of yeast ubc, designated ubei, that interacts with rad, rad, p, and a ubiquitin like protein ubl. these interactions are ubei specific, since another dna repair related ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, rad (ubc), does not interact with these proteins. the interaction of ubei with rad is mediated by rad's self association region. these results suggest that the rad dependent processes, cell cycle control, p mediated pathway(s), and ubiquitination interact through human ubei.
