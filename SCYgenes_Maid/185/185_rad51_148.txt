multiple possible sites of brca interacting with dna repair protein rad.. . to investigate the biological consequences of aberrant brca protein during mammary carcinogenesis, we attempted to identify proteins that normally interact with brca. by using a yeast two hybrid system with a hybrid protein that contained residues , of brca protein fused to the gal dna binding domain, we isolated five independent cdna clones that encoded parts of rad protein, a human homolog of bacterial reca. in vitro experiments using anti rad antibody confirmed interaction of brca with rad. the rad binding region of brca detected in the present study was distinct from the region reported recently. further studies using smaller portions of brca defined at least two additional rad binding domains, residues , and , ,. our results suggest that brca can interact with rad through multiple sites of brca and that control of mitotic and meiotic recombination and/or of genomic integrity through binding to rad may be a crucial mechanism by which brca suppresses abnormal proliferation of mammary cells.
