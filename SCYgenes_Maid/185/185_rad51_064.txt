double strand break repair. are rad/reca dna joints barriers to dna replication?. . the central step of homologous recombination is the dna strand exchange reaction catalyzed by bacterial reca or eukaryotic rad. besides rad mediated synthesis dependent strand annealing (sdsa), dna ends can promote replication in escherichia coli (recombination dependent replication, rdr) and yeast (break induced replication, bir). however, what causes a dna end to be repaired via sdsa or via bir/rdr? i propose that rad/reca dna plectonemic joints act as barriers to dna replication and that bir/rdr is only possible when the dna polymerase that synthesizes dna from the invading ' end does not encounter reca/rad dna joints in its path.
