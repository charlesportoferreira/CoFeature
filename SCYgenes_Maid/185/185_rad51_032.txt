intron gain and loss in the evolution of the conserved eukaryotic recombination machinery.. . intron conservation, intron gain or loss and putative intron sliding events were determined for a set of three genes (spo, mre and dmc) involved in basic aspects of recombination in eukaryotes. these are ancient genes and present in nearly all of the major kingdoms. mre is of bacterial origin and can be found in all kingdoms. dmc is a specialized homolog of the bacterial reca protein, whereas the spo gene is of archaebacterial origin. only unique homologs of spo are found in animals and fungi whereas three distantly related spo copies are present in plant genomes. a comparison of the respective intron positions and phases of all genes was performed, demonstrating that a quarter of the intron positions were perfectly conserved over more than years. regarding the remaining three quarters of the introns we found insertions to be about three times more frequent than deletions. aligning the introns of the three different spo homologs of arabidopsis thaliana we propose a conclusive model of their evolution. we postulate that at least one duplication event occurred shortly after the divergence of plants from animals and fungi and that a respective homolog has been retained in a protist group, the apicomplexa.
