characterization of rad independent break induced replication that acts preferentially with short homologous sequences.. . repair of double strand breaks by gene conversions between homologous sequences located on different saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes or plasmids requires rad. when repair occurs between inverted repeats of the same plasmid, both rad dependent and rad independent repairs are found. completion of rad independent plasmid repair events requires rad, rad, rad, tid (rdh), and srs and appears to involve break induced replication coupled to single strand annealing. surprisingly, rad independent recombination requires much less homology ( bp) for strand invasion than does rad dependent repair (approximately bp); in fact, the presence of radp impairs recombination with short homology. the differences between the rad and rad/rad dependent pathways account for the distinct ways that two different recombination processes maintain yeast telomeres in the absence of telomerase.
