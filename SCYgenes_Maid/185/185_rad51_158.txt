cloning of an e. coli reca and yeast rad homolog, rada, an allele of the uvsc in aspergillus nidulans and its mutator effects.. . an e. coli reca and yeast rad homolog from aspergillus nidulans, rada, has been cloned by screening genomic and cdna libraries with a pcr amplified probe. this probe was generated using primers carrying the conserved sequences of eukaryotic reca homologs. the deduced amino acid sequence revealed two conserved walker a and b type nucleotide binding domains and exhibited %, %, and % identity with mei of neurospora crassa, rhp+ of schizosaccharomyces pombe, and rad of saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. rada null mutants constructed by replacing the whole coding region with a selection marker showed high methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity. heterozygous diploids of rada disruptant with the uvsc mutant failed to complement with respect to mms sensitivity, indicating that rada is an allele of uvsc. in selecting spontaneous forward selenate resistant mutations, mutator effects were observed in rada null mutants similarly to those shown in uvsc mutant strains.
