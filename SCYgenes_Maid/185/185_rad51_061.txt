potential role for the blm helicase in recombinational repair via a conserved interaction with rad.. . bloom's syndrome (bs) is an autosomal recessive disorder that predisposes individuals to a wide range of cancers. the gene mutated in bs, blm, encodes a member of the recq family of dna helicases. the precise role played by these enzymes in the cell remains to be determined. however, genome wide hyper recombination is a feature of many recq helicase deficient cells. in eukaryotes, a central step in homologous recombination is catalyzed by the rad protein. in response to agents that induce dna double strand breaks, rad accumulates in nuclear foci that are thought to correspond to sites of recombinational repair. here, we report that purified blm and human rad interact in vitro and in vivo, and that residues in the n and c terminal domains of blm can independently mediate this interaction. consistent with these observations, blm localizes to a subset of rad nuclear foci in normal human cells. moreover, the number of blm foci and the extent to which blm and rad foci co localize increase in response to ionizing radiation. nevertheless, the formation of rad foci does not require functional blm. indeed, in untreated bs cells, an abnormally high proportion of the cells contain rad nuclear foci. exogenous expression of blm markedly reduces the fraction of cells containing rad foci. the interaction between blm and rad appears to have been evolutionarily conserved since the c terminal domain of sgs, the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of blm, interacts with yeast rad. furthermore, genetic analysis reveals that the sgs and rad genes are epistatic indicating that they operate in a common pathway. potential roles for blm in the rad recombinational repair pathway are discussed.
