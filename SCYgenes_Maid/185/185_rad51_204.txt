the human and mouse homologs of the yeast rad gene. cdna cloning, sequence analysis, assignment to human chromosome p. p, and mrna expression in mouse tissues.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae rad gene is involved in dna double strand break repair and mitotic/meiotic recombination. the n terminal amino acid sequence of yeast s. cerevisiae, schizosaccharomyces pombe, and kluyveromyces lactis and chicken is highly conserved. using the technology of mixed oligonucleotide primed amplification of cdna (mopac), two mouse rad homologous cdna fragments were amplified and sequenced. subsequently, we have cloned the cdna of the human and mouse homologs of yeast rad gene by screening cdna libraries using the identified mouse cdna fragments. sequence analysis of cdna derived amino acid revealed a highly conserved n terminus among human, mouse, chicken, and yeast rad genes. the human rad gene was assigned to chromosome p. p by fluorescence in situ hybridization, r banding, and dna analysis of somatic cell hybrids. unlike chicken rad and mouse rad, no significant difference in mouse rad mrna level was found among mouse heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis. in addition to an approximately . kb rad mrna band that is present in all of the tested tissues, an extra mrna species of approximately . kb was detectable in mouse testis.
