stimulation by rad of yeast rad mediated recombination.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the rad and rad genes are involved in recombination and in repair of damaged dna. the rad gene is a structural and functional homologue of the reca gene and the gene product participates in strand exchange and single stranded dna dependent atp hydrolysis by means of nucleoprotein filament formation. the rad gene is important in rad mediated recombination. binding of this protein to rad suggests that they cooperate in recombination. homologues of both rad and rad are conserved from yeast to humans, suggesting that the mechanisms used for pairing homologous dna molecules during recombination may be universal in eukaryotes. here we show that rad protein stimulates rad reactions and that binding to rad is necessary for this stimulatory effect. we conclude that this binding is crucial in recombination and that it facilitates the formation of rad nucleoprotein filaments.
