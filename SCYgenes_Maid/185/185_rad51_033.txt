formation of large palindromic dna by homologous recombination of short inverted repeat sequences in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . large dna palindromes form sporadically in many eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and are often associated with amplified genes. the presence of a short inverted repeat sequence near a dna double strand break has been implicated in the formation of large palindromes in a variety of organisms. previously we have established that in saccharomyces cerevisiae a linear dna palindrome is efficiently formed from a single copy circular plasmid when a dna double strand break is introduced next to a short inverted repeat sequence. in this study we address whether the linear palindromes form by an intermolecular reaction (that is, a reaction between two identical fragments in a head to head arrangement) or by an unusual intramolecular reaction, as it apparently does in other examples of palindrome formation. our evidence supports a model in which palindromes are primarily formed by an intermolecular reaction involving homologous recombination of short inverted repeat sequences. we have also extended our investigation into the requirement for dna double strand break repair genes in palindrome formation. we have found that a deletion of the rad gene significantly reduces palindrome formation by intermolecular recombination and that deletions of two other genes in the rad epistasis group (rad and mre) have little or no effect on palindrome formation. in addition, palindrome formation is dramatically reduced by a deletion of the nucleotide excision repair gene rad.
