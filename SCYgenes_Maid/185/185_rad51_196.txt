the mouse and human homologs of dmc, the yeast meiosis specific homologous recombination gene, have a common unique form of exon skipped transcript in meiosis.. . genetic recombination in meiosis plays an important role in generating diversity of genetic information. in yeast an escherichia coli reca like gene, dmc, is expressed in meiotic prophase and its product co localizes with rad protein on zygotene chromosomes. we have cloned the mouse and human homologs of the yeast dmc gene. the predicted human and mouse dmc proteins showed .% sequence identity with yeast dmc protein. the domain ii region, highly conserved in the e.coli reca like protein family, was also found in the mammalian dmc proteins, including the two atp binding motifs and dna binding sites with the region. in situ hybridization analysis revealed expression of the mouse dmc gene in testicular germ cells in meiosis; rt pcr showed expression in embryonal ovaries. these findings suggest that dmc plays an important role in meiotic homologous recombination. from both the man and mouse we have isolated an alternative spliced form of dmc cdna (dmc d), which is deleted for a region between the two motifs involved in nucleotide binding. since the alternatively spliced dmc d transcript was detected in both male and female germ cells, the encoded protein dmc d may have a novel role in mammalian genetic recombination in meiosis.
