rad interacts with the evolutionarily conserved brc motifs in the human breast cancer susceptibility gene brca.. . recent work has shown that the murine brca tumor suppressor protein interacts with the murine rad protein. this interaction suggests that brca participates in dna repair. residues of the murine brca protein were shown to be involved in this interaction. here, we report the detailed mapping of additional domains that are involved in interactions between the human homologs of these two proteins. through yeast two hybrid and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the rad protein interacts specifically with the eight evolutionarily conserved brc motifs encoded in exon of brca and with a similar motif found in a caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein. deletion analysis demonstrates that residues of human rad interact with the residue minimal region that is conserved in all brc motifs. these data suggest that the brc repeats function to bind rad.
