further characterization of the yeast pso mutant. interaction with rad and rad mutants after photoinduced psoralen lesions.. . the pso mutant was characterized as deficient in some types of recombination, including gene conversion, crossing over, and intrachromosomal recombination. the mode of interaction between pso and rad and between pso and rad mutants indicated that the pso gene belongs to the rad epistasis group for strand break repair. moreover, the presence of the pso mutation decreased mop photoinduced mutagenesis of the rad and rad mutants. complementation tests using heterozygous diploid strains showed that the pso protein might interact with the rad protein during repair of mop photolesions. the pso mutant, even though defective in inter and intra chromosomal recombination, conserves the ability for plasmid integration of circular and linear plasmid dna. on the other hand, similar to the rad mutant, pso was able to incise but did not restore high molecular weight dna during the repair of cross links induced by mop plus uva. these results, together with those of previous reports, indicate that the pso gene belongs to the rad dna repair group and its product participates in the dna rejoining step of the repair of cross link lesions, which are crucial for induced mutagenesis and recombinogenesis.
