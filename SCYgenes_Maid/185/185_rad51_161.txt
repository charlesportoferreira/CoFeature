a novel nucleic acid binding protein that interacts with human rad recombinase.. . using the yeast two hybrid system, we isolated a cdna encoding a novel human protein, named pir, that strongly interacts with human rad recombinase. analysis in vitro confirmed the interaction between rad and pir. pir mrna is expressed in a number of human organs, most notably in testis, thymus, colon and small intestine. the pir gene locus was mapped to chromosome p. . by fluorescence in situ hybridization. the pir protein was expressed in escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. biochemical analysis shows that the pir protein binds both single and double stranded dna, and is capable of aggregating dna. the protein also binds rna. the pir protein may represent a new member of the multiprotein complexes postulated to carry out homologous recombination and dna repair in mammalian cells.
