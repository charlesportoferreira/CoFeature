complex formation in yeast double strand break repair. participation of rad, rad, rad, and rad proteins.. . the repair of dna double strand breaks in saccharomyces cerevisiae requires genes of the rad epistasis group, of which rad and rad are members. here, we show that the x ray sensitivity of rad and rad mutant strains is suppressible by overexpression of rad or rad. virtually complete suppression is provided by the simultaneous overexpression of rad and rad. this suppression occurs at degrees c, where these mutants are more sensitive to x rays, as well as at degrees c and degrees c. in addition, a recombination defect of rad and rad mutants is similarly suppressed. direct in vivo interactions between the rad and rad proteins, and between rad and rad, have also been identified by using the two hybrid system. these results indicate that these four proteins constitute part of a complex, a &quot;recombinosome,&quot; to effect the recombinational repair of double strand breaks.
