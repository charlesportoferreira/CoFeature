roles for two reca homologs in promoting meiotic chromosome synapsis.. . previous studies have shown that the rad and dmc genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae encode homologs of the escherichia coli reca strand exchange enzyme. results presented here demonstrate that the dmc and rad mutants undergo nearly complete chromosome synapsis, but synaptonemal complex formation is delayed substantially compared with wild type. in the zip mutant, chromosomes are paired homologously, but not synapsed, and the protein backbones (axial elements) of each pair of chromosomes are connected intimately to each other at a few sites referred to herein as axial associations. dmc zip and rad zip double mutants assemble axial elements that are not obviously associated, demonstrating that the dmc and rad proteins are required to establish or stabilize axial associations. we propose that axial associations serve to promote meiotic chromosome synapsis and that the absence of these associations accounts for the delayed and inefficient synapsis observed in dmc and rad strains. during meiosis in haploid yeast, chromosome synapsis takes place between nonhomologous chromosome segments. in a zip haploid, axial associations are not apparent, suggesting that these associations depend on interactions between homologous sequences.
