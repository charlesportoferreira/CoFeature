saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking snm, rev or rad have a normal s phase but arrest permanently in g after cisplatin treatment.. . the role of snm, rev and rad in s phase after cisplatin (cddp) dna treatment has been examined. when isogenic deletion mutants snm delta, rev delta and rad delta were arrested in g and treated with doses of cddp causing significant lethality (&lt;% survival in the mutant strains), they progressed through s phase with normal kinetics. the mutants arrested in g like wild type cells, however they did not exit the arrest and reenter the cell cycle. this finding demonstrates that these genes are not required to allow dna replication in the presence of damage. therefore, snm, rev and rad may act after s to allow repair. at high levels of damage (&lt;% survival in wild type cells) s phase was slowed in a mec dependent fashion. the cross link incision kinetics of snm delta and rev delta mutants were also examined; both showed no deficiencies in incision of cross linked dna.
