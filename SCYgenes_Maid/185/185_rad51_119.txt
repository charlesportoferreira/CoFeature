a novel allele of rad that causes severe dna repair and recombination deficiencies only in the absence of rad or rad.. . with the use of an intrachromosomal inverted repeat as a recombination reporter, we have shown that mitotic recombination is dependent on the rad gene, but reduced only fivefold by mutation of rad. rad, a component of the rad independent pathway, was identified previously by screening for mutations that reduced inverted repeat recombination in a rad strain. here we describe a rad mutation, radrk, that also reduced recombination synergistically in a rad background. the phenotype of the radrk strain, which includes weak gamma ray sensitivity, a fourfold reduction in the rate of inverted repeat recombination, elevated allelic recombination, sporulation proficiency, and a reduction in the efficiency of mating type switching and single strand annealing, was similar to that observed for deletion of the rad gene. however, radrk rad double mutants showed synergistic defects in ionizing radiation resistance, sporulation, and mating type switching. these results suggest that rad and rad have partially overlapping functions and that rad can substitute for this function of rad in a rad radrk strain.
