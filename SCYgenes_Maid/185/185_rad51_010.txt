positive and negative roles of homologous recombination in the maintenance of genome stability in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in previous studies of the loss of heterozygosity (loh), we analyzed a hemizygous ura marker on chromosome iii in s. cerevisiae and showed that homologous recombination is involved in processes that lead to loh in multiple ways, including allelic recombination, chromosome size alterations, and chromosome loss. to investigate the role of homologous recombination more precisely, we examined loh events in rad delta, rad delta, rad delta, rad delta rad delta, and rad delta rad delta mutants. as compared to rad(+) cells, the frequency of loh was significantly increased in all mutants, and most events were chromosome loss. other loh events were differentially affected in each mutant. the frequencies of all types of recombination were decreased in rad mutants and enhanced in rad mutants. the rad mutation increased the frequency of ectopic but not allelic recombination. both the rad and rad mutations increased the frequency of intragenic point mutations approximately fold, suggesting that alternative mutagenic pathways partially substitute for homologous recombination. overall, these results indicate that all of the genes are required for chromosome maintenance and that they most likely function in homologous recombination between sister chromatids. in contrast, other recombination pathways can occur at a substantial level even in the absence of one of the genes and contribute to generating various chromosome rearrangements.
