cloning, sequencing, disruption and phenotypic analysis of uvsc, an aspergillus nidulans homologue of yeast rad.. . we have cloned the uvsc gene of aspergillus nidulans by complementation of the a. nidulans uvsc mutant. the predicted protein uvsc shows .% sequence identity to the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein and .% sequence identity to the escherichia coli reca protein. transcription of uvsc is induced by methyl methane sulphonate (mms), as is transcription of rad of yeast. similar levels of uvsc transcription were observed after mms induction in a uvsc+ strain and the uvsc mutant. the coding sequence of the uvsc allele has a deletion of bp, which results in deletion of two amino acids and replacement of one amino acid in the translation product. in order to gain more insight into the biological function of the uvsc gene, a uvsc null mutant was constructed, in which the entire uvsc coding sequence was replaced by a selectable marker gene. meiotic and mitotic phenotypes of a uvsc+ strain, the uvsc mutant and the uvsc null mutant were compared. the uvsc null mutant was more sensitive to both uv and mms than the uvsc mutant. the uvsc mutant arrested in meiotic prophase i. the uvsc null mutant arrested at an earlier stage, before the onset of meiosis. one possible interpretation of these meiotic phenotypes is that the a. nidulans homologue of rad of yeast has a role both in the specialized processes preceding meiosis and in meiotic prophase i.
