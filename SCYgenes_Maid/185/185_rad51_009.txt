the rad pathway of telomerase independent maintenance of telomeres can amplify tg sequences in yku and cdc mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, cdc, yku, and telomerase define three parallel pathways for telomere end protection that prevent chromosome instability and death by senescence. we report here that cdc ykudelta mutants generated telomere deprotection resistant cells that, in contrast with telomerase negative senescent cells, did not display classical crisis events. cdc ykudelta cells survived telomere deprotection by exclusively amplifying tg( ) repeats (type ii recombination). in a background lacking telomerase (tlcdelta), this process predominated over type i recombination (amplification of subtelomeric y' sequences). strikingly, inactivation of the rad/rad pathway (which is normally required for type ii recombination) in cdc ykudelta or ykudelta tlcdelta mutants, but also in cdc yku(+) tlcdelta mutants, still permitted type ii recombination, but this process was now entirely dependent on the rad pathway. in addition, delayed senescence was observed in cdc ykudelta raddelta and cdc tlcdelta raddelta cells. these results demonstrate that in wild type cells, masking by cdc and yku prevents the rad pathway from amplifying telomeric tg( ) sequences. they also suggest that rad is more efficient than rad in amplifying the sequences left uncovered by the absence of cdc or yku.
