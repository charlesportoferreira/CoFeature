a core activity associated with the n terminus of the yeast rad protein is revealed by rad overexpression suppression of c terminal rad truncation alleles.. . c terminal rad truncation and internal deletion mutants were characterized for their ability to repair mms induced double strand breaks and to produce viable spores during meiosis. the rad delta allele, encoding the n terminal amino acids of the predicted amino acid polypeptide, supports partial activity for both functions. furthermore, rad overexpression completely suppresses the mms sensitivity of a rad delta mutant. the absence of the c terminus in the truncated protein makes it likely that suppression occurs by bypassing the c terminal functions of radp. rad overexpression does not suppress the low level of spore viability that the rad delta allele causes and only partially suppresses the defect in rad alleles encoding the n terminal or amino acids. the results of this study also show that intragenic complementation between rad alleles is governed by a complex relationship that depends heavily on the two alleles involved and their relative dosage. in heteroallelic rad diploids, the rad delta allele does not complement rad missense mutations altering residues or in the n terminus. however, complementation is achieved with each of these missense alleles when the rad delta allele is overexpressed. complementation also occurs between rad delta and an internal deletion allele missing residues through . we suggest that the first amino acids of radp constitute a core domain that provides critical rad activities.
