a recombination repair gene of schizosaccharomyces pombe, rhp, is a functional homolog of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad gene and is phylogenetically related to the human xrcc gene.. . to identify schizosaccharomyces pombe genes involved in recombination repair, we identified seven mutants that were hypersensitive to both methyl methanesulfonate (mms) and gamma rays and that contained mutations that caused synthetic lethality when combined with a rad mutation. one of the mutants was used to clone the corresponding gene from a genomic library by complementation of the mms sensitive phenotype. the gene obtained encodes a protein of amino acids whose sequence is % identical to that of the rad protein of saccharomyces cerevisiae. an rhp (rad homolog of s. pombe) deletion strain was more sensitive to mms, uv, and gamma rays than the wild type strain and showed a reduction in the frequency of mitotic homologous recombination. the mms sensitivity was more severe at lower temperature and was suppressed by the presence of a multicopy plasmid bearing the rhp gene. an rhp rhp double mutant was as sensitive to uv and gamma rays as an rhp single mutant, indicating that rhp function is epistatic to that of rhp. these characteristics of the rhp mutants are very similar to those of s. cerevisiae rad mutants. phylogenetic analysis suggests that rhp and rad are evolutionarily closest to human xrcc of the reca/rad family of proteins.
