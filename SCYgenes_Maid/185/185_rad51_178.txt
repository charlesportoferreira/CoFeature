yeast rad and rad proteins form a heterodimer that functions with replication protein a to promote dna strand exchange by rad recombinase.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae rad, rad, and rad genes, required for genetic recombination and dna double strand break repair, encode proteins homologous to one another and to the escherichia coli reca protein. rad protein catalyzes the dna strand exchange reaction with a dependence on atp and on the heterotrimeric single strand dna (ssdna) binding factor replication protein a (rpa). by several independent criteria, rad and rad encoded products are shown here to exist as a stable heterodimer, with a dissociation constant of &lt; x ( ) m. in strand exchange, the reaction proceeds efficiently if rpa is incorporated after nucleation of rad onto ssdna, but if rpa is present during the nucleation phase, as is likely the case in vivo, the amount of strand exchange products becomes relatively insignificant. inclusion of the rad rad heterodimer with rad and rpa results in a marked stimulation of strand exchange, providing evidence for a role of the rad rad heterodimer in overcoming the inhibitory effect of rpa.
