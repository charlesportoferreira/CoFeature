human rad amino acid residues required for rad binding.. . the rad protein, a homologue of the bacterial reca protein, is an essential factor for both meiotic and mitotic recombination. the n terminal domain of the human rad protein (hsrad) directly interacts with dna. based on a yeast two hybrid analysis, it has been reported that the n terminal region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad protein binds rad;s. cerevisiae rad and rad both activate the homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions. here, we show that the hsrad n terminal region, which corresponds to the rad binding region of scrad, does not exhibit strong binding to the human rad protein (hsrad). to investigate its function, the c terminal region of hsrad was randomly mutagenized. although this region includes the two segments corresponding to the putative dna binding sites of reca, all seven of the mutants did not decrease, but instead slightly increased, the dna binding. in contrast, we found that some of these hsrad mutations significantly decreased the hsrad binding. therefore, we conclude that these amino acid residues are required for the hsrad.hsrad binding. hsrad, as well as s. cerevisiae rad, promoted homologous pairing between ssdna and dsdna, and higher homologous pairing activity was observed in the presence of both hsrad and hsrad than with either hsrad or hsrad alone. the hsrad fv mutation, which strongly impaired the hsrad binding, decreased the homologous pairing in the presence of both hsrad and hsrad, without affecting the homologous pairing by hsrad alone. this result suggests the importance of the hsrad.hsrad interaction in homologous pairing. copyright academic press.
