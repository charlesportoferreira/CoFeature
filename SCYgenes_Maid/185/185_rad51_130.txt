the uvsc and uvse genes of aspergillus nidulans are not required for the mutagenic repair of uv damage.. . the uvsc gene of aspergillus nidulans is a homolog of the rad gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae. however, with respect to its effects on uv mutagenesis, it differs from the yeast gene, since it seems to be required for uv mutagenesis; however, this conclusion is based only on data from resting conidia. to further clarify the functional role of the uvsc gene, we tested the uv mutability of strains bearing a uvsc mutation in resting as well as in germinating conidia, by the p fluorophenyl alanine resistance test. we also evaluated the mutability of the uvse mutant which belongs to the same epistatic group. our results show that the uvsc and uvse genes do not have a significant role in the mutagenic uv repair pathway.
