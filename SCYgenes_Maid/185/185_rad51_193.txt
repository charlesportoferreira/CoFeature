mammalian ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubc interacts with rad recombination protein and localizes in synaptonemal complexes.. . hsubc, a human gene encoding a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, has been cloned. the kda hsubc protein is homologous to the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes hus of schizosaccharomyces pombe and ubc of saccharomyces cerevisiae. the hsubc gene complements a ubc mutation of s. cerevisiae. it has been mapped to chromosome p. and is expressed in many human tissues, with the highest levels in testis and thymus. according to the ga two hybrid system analysis, hsubc protein interacts with human recombination protein rad. a mouse homolog, mmubc, encodes an amino acid sequence that is identical to the human protein. in mouse spermatocytes, mmubc protein, like rad protein, localizes in synaptonemal complexes, which suggests that ubc protein plays a regulatory role in meiosis.
