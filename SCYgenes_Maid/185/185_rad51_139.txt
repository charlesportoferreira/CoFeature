rad deficient vertebrate cells accumulate chromosomal breaks prior to cell death.. . yeast rad mutants are viable, but extremely sensitive to gamma rays due to defective repair of double strand breaks. in contrast, disruption of the murine rad homologue is lethal, indicating an essential role of rad in vertebrate cells. we generated clones of the chicken b lymphocyte line dt carrying a human rad transgene under the control of a repressible promoter and subsequently disrupted the endogenous rad loci. upon inhibition of the rad transgene, rad cells accumulated in the g/m phase of the cell cycle before dying. chromosome analysis revealed that most metaphase arrested rad cells carried isochromatid type breaks. in conclusion, rad fulfils an essential role in the repair of spontaneously occurring chromosome breaks in proliferating cells of higher eukaryotes.
