construction of a pilot human yac library in a recombination defective yeast strain.. . using high molecular weight dna fragments from a human lymphoblastoid cell line, a pilot collection of yacs was constructed in ykk, a recombination deficient strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying mutations in both the rad and rad genes. analysis of clones from the current library by pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed more than % single yacs with an insert size averaging kb. fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) performed with clones on metaphase chromosomes suggested a high proportion mapping at centromeric () or telomeric () locations. the results are consistent with the stabilization of yacs in strains disarmed in recombination functions [kohno, k., oshiro, t., kishine, h., wada, m., takeda, h., ihara, n., imamoto, f., kano, y. and schlessinger, d. () human yacs unstable in a rad single mutant strain become stable in radrad double mutant. gene, , (gene )], and further suggest that the yacs may include regions that have been difficult to clone in other strains.
