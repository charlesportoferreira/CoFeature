binding of radp to dna. interaction of radp with single and double stranded dna.. . like reca, saccharomyces cerevisiae radp promotes strand exchange between circular single stranded dna (ssdna) and linear double stranded dna (dsdna). we have investigated several parameters characteristic of the interaction of radp with ssdna and dsdna, particularly the effects of the nucleotide cofactors atp and adp and the analogs adenosine ' o (thiotriphosphate) (atpgammas) and adenylyl imidodiphosphate (amp pnp). radp binding to both n ethenoadenosine and n ethenocytidine ssdna (epsilondna) and dsdna requires the presence of mg+ and atp; no binding occurs in the presence of adp, amp pnp, or atpgammas. binding of radp to dsdna also requires atp; adp is ineffective, whereas atpgammas and amp pnp are considerably less able to promote binding and only at elevated concentrations of radp. atp binding, not atp hydrolysis, is required for radp binding to dna. the kd values for atp for promoting binding of radp to ssdna and dsdna are and microm, respectively. radp binding occurs with a stoichiometry of one monomer of radp per approximately . nucleotides of epsilondna and approximately . base pairs of dsdna. once formed, radp. ssdna complexes are stable so long as sufficient atp levels are maintained. atp hydrolysis causes dissociation of radp from dna. moreover, the preformed complex is stable in the presence of a fold excess of adp or amp pnp over atp. atpgammas, however, in the same fold excess over atp causes dissociation of the radp. ssdna complex.
