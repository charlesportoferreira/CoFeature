hmre and hrad nuclear foci are induced during the normal cellular response to dna double strand breaks.. . we previously identified a conserved multiprotein complex that includes hmre and hrad. in this study, we used immunofluorescence to investigate the role of this complex in dna double strand break (dsb) repair. hmre and hrad form discrete nuclear foci in response to treatment with dsb inducing agents but not in response to uv irradiation. hmre and hrad foci colocalize after treatment with ionizing radiation and are distinct from those of the dsb repair protein, hrad. our data indicate that an irradiated cell is competent to form either hmre hrad foci or hrad foci, but not both. the multiplicity of hmre and hrad foci is much higher in the dsb repair deficient cell line br than in repair proficient cells. hmre hrad focus formation is markedly reduced in cells derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients, whereas hrad focus formation is markedly increased. these experiments support genetic evidence from saccharomyces cerevisiae indicating that mre rad have roles distinct from that of rad in dsb repair. further, these data indicate that hmre hrad foci form in response to dna dsbs and are dependent upon a dna damage induced signaling pathway.
