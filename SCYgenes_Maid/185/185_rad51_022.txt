the importance of genetic recombination for fidelity of chromosome pairing in meiosis.. . in budding yeast, absence of the hop protein leads to extensive synaptonemal complex (sc) formation between nonhomologous chromosomes, suggesting a crucial role for hop in the proper alignment of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. genetic analysis indicates that hop acts in the same pathway as the rad and dmc proteins, two homologs of e. coli reca. thus, the hop mutant phenotype demonstrates the importance of the recombination machinery in promoting accurate chromosome pairing. we propose that the dmc/rad recombinases require hop to distinguish homologous from nonhomologous sequences during the homology search process. thus, when hop is absent, interactions between nonhomologous sequences become inappropriately stabilized and can initiate sc formation. overexpression of rad largely suppresses the meiotic defects of the dmc and hop mutants. we conclude that rad is capable of carrying out a homology search independently, whereas dmc requires additional factors such as hop.
