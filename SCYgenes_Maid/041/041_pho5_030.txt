an in vitro system recapitulates chromatin remodeling at the pho promoter.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene pho is an excellent system with which to study regulated changes in chromatin structure. the pho promoter is packaged into four positioned nucleosomes under repressing conditions; upon induction, the structure of these nucleosomes is altered such that the promoter dna becomes accessible to nucleases. we report here the development and characterization of an in vitro system in which partially purified pho minichromosomes undergo promoter chromatin remodeling. several hallmarks of the pho chromatin transition in vivo were reproduced in this system. chromatin remodeling of pho minichromosomes required the transcription factors pho and pho, was localized to the promoter region of pho, and was independent of the chromatin remodeling complex swi snf. in vitro chromatin remodeling also required the addition of fractionated nuclear extract and hydrolyzable atp. this in vitro system should serve as a useful tool for identifying the components required for this reaction and for elucidating the mechanism by which the pho promoter chromatin structure is changed.
