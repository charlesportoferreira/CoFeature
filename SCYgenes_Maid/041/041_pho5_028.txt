roles of phosphorylation sites in regulating activity of the transcription factor pho.. . transcription factors are often phosphorylated at multiple sites. here it is shown that multiple phosphorylation sites on the budding yeast transcription factor pho play distinct and separable roles in regulating the factor's activity. phosphorylation of pho at two sites promotes the factor's nuclear export and phosphorylation at a third site inhibits its nuclear import. phosphorylation of a fourth site blocks the interaction of pho with the transcription factor pho. multiple phosphorylation sites provide overlapping and partially redundant layers of regulation that function to efficiently control the activity of pho.
