negative regulatory elements of the saccharomyces cerevisiae pho system. interaction between pho and pho proteins.. . the negative regulatory genes, pho and pho, involved in transcriptional regulation of the yeast repressible acid phosphatase encoding gene, pho, have been cloned. expression of pho and pho has been studied by means of lacz fusions. we show here that these expressions are inorganic phosphate (pi) independent and that they are controlled by the pho gene product; moreover, pho expression is controlled by pho. we also present genetic evidence for an interaction between the pho and pho proteins. increased pho gene dosage partially compensates for the pho mutation and this effect is allele specific. the pho allele has been cloned and sequenced. the mutation changes gly to asp. this region was shown to be essential for pho function by c terminal deletion analysis.
