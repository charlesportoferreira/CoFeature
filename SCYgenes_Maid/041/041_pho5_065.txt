properties and engineering of a mutant sta promoter of saccharomyces diastaticus.. . a new allelic variant of the sta gene of s. diastaticus, designated as stak, was cloned and characterized (; accompanying paper). an application oriented analysis of the promoter region of stak is described, with an emphasis on its peculiar structural feature. a . kb natural deletion located nucleotides upstream of the translation start codon. the strength of the stak promoter was found comparable to that of known strong constitutive yeast promoters (adh, gapdh). regulated glucoamylase expression was demonstrated by chimeric promoters, which were constructed by placing the stak promoter under the control of either the pho or cyc upstream regulatory sequences. on high copy number vectors, induction of the uaspho stak chimeric promoter by phosphate depletion resulted in a destructive overexpression of the secreted glucoamylase, which completely halted cell growth, and promoted cell decay. in contrast, uascyc was shown to mediate a fine tuned regulation both by glucose concentration and, indirectly, by starch, the substrate for the glucoamylase to produce glucose.
