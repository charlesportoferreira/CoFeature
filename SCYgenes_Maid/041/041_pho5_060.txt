functional domains of the regulatory factor pho of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . it is found that minor changes around the basic motif ( ) and the acidic motif ( ) of the pho protein can lead to the constitutive expression of the acid phosphatase gene (pho), and the two motifs work cooperatively. the pho protein has six ankyrin repeats, which are the recognition sites of pho protein with the pho pho protein complex. it is found that the ankyrin repeats ,,, and are important for the pho protein, but the deletion of pro() and leu() in ankyrin repeat does not affect the pho protein. we have found a candidate nucleoplasmin like nuclear location sequence at of the pho protein and the deletion of the corresponding dna fragment inactivates the pho protein. however, when the conservative amino acids arg and lys are constituted by ser and gln, or lys replaced by asn, or arg is turned to ser, the function pho protein is not affected.
