an activation specific role for transcription factor tfiib in vivo.. . a yeast mutant was isolated encoding a single amino acid substitution [serine &gt; proline (sp)] in transcription factor tfiib that impairs activation of the pho gene in response to phosphate starvation. this effect is activation specific because sp did not affect the uninduced level of pho expression, yet is not specific to pho because adr mediated activation of the adh gene also was impaired by sp. pho, the principal activator of pho, directly interacted with tfiib in vitro, and this interaction was impaired by the sp replacement. furthermore, pho induced a conformational change in tfiib, detected by enhanced sensitivity to v protease. the sp replacement also impaired activation of a lexa(op) lacz reporter by a lexa fusion protein to the activation domain of adr, thereby indicating that the transcriptional effect on adh expression is specific to the activation function of adr. these results define an activation specific role for tfiib in vivo and suggest that certain activators induce a conformational change in tfiib as part of their mechanism of transcriptional stimulation.
