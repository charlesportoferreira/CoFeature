high level expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae of an artificial gene encoding a repeated tripeptide aspartyl phenylyalanyl lysine.. . a chemically synthesized gene, which encodes a or times repeated tripeptide, aspartyl phenylalanyl lysine, has been cloned onto the yeast expression vector pam containing the pho promoter. the artificial gene (lap gene) contains the untranslated leader sequence of the e. coli lipoprotein gene (lpp) with its transcription terminator sequence. when yeast ah cells transformed by recombinant plasmid containing repeated tripeptide gene were derepressed in low phosphate medium, the artificial polypeptides were synthesized to the amounts of about % of the total cell protein. sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis indicated that the artificial polypeptides synthesized in yeast have molecular weights ranging from about , and , and have immunoreactivity with the artificial polypeptides expressed in e. coli. the artificial popypeptides in whole cell extract were insoluble and seem to be synthesized as insoluble aggregates. electron microscopy showed the presence of inclusion bodies in the cell. these polypeptides can be hydrolyzed to tripeptides with trypsin or chymotrypsin. these properties along with the high expression and easy separation may make the artificial polypeptides a potential raw material for the production of an artificial sweetener, aspartame.
