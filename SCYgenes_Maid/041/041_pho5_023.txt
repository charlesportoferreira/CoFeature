global histone acetylation and deacetylation in yeast.. . histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases can be targeted to promoters to activate or repress genes. for example, the histone acetyltransferase gcn is part of a yeast multiprotein complex that is recruited by the dna binding activator protein gcn (refs ). the histone deacetylase rpd complex is recruited to dna by the repressor ume (refs , ); similar mechanisms exist in other eukaryotes. however, deletion of rpd also increases expression of the pho gene that is repressed by nucleosomes, and regulated by gcn (ref. ) but not by ume. we have determined whether acetylation and deacetylation are promoter specific at pho, by using antibodies against acetylated lysine residues and chromatin immunoprecipitation to examine the acetylation state of a . kilobase region surrounding the pho gene. here we show that this region is acetylated extensively by esa and gcn and deacetylated by hda and rpd, and that widespread histone modification affects three separate chromosomal regions examined, which total kb. our data indicate that targeted modification occurs in a background of global acetylation and deacetylation that not only reduces basal transcription, but also allows a rapid return to the initial state of acetylation when targeting is removed.
