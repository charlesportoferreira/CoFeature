yeast histone h n terminal sequence is required for promoter activation in vivo.. . to search for histone domains that may regulate transcription in vivo, we made deletions and amino acid substitutions in the histone n termini of s. cerevisiae. histone h n terminal residues , which include the extremely conserved, reversibly acetylated lysines (at positions , , , and ), were found to encompass a region required for the activation of the gal promoter. deletions in the h n terminus reduce gal activation fold. this effect is specific to histone h in that large deletions in the n termini of ha, hb, and h do not similarly decrease induction. activation of the pho promoter is reduced approximately to fold by these h deletions. mutations in histone h acetylation sites and surrounding residues can cause comparable and, in some cases, even greater effects on induction of these two promoters. we postulate that the h n terminus may interact with a component of the transcription initiation complex, allowing nucleosome unfolding and subsequent initiation.
