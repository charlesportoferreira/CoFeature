functional domains of a positive regulatory protein, pho, for transcriptional control of the phosphatase regulon in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the pho gene encodes a positive regulatory factor involved in regulating transcription of various genes in the phosphatase regulon of saccharomyces cerevisiae. besides its own coding region, the . kilobase pho transcript contains a coding region for a mitochondrial protein which does not appear to be translated. four functional domains were found in the pho protein, which consists of amino acid (aa) residues as deduced from the open reading frame of pho. a gel retardation assay with beta galactosidase.pho fused protein revealed that the aa c terminus is the domain responsible for binding to the promoter dna of pho, a gene under the control of pho. this region has similarities with the amphipathic helix loop helix motif of c myc protein. determination of the nucleotide sequences of four phoc mutant alleles and insertion and deletion analyses of pho dna indicated that a region from aa to is involved in interaction with a negative regulatory factor pho. complementation of a pho null allele with the modified pho dnas suggested that the n terminal region ( to aa), which is rich in acidic aa, is the transcriptional activation domain. the deleterious effects of various pho mutations on the constitutive transcription of pho in phoc mutant cells suggested that the region from aa to is involved in oligomerization of the pho protein.
