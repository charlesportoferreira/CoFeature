the yeast hpr gene has a functional role in transcriptional elongation that uncovers a novel source of genome instability.. . the yeast hpr gene plays an important role in genome stability, as indicated by the observation that hpr mutants have high frequencies of dna repeat recombination and chromosome loss. here we report that hpr is required for transcriptional elongation. transcription driven from constitutive and regulated yeast promoters cannot elongate through the bacterial lacz coding region in hprdelta cells, but progresses efficiently through other sequences such as yeast pho. we show that hpr is not required for transcription activation and that the previously reported effects of hprdelta on the activation of different promoters is a consequence of the incapacity of hprdelta cells to elongate transcription through lacz, used as reporter. transcriptional defects are also observed in yeast dna sequences of hprdelta cells in the presence of the transcription elongation inhibitor azauracil. in all cases, the blockage of transcription elongation in hprdelta is associated with both the high frequency of deletions and the increase in plasmid instability that we report here. therefore, in addition to the identification of a new element involved in transcriptional elongation, our work provides evidence for a new source of genomic instability.
