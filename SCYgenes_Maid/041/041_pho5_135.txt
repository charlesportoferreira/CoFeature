a bp segment of the saccharomyces cerevisiae pho upstream activator sequence confers phosphate control to the cyc lacz gene fusion.. . two regions within the saccharomyces cerevisiae pho upstream activator sequence (uas) are involved in phosphate dependent transcription activation [rudolph and hinnen, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa () ]. in experiments carried out in vivo we showed that one of these can compensate for the cyc uas and expresses the heterologous cyc lacz gene in response to phosphate starvation. a bp segment is very efficient in gene activation, and a bp subsegment that corresponds to the uasp consensus sequence brings about a weak but still detectable activation. as was observed with other uas, gene activation is obtained with either orientation of the element, and tandem copies yield double lacz activity compared to a single copy. no gene activation is observed in a pho and in a pho mutant. absence of pho reduces the basal expression of cyc.
