the yeast hrs gene is involved in positive and negative regulation of transcription and shows genetic characteristics similar to sin and gal.. . we provide genetic evidence that hrs/pgd, a yeast gene previously identified as a suppressor of the hyper recombination phenotype of hpr, has positive and negative roles in transcriptional regulation. we have analyzed three differently regulated promoters, gal, pho and hsp, by beta galactosidase assays of lacz fused promoters and by northern analysis of the endogenous genes. transcription of these promoters was derepressed in hrsdelta mutants under conditions in which it is normally repressed in wild type. under induced conditions it was either strongly reduced or significantly enhanced depending on the promoter system analyzed. constitutive transcription was not affected, as determined in adh and tef. in addition, hrsp was required for mating factor expression, telomere linked dna silencing and dna supercoiling of plasmids. furthermore, hrsdelta suppressed ty insertion mutations and conferred a gal phenotype. many of these phenotypes also result from mutations in gal, sin or rgr, which encode proteins of the rna polii mediator. we also show that galdelta and sindelta partially suppress the hyper rec phenotype of hpr mutants, although to a lesser extent than hrsdelta. our results provide new evidence for the connection between hprdelta induced deletions and transcription. we discuss the possibility that hrsp might be a component of the rna polii transcription machinery.
