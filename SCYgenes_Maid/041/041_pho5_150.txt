removal of positioned nucleosomes from the yeast pho promoter upon pho induction releases additional upstream activating dna elements.. . the chromatin fine structure in the promoter region of pho, the structural gene for a strongly regulated acid phosphatase in yeast, was analyzed. an upstream activating sequence bp away from the start of the coding sequence that is essential for gene induction was found to reside in the center of a hypersensitive region under conditions of pho repression. under these conditions three related elements at positions , and are contained within precisely positioned nucleosomes located on both sides of the hypersensitive region. upon pho induction the chromatin structure of the promoter undergoes a defined transition, in the course of which two nucleosomes upstream and two nucleosomes downstream of the hypersensitive site are selectively removed. in this way approximately bp upstream of the pho coding sequence become highly accessible and all four elements are free to interact with putative regulatory proteins. these findings suggest a mechanism by which the chromatin structure participates in the functioning of a regulated promoter.
