bacterial plasmid pbr sequences serve as upstream activating sequences in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the expression of acid phosphatase (apase) from pho and mf alpha pho hybrid genes is regulated by inorganic phosphate and mating type locus respectively, as well as the pho and mat alpha gene products respectively. when pho and mf alpha pho hybrid genes were cloned in the bamhi site of the pbr sequence of the yeast shuttle vectors (yrp or yept), in one orientation they were regulated normally but in the other orientation their expression was not regulated but expressed constitutively. the pbr sequences present upstream of the inserted genes are responsible for the constitutive expression. by replacing the pho upstream activating sequences (uas) element with pbr fragments, we have identified three pbr sequences, from nucleotides to , to and to , which were able to promote expression of apase. a comparison of these three pbr fragments revealed ' atcgcgcgag ' and ' cggtgatgncgg ' to be the common sequences likely to act as uass in saccharomyces cerevisiae. by using synthetic oligonucleotides, it was found that both sequences are required for maximum expression of apase activity.
