amino acid replacement studies of human cytochrome c by a complementation system using cyc deficient yeast.. . various in vitro mutated human cytochrome c genes which encode displaced amino acid residues at the th, th, th, th, th, th, and/or th residues were constructed, and their degrees of complementation of yeast cyc deficiency were examined. invariant cys and arg could not be replaced by alanine and tryptophan, respectively, without function impairment. cytochrome c containing ala instead of conserved cys , gly or lys instead of arg , and ser instead of invariant gly were partly functional. these results indicate that these invariant or conserved residues are important. cytochromes c containing cys instead of native gly was partly functional. cytochrome c containing arg and gly instead of gly and arg was slightly functional. replacement of variable thr and gly by ile and arg , respectively, produced no effects. our results are as a whole consistent with the view that conserved residues are important and variable residues are less important for cytochrome c to function.
