signals that produce ' termini in cyc mrna of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the cyc mutant was previously shown to contain a bp deletion, nucleotides upstream from the major wild type poly(a) site, in the cyc gene, which encodes iso cytochrome c of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. this bp deletion caused a % reduction in the cyc transcripts, which were heterogeneous in size, aberrantly long, and presumably labile (k. s. zaret and f. sherman, cell . , ). site directed mutagenesis in and adjacent to the bp region was used to identify signals involved in the formation and positioning of cyc mrna ' ends. in addition, combinations of various putative ' end forming signals were introduced by in vitro mutagenesis into the ' region of the cyc mutant. the combined results from both studies suggest that ' end formation in yeast cells involves signals having the following three distinct but integrated elements acting in concert. (i) the upstream element, including sequences tatata, tag ... tatgta, and tttttata, which function by enhancing the efficiency of downstream elements; (ii) downstream elements, such as ttaagaac and aagaa, which position the poly(a) site; and (iii) the actual site of polyadenylation, which often occurs after cytidine residues that are ' to the so called downstream element. while the upstream element is required for efficient ' end formation, alterations of the downstream element and poly(a) sites generally do not affect the efficiency of ' end formation but appear to alter the positions of poly(a) sites. in addition, we have better defined the upstream elements by examining various derivatives of tatata and tag ... tatgta, and we have examined the spatial requirements of the three elements by systematically introducing or deleting upstream and downstream elements and cytidine poly(a) sites.
