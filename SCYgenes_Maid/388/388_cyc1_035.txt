ph dependence of formation of a partially unfolded state of a lys &gt; his variant of iso cytochrome c. implications for the alkaline conformational transition of cytochrome c.. . the alkaline conformational transition of a lysine &gt; histidine variant of iso cytochrome c has been studied. the transition has been monitored at nm, a band sensitive to the presence of the heme methionine bond, at the heme soret band which is sensitive to the nature of the heme ligand, and by nmr methods. the guanidine hydrochloride dependence of the alkaline conformational transition has also been monitored. the histidine protein has an unusual biphasic alkaline conformational transition at both nm and the heme soret band, consistent with a three state process. the conformational transition is fully reversible. an equilibrium model has been developed to account for this behavior. with this model, it has been possible to obtain the acid constant for the trigger group, pk(h), of the low ph phase from the equilibrium data. a pk(h) value of . +/ . in h()o was obtained, consistent with a histidine acting as the trigger group. the nmr data for the low ph phase of the alkaline conformational transition are consistent with an imidazole ligand replacing met . for the high ph phase of the biphasic alkaline transition, the nmr data are consistent with lysine being the heme ligand. guanidine hydrochloride m values of . +/ . and . +/ . kcal mol( ) m( ) were obtained for the low and high ph phases of the biphasic alkaline transition of the histidine protein, respectively, consistent with a greater structural disruption for the low ph phase of the transition.
