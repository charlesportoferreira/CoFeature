yeast hap and hap. transcriptional activators in a heteromeric complex.. . transcription of the yeast c upsilon c gene (iso cytochrome c) is regulated in part by the upstream activation site uas. activity of uas requires both the hap and hap activators, which bind to uas in an interdependent manner. to distinguish whether these factors bound to uas cooperatively or formed a complex in the absence of dna, hap and hap were tagged by gene fusion to lexa and beta galactosidase, respectively, and purified through four chromatographic steps. the copurification of lexa hap, hap beta galactosidase, and uas binding activity shows that hap and hap associate in the absence of dna to form a multisubunit activation complex.
