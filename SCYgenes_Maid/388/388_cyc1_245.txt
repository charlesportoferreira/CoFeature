oxygen dependent upstream activation sites of saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome c genes are related forms of the same sequence.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the two genes, cyc and cyc, that encode the isoforms of cytochrome c are expressed at different levels. oxygen regulation is mediated by the expression of the cyp gene, and the cyp protein interacts with both cyc upstream activation sequence (uas) and cyc uaso. in this study, the homology between the cyp binding sites of both genes was investigated. the most noticeable difference between the cyc and cyc uass is the presence of gc base pairs at the same positions in a repeated sequence in cyc compared with cg base pairs in cyc. directed mutagenesis changing these gc residues to cg residues in cyc led to cyc like expression of cyc both in a cyp wild type strain and in a strain carrying the semidominant mutation cyp which reverses the oxygen dependent expression of the two genes. our results strongly support the hypothesis that the cyp binding sites in cyc and cyc are related forms of the same sequence and that the cyp protein has altered specificity for the variant forms of the consensus sequences in both genes.
