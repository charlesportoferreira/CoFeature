transcription initiation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c gene. multiple, independent t a t a sequences.. . the expression of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cyc gene, which encodes iso cytochrome c, produces a family of messenger rnas whose ' ends map in the region from position + to relative to the first nucleotide at position + of the protein coding dna sequence. the mechanism of transcription initiation of the cyc gene has been examined by using linker scanning deletions and gene fusions. the various cyc derivatives with mutations in the ' non coding region were constructed, reintroduced into yeast using a multicopy plasmid, and the mrna starts mapped by primer extension. the results indicate that four, and possibly five t a t a sequences are located within the ' non coding region of the cyc gene, and that each t a t a is required for a specific subset of mrna starts. this conclusion has been confirmed by oligonucleotide mutagenesis of a chromosomal cyc t a t a sequence. a loose spatial relationship also exists between the t a t a sequences and the mrna start sites, and this distance relationship varies from to base pairs (+/ base pairs).
