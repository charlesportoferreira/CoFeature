unusual aspects of in vitro rna processing in the ' regions of the gal, gal, and gal genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a striking feature of the ' end regions in polymerase ii transcripts of saccharomyces cerevisiae adjacent to their processing and polyadenylation sites is the lack of well defined signal elements. nonetheless, essential signals have seemed to be confined to compact regions in vivo, and we find that a short rna with only bases of gal sequence upstream and to bases downstream of the poly(a) addition site is processed in vitro, as is an analogous cyc pre rna. specific polyadenylation of a precleaved species further delimits the poly(a) signal and rules out obligatory coupling between cleavage and poly(a) addition. although little proximal and even less distal sequence is required for accurate cleavage with cyc and gal, we have been unable to identify common features to which processing could be ascribed. we therefore turned to the coregulated set of genes in the galactose cluster (gal, gal, and gal) to assay their corresponding pre mrnas in vitro, in hopes of finding a common theme. by contrast to gal, short pre mrnas corresponding to gal and gal fail to be cleaved detectably, and only much longer transcripts are susceptible to processing. this indicates that signals, even if preserved, are more widely dispersed than the poly(a) addition site, and these results are unchanged whether extracts are from cells grown on glucose or galactose. as a further surprise, rnas corresponding to the antisense orientation of the ' end regions of all three gal genes are also effective substrates for the processing machinery in vitro. computer analysis reveals the presence of polydisperse dyad symmetries that might account for these observations.
