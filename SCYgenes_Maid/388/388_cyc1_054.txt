evidence of an overlap between the two half sites of uas b/cyc a new model for cypp (happ) dna binding.. . cypp (happ) is a yeast transcriptional regulator belonging to the zinc cluster family. cggnnntancgg was identified by pcr selection as the dna sequence allowing its optimal binding. nevertheless, this sequence is not a consensus sequence, the simultaneous presence of the two cggs and the ta generally not being found in the known natural cypp targets. in fact, our previous studies showed that the mechanism of cypp dna binding was target dependent. data concerning the binding of cypp to the uas b/cyc are presented here. this target, containing the cggggtttacgg sequence, was found to present the particular ability of stabilizing the binding of only one molecule of some monomeric cypp fragments. this property was used to investigate the actual contribution of the tt and cgg sequences in the binding of cypp. our results indicate that each cgg belongs to a different half site and, in contrast to a previous hypothesis, that the t nucleotide located four bases downstream from the left cgg is essential for the binding of one monomer to each half site. the two half sites of the uas b/cyc thus overlap.
