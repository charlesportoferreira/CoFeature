the role of a conserved water molecule in the redox dependent thermal stability of iso cytochrome c.. . eukaryotic cytochromes c contain a buried water molecule (wat) next to the heme that is associated through a network of hydrogen bonds to three invariant residues. tyrosine , asparagine , and threonine . single site mutations to two of these residues (yf, ni, na) and the double site mutation (yf/ni) were introduced into saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c to disrupt the hydrogen bonding network associated with wat. the ni and yf/ni mutations lead to a loss of wat while na and yf modifications lead to the addition of a new water molecule (wat) at an adjacent site (berghuis, a. m., guillemette, j. g., mclendon, g., sherman, f., smith, m., and brayer, g. d. () j. mol. biol. , ; berghuis, a. m., guillemette, j. g., smith, m., and brayer, g. d. () j. mol. biol. , ; rafferty, s. p., guillemette, j. g., berghuis, a. m., smith, m., brayer, g. d., and mauk, a. g. () biochemistry, , ). we used differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) to determine the change in heat capacity (deltacp) and the temperature dependent enthalpy (deltahvh) for the thermal denaturation of both the oxidized and reduced forms of the iso cytochrome c variants. the relative stabilities were expressed as the difference in the free energy of denaturation (deltagd) between the wild type and mutant proteins in both redox states. the disruption of the hydrogen bonding network results in increased stability for all of the mutant proteins in both redox states with the exception of the reduced yf variant which has approximately the same stability as the reduced wild type protein. for the oxidized proteins, deltagd values of ., ., ., and . kcal/mol were determined for na, ni, yf, and yf/ni, respectively. the oxidized proteins were . . kcal/mol less stable than the reduced proteins due to a redox dependent increase in the entropy of unfolding.
