guanidine hydrochloride induced equilibrium unfolding of mutant forms of iso cytochrome c with replacement of proline .. . proline , an evolutionally conserved residue that separates two short alpha helical regions, is replaced by valine, threonine, or isoleucine in at least partially functional forms of iso cytochrome c from saccharomyces cerevisiae [ernst, j. f., hampsey, d. m., stewart, j. w., rackovsky, s., goldstein, d., &amp; sherman, f. () j. biol. chem. , ]. treatment of these proteins with a specific sulfhydryl blocking reagent (methyl methanethiosulfonate) to block cys has allowed investigation of the properties of monomeric forms of the proteins, denoted iso ms. comparison of the uv visible absorbance properties (ph , degrees c) shows minor differences between the normal pro iso ms and two of the three mutant proteins. the val iso ms protein has absorbance properties indistinguishable from those of the normal pro iso ms protein, but the ile iso ms and thr iso ms proteins show reduced intensity of the nm absorbance band and a small shift in the soret maximum, from nm for the pro iso ms and val iso ms proteins to nm for the thr iso ms and ile iso ms proteins. second derivative spectroscopy is used to assess differences in the polarity of the environment of tyrosine residues. the average degree of exposure of tyrosines to solvent is similar in all four proteins. . for the normal pro iso ms and val iso ms proteins; . for the ile iso ms protein.(abstract truncated at words)
