yeast iso cytochrome c. a . a resolution three dimensional structure determination.. . a molecular replacement approach, augmented with the results of predictive modeling procedures, solvent accessibility studies, packing analyses and translational coefficient searches, has been used to elucidate the . a ( a = . nm) resolution structure of yeast iso cytochrome c. an examination of the polypeptide chain folding of this protein shows it to have unique conformations in three regions, upon comparison with the structures of other eukaryotic cytochromes c. these include. residues to + at the n terminal end of the polypeptide chain, which are in an extended conformation and project in large part off the surface of the protein; residues to , which form a surface beta loop on the his ligand side of the central heme group; and, the c terminal end of the helical segment composed of residues to , which serves to form a part of the heme pocket. structural studies also show that the highly reactive sulfhydryl group of cys is buried within a hydrophobic region in the monomer form of yeast iso cytochrome c. dimerization of yeast iso cytochrome c through disulfide bond formation between two such residues would require a substantial conformational change in the c terminal helix of this protein. another unique structural feature, the trimethylated side chain of lys, is located on the surface of yeast iso cytochrome c near the solvent exposed edge of the bound heme prosthetic group. on the basis of the results of these and other structural studies, an analysis of the spatial conservation of structural features in the heme pocket of eukaryotic cytochromes c has been conducted. it was found that the residues involved could be divided into three general classes. the current structural analyses and additional modeling studies have also been used to explain the altered functional properties observed for mutant yeast iso cytochrome c proteins.
