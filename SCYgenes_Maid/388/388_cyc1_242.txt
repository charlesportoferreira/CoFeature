cyp (hap) regulator of oxygen dependent gene expression in yeast. i. overall organization of the protein sequence displays several novel structural domains.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the cyp gene that modulates the expression of iso (cyc) and iso cytochrome c (cyp) structural genes gives rise to two classes of mutated alleles; one class, represented by cyp , has opposite effects on cyc and cyp, it reduces the expression of cyc while it stimulates that of cyp. the other class, represented by cyp or the related allele hap , reduces the expression of both cyc and cyp genes. genetic data suggested that the cyp product is a positive regulator of the cytochrome c genes. the cyp allele has been cloned. we show here that the iso overproducer function of cyp is included in a base xhoi psti fragment. the sequence of this fragment reveals a unique, long, uninterrupted open reading frame of nucleotides able to encode a protein of amino acid residues. the predicted product of this open reading frame contains several interesting features. the n terminal part of the protein resembles a nucleic acid binding domain, in which two domains can be distinguished. the first is similar to a &quot;finger&quot; dna binding motif, as found in tfiiia and other regulatory proteins. the second consists of seven tandemly repeated sequences with a kcpvdh motif. because of its structure, it is tempting to speculate that this region may act as a &quot;redox sensor&quot; folded around a metal atom or heme and involved in recognition of respiratory effectors. these two domains are separated by an &quot;opa&quot; sequence of gln residues. implication of these domains for the function of cyp is discussed.
