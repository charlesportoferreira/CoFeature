probing the high affinity site of beef heart cytochrome c oxidase by cross linking.. . a covalent complex between cytochrome c oxidase and saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c (called caa) has been prepared at low ionic strength. subunit iii cys of beef heart cytochrome c oxidase cross links by disulphide bond formation to thionitrobenzoate modified yeast cytochrome c, a derivative shown to bind into the high affinity site for substrate [fuller, darley usmar and capaldi () biochemistry , ]. stopped flow experiments show that () covalently bound yeast cytochrome c cannot donate electrons to cytochrome oxidase, whereas oxidation of exogenously added cytochrome c and electron transfer to cytochrome a are only slightly affected; () the steady state reduction levels of cytochrome c and cytochrome a in the covalent complex caa are higher than those found in the native aa enzyme. however, () k(m) and vmax values obtained from the non linear eadie hofstee plots are very similar in both caa and aa. the results imply that cytochrome c bound to the high affinity site is not in a configuration optimal for electron transfer.
