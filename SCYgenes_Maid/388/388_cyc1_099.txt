cytochrome c peroxidase catalyzed oxidation of yeast iso ferrocytochrome c by hydrogen peroxide. ionic strength dependence of the steady state parameters.. . the cytochrome c peroxidase catalyzed oxidation of yeast iso ferrocytochrome c by hydrogen peroxide can be understood on the basis of a mechanism involving two cytochrome c binding sites on cytochrome c peroxidase. values of the equilibrium dissociation constants for both the high and low affinity binding sites determined from the steady state kinetic measurements agree well with published values obtained by vastly different techniques, providing strong support for the two binding site mechanism. maximum enzyme turnover via oxidation of cytochrome c bound at the high affinity site increases from to s as the ionic strength is increased from . to . m. oxidation of yeast iso ferrocytochrome c is faster in the . complexes of cytochrome c peroxidase compounds i and ii in comparison to the . complexes. the oxidation rates in the . complex are macroscopic rate constants equal to the sum of the oxidation rates via both the high and low affinity sites. the maximum enzyme turnover via the . complex increases from to s over the ionic strength range . . m.
