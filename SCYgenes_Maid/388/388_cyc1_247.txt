yeast hap activator competes with the factor rc for binding to the upstream activation site uas of the cyc gene.. . we show that the yeast hap activator locus encodes a protein that binds in vitro to the upstream activation site, uas, of the cyc gene (iso cytochrome c). binding of wild type hap and truncated hap derivatives to uas is evident in crudely fractionated yeast extracts using the gel electrophoresis dna binding assay. the binding of hap in vitro, like the activity of uas in vivo, is stimulated by heme. hap binds to region b, one of two portions of uas shown to be important by genetic analysis of the site. surprisingly, hap binds to the same sequence as a second factor, rc. both hap and rc bind to the same side of the helix, and make similar but not identical major and minor groove contacts that span two full turns. an additional factor that binds to the second important part of uas, the region a factor (raf), is also identified. a model depicting the interplay of hap, rc, and raf in the control of uas is presented.
