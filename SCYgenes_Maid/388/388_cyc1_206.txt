electrochemical, kinetic, and circular dichroic consequences of mutations at position of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . replacement of phe in yeast iso cytochrome c with tyr, leu, ile, ser, ala, and gly produces a gradation of effects on () the reduction potential of the protein, () the rate of reaction with fe(edta) , and () the cd spectra of the ferricytochromes in the soret region under conditions where contributions from the alkaline forms of these proteins are absent. the reduction potential of cytochrome c is lowered by as little as mv (tyr ) or by as much as mv (gly ; ph .) as the result of these substitutions. the second order rate constants for reduction of these cytochromes range from a low of . () x () for the tyr variant to a high of . x () m s for the ser variant [ph ., degrees c, mu = . m (sodium phosphate)]. analysis of these rates by use of relative marcus theory produces values of kcorr that range from . m s for the wild type protein to m s for the gly mutant [ degrees c, mu = . m, ph . (sodium phosphate)]. reinvestigation of the effect of substituting phe by a tyr residue on the cd spectrum of the protein now reveals little alteration of the intense, negative cotton effect in the soret cd spectrum of ferricytochrome c. on the other hand, substitution of nonaromatic residues of various sizes at this position results in loss of this spectroscopic feature, consistent with previous findings.(abstract truncated at words)
