effect of ph on formation of a nativelike intermediate on the unfolding pathway of a lys &gt; his variant of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . previous work on a lys &gt; his (h) variant of iso cytochrome c at ph . [godbole et al. () biochemistry , ] showed that this variant unfolds through a nativelike intermediate that has properties consistent with replacement of the met heme ligand by his . here, the ph dependence of the equilibrium unfolding of the wild type (wt) and h proteins have been investigated, since a characteristic ph dependence is expected for the stability of an intermediate stabilized by histidine heme ligation. stability has been evaluated using guanidine hydrochloride and ph denaturation methods. above ph , the m values from guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the wt and h variants remain significantly different, consistent with continued population of this intermediate. at ph . the m values for the two proteins are within error the same. to assess stability at lower ph, acid denaturation was carried out. the midpoint is about . for both proteins but the transition is broader for the h protein, suggestive of intermediates again being populated during the unfolding of the h protein at this lower ph. heme ligation by met was monitored ( nm absorbance) during gdnhcl (ph . and .) and acid denaturation, confirming, respectively, the absence and presence of intermediates. a thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that this complex ph dependence for the presence of histidine ligation induced intermediates is expected and implicates a titratable group with a pka of approximately .. the analysis also demonstrates when the ph dependences of global stability and stability of an intermediate differ significantly, population of folding intermediates as a function of ph will show novel behavior.
