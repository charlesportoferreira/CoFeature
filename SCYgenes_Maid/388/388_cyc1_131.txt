yeast gal protein is a distinctive type transcription factor that enhances basal transcription in vitro.. . the yeast auxiliary transcription factor gal, a candidate for the coactivator, was partially purified from yeast cells, and its function was characterized in a cell free transcription system. the partially purified gal protein stimulated basal transcription from the cyc core promoter by a factor of at the step of preinitiation complex formation. gal protein also enhanced transcription activated by general regulatory factor , gal ah, or gal vp to the same extent as the basal transcription. therefore, the apparent potentiation of the activators by gal was attributable to the stimulation of basal transcription. the wild type gal protein (but not a mutant type protein) produced in bacteria stimulated transcription as effectively as gal from yeast. these results suggest that gal functions as a positive cofactor of basal and activator induced transcription in a cell free transcription system.
