dna sequences of frameshift and other mutations induced by icr in yeast.. . icr induced mutations in the cyc gene of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated by genetic and dna sequence analyses. genetic analysis of cyc mutations induced by icr and sequence analysis of eight representatives demonstrated that over one third were frameshift mutations that occurred at one site corresponding to amino acid positions , whereas the remaining mutations were distributed more or less randomly, and a few of these were not frameshift mutations. the sequence results indicate that icr primarily induces g.c additions at sites containing monotonous runs of three g.c base pairs. however, some (formula. see text) sites within the cyc gene were not mutated by icr . thus, icr is a relatively specific mutagen that preferentially acts on certain sites with monotonous runs of g.c base pairs.
