intracomplex electron transfer between ruthenium cytochrome b and position variants of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . we tested the idea that the aromatic ring on the invariant residue phe in cytochrome c acts as an electron transfer bridge between cytochrome c and cytochrome b. ru cyt b was prepared by labeling the single sulfhydryl group on tc cytochrome b with [ (bromomethyl) ' methylbipyridine][bis(bipyridine)]ruthenium + as previously described [willie, a., stayton, p.s., sligar, s.g., durham, b., &amp; millett, f. () biochemistry , ]. laser excitation of the complex formed between ru cyt b and saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c at low ionic strength results in rapid electron transfer from the excited state ru(ii*) to the heme group of ru cyt b followed by biphasic electron transfer to the heme group of cytochrome c with rate constants of (. +/ .) x () s and (. +/ .) x () s . variants of iso cytochrome c substituted at phe with tyr, gly, leu, and ile have fast phase rate constants of ., ., ., and . x () s and slow phase rate constants of ., ., ., and . x () s , respectively. increasing the ionic strength to mm results in single phase intracomplex electron transfer with rate constants of ., ., ., ., and . x () s for the wild type, tyr, gly, leu, and ile variants, respectively. these results demonstrate that an aromatic side chain at residue is not needed for rapid electron transfer with cytochrome b. furthermore, two conformational forms of the complex are present at low ionic strength with fast and slow electron transfer rates.(abstract truncated at words)
