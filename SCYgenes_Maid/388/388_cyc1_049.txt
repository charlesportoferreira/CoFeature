rational design of a more stable yeast iso cytochrome c.. . yeast iso cytochrome c is one of the least stable mitochondrial cytochromes c. we have used a coordinated approach, combining the known functional and structural properties of cytochromes c, to engineer mutations into yeast iso cytochrome c with the goal of selectively increasing the stability of the protein. the two redox forms of the native protein and six different mutant forms of yeast iso cytochrome c were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (dsc). the relative stability, expressed as the difference in the gibb's free energy of denaturation at a given temperature between the native and mutant forms (deltadeltag(tref)), was determined for each of the proteins. in both oxidation states, the mutant proteins ct, te/ct, ta/ct, and te/ta/ct were more stable than the wild type protein, respectively. the increased stability of the mutant proteins is proposed to be due to the removal of a rare surface cysteine and the stabilization of two distorted alpha helices.
