cu(ii) binding properties of a cytochrome c with a synthetic metal binding site. his x his in an alpha helix.. . a metal binding site consisting of two histidines positioned his x his in an alpha helix has been engineered into the surface of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c. the synthetic metal binding cytochrome c retains its biological activity in vivo. its ability to bind chelated cu(ii) has been characterized by partitioning in aqueous two phase polymer systems containing a polymer metal complex, cu(ii)ida peg, and by metal affinity chromatography. the stability constant for the complex formed between cu(ii)ida peg and the cytochrome c his x his site is . x () m , which corresponds to a chelate effect that contributes . kcal mol to the binding energy. incorporation of the his x his site yields a synthetic metal binding protein whose metal affinity is sensitive to environmental conditions that alter helix structure or flexibility.
