one and two dimensional proton nmr studies of cys s methylated yeast isozyme ferricytochrome c.. . the effect of s methylating cysteine (cys ) (sh ssch) of yeast isozyme (iso ) ferricytochrome c has been studied using proton nmr spectroscopy. cosy, noesy, and one dimensional nuclear overhauser effect (noe) difference spectroscopies have all been used. the nmr spectrum of this derivative is very similar to that of native yeast iso ferricytochrome c. the advantage of using the cys s methylated derivative is that it is unable to spontaneously dimerize in solution, like native iso monomer does. this makes the derivative a simple, ideal protein for long nmr experiments. this work yields many proton resonance assignments for s methylated yeast iso monomer and confirms all of the assignments for iso monomer that were previously made using only the one dimensional noe method.
