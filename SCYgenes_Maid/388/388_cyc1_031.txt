determinants of cytochrome c pro apoptotic activity. the role of lysine trimethylation.. . cytochrome c released from vertebrate mitochondria engages apoptosis by triggering caspase activation. we previously reported that, whereas cytochromes c from higher eukaryotes can activate caspases in xenopus egg and mammalian cytosols, iso and iso cytochromes c from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae cannot. here we examine whether the inactivity of the yeast isoforms is related to a post translational modification of lysine , n epsilon trimethylation. this modification was found to abrogate pro apoptotic activity of metazoan cytochrome c expressed in yeast. however, iso cytochrome c lacking the trimethylation modification also was devoid of pro apoptotic activity. thus, both lysine trimethylation and other features of the iso sequence preclude pro apoptotic activity. competition studies suggest that the lack of pro apoptotic activity was associated with a low affinity for apaf . as cytochromes c that lack apoptotic function still support respiration, different mechanisms appear to be involved in the two activities.
