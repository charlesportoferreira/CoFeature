identification and characterization of genes that are required for the accelerated degradation of mrnas containing a premature translational termination codon.. . in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes nonsense mutations in a gene can enhance the decay rate of the mrna transcribed from the gene, a phenomenon described as nonsense mediated mrna decay. in yeast, the products of the upf and upf genes are required for this decay pathway, and in this report we focus on the identification and characterization of additional factors required for rapid decay of nonsense containing mrnas. we present evidence that the product of the upf gene is a new factor involved in this decay pathway. mutation of the upf gene or deletion of it from the chromosome resulted in stabilization of nonsense containing mrnas, whereas the decay of wild type transcripts was not affected. the upf gene was isolated, and its transcript was characterized. our results demonstrate that the upf gene encodes a putative . kd protein with an acidic region at its carboxyl terminus ( d e)n found in many nucleolar and transcriptional activator proteins. the upf transcript is nucleotides in length and contains an intron near its ' end. the upf gene is dispensable for vegetative growth, but upf delta strains were found to be more sensitive to the translational elongation inhibitor cycloheximide than upf+. a genetic analysis of other alleles proposed to be involved in nonsense mediated mrna decay revealed that the upf gene is allelic to the previously identified sua allele, a suppressor of an out of frame atg insertion shown previously to reduce translational initiation from the normal atg of the cyc gene. in addition, we demonstrate that another suppressor of this cyc mutation, sua, is allelic to upf, a previously identified lesion involved in nonsense mediated mrna decay.
