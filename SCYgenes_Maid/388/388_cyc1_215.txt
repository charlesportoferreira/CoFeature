mutation induced perturbation of the cytochrome c alkaline transition.. . the possible influence of residue phe in the cytochrome c alkaline isomerization has been evaluated by spectrophotometric ph titrations of a family of mutant yeast iso cytochromes c in which the identity of the residue at this position has been varied. the pka for the exchange of the met heme iron ligand was determined from ph titrations in which the s fe charge transfer band ( nm) was monitored and was found to be . for the wild type, . for ser , . for gly , . for leu , and . for ile . ph jump experiments [davis et al. () j. biol. chem. , ] established that substitutions at position affect the alkaline isomerization by lowering the pka of the titrating group by as much as . pk units; for the ser and gly variants, there is also a small effect on the keq for the ligand exchange equilibrium. on the basis of these findings, we conclude that one critical role for phe in the wild type protein is stabilization of the native heme binding environment.
