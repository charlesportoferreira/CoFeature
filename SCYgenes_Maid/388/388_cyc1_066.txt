phylogenetic relationships of fungal cytochromes c.. . the cyc gene encoding cytochrome c in the yeast candida albicans was cloned by complementation of a cytochrome c deficient mutant of saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its dna sequence was determined. the analysis of the amino acid sequences of cytochrome c from fungal species and two isoforms from s. cerevisiae revealed sequences unique to fungi, and revealed a phylogenetic relationship with a pronounced divergence between schizosaccharomyces pombe and other ascomycetous budding yeast.
