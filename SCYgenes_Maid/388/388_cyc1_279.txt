a positive regulatory site and a negative regulatory site control the expression of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cyc gene.. . a series of bal deletions were constructed in vitro in the upstream region of the saccharomyces cerevisiae cyc gene, encoding the iso cytochrome c protein. these deletions identified two sites which play a role in governing the expression of this gene. a positive site, the deletion of which led to decreased cyc expression, lay ca. base pairs ' to the translational initiation codon ( ). a negative site, the deletion of which led to greatly increased levels of cyc expression, lay at ca. bp. deletion of both these sites resulted in low wild type like expression of the gene. therefore, these two sites appear to act antagonistically to give the low wild type levels of cyc expression. within the region defined as containing the positive site, there is a sequence which bears some homology to the upstream activation sites in the regulated gene, cyc, encoding the iso cytochrome c protein.
