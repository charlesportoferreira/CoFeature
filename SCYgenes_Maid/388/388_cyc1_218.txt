identification and characterization of hap. a third component of the ccaat bound hap/hap heteromer.. . the cyc gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae is positively regulated by the hap and hap proteins, which form a heteromeric complex that binds to a ccaat box in the upstream activation site, uas, and which activate transcription in a nonfermentable carbon source. we carried out a genetic analysis to identify additional trans acting regulatory factors exerting their effects through uas. we present the identification and characterization of a new locus, hap, which is shown to encode a subunit of the dna binding complex at uas. in the hap mutant, the binding of hap and hap (hap/) is not observed in vitro. the hap gene is regulated transcriptionally by a carbon source, suggesting that it encodes a regulatory subunit of the bound complex. the sequence of hap shows a highly acidic region, which innactivated the protein when deleted. replacement of this region with the activation domain of gal restored activity, suggesting that it provides the principal activation domain to the bound hap// complex.
