effects of surface amino acid replacements in cytochrome c peroxidase on intracomplex electron transfer from cytochrome c.. . transient absorption techniques were used to measure the intracomplex electron transfer rates between four recombinant yeast cytochrome c peroxidases and iso cytochrome c (cytc). the binding affinities and catalytic activities with cytc were previously examined [corin et al. () biochemistry , ]. the four include a wild type peroxidase (eccp) and three others, each of which has one surface aspartic acid converted to lysine at position , , or . these sites have been suggested to be within or proximal to the recognition site for cytc. these mutants conduct electron transfer with cytc but differ with respect to the ionic strength profiles of their limiting rate constants. at ph and mu = mm, eccp and dk show similar limiting rate constants for electron transfer with cytc, k(lim), of ca. s . in the same peroxidase concentration range, the dk mutant exhibits a k(obs) of ca. s . instability of the compound i form of dk prevented a complete study of the intracomplex kinetics of this mutant by this technique. at ph and low ionic strength ( mm), dk exhibits a dramatic increase in k(obs) to ca. s while the other two recombinants show a marked decrease to values &lt; s . dk displays much lower affinity for cytc than do the other peroxidases at higher ionic strengths [hake et al. () j. am. chem. soc. , ], thus preventing adequate complexation necessary for efficient electron transfer. variations in binding affinity do not explain the more subtle ionic strength kinetic profile observed for dk.(abstract truncated at words)
