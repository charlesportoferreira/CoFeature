independent functions of yeast pcfp in pre mrna ' end processing and in transcription termination.. . pcfp, an essential subunit of the yeast cleavage factor ia, is required for pre mrna ' end processing, binds to the c terminal domain (ctd) of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) and is involved in transcription termination. we show that the conserved ctd interaction domain (cid) of pcfp is essential for cell viability. interestingly, the ctd binding and ' end processing activities of pcfp can be functionally uncoupled from each other and provided by distinct pcfp fragments in trans. impaired ctd binding did not affect the ' end processing activity of pcfp and a deficiency of pcfp in ' end processing did not prevent ctd binding. transcriptional run on analysis with the cyc gene revealed that loss of cleavage activity did not correlate with a defect in transcription termination, whereas loss of ctd binding did. we conclude that pcfp is a bifunctional protein and that transcript cleavage is not an obligatory step prior to rnap ii termination.
