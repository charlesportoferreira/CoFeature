disruption of the cytochrome c gene in xylose utilizing yeast pichia stipitis leads to higher ethanol production.. . the xylose utilizing yeast, pichia stipitis, has a complex respiratory system that contains cytochrome and non cytochrome alternative electron transport chains in its mitochondria. to gain primary insights into the alternative respiratory pathway, a cytochrome c gene (pscyc, accession no. af) was cloned from wild type p. stipitis cbs by cross hybridization to cyc from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the bp open reading frame of pscyc showed % and % identity to sccyc and sccyc, respectively, at the dna level. disruption of pscyc resulted in a mutant that uses the salicylhydroxamic acid (sham) sensitive respiratory pathway for aerobic energy production. cytochrome spectra revealed that cytochromes c and a.a() both disappeared in the cyc delta mutant, so no electron flow through the cytochrome c oxidase was possible. the cyc delta mutant showed % lower growth rates than the parent when grown on fermentable sugars. the cyc delta mutant was also found to be unable to grow on glycerol. interestingly, the mutant produced . g/g ethanol from % xylose, which was % higher in yield than the parental strain (. g/g). these results suggested that the alternative pathway might play an important role in supporting xylose conversion to ethanol under oxygen limiting conditions. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
