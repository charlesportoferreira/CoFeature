the sua suppressors of saccharomyces cerevisiae encode replacements of conserved residues within the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii and affect transcription start site selection similarly to sua (tfiib) mutations.. . mutations in the saccharomyces cerevisiae sua gene were found to be suppressors of an aberrant atg translation initiation codon in the leader region of the cyc gene. analysis of cyc transcripts from sua mutants revealed that suppression is a consequence of diminished transcription initiation at the normal start sites in favor of initiation at downstream sites, including a site between the aberrant and normal atg start codons. this effect is not cyc gene specific since initiation at other genes, including adh, cyc, and his, was similarly affected, although initiation at his and spt was unaffected. the sua gene was cloned and partially sequenced, revealing identity to rpb, which encodes the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii. the sua suppressors are the result of single amino acid replacements of highly conserved residues. three replacements were found either within or immediately preceding homology block d, and a fourth was found adjacent to homology block h, indicating that these regions play a role in defining start sites in vivo. nearly identical effects on start site selection were observed for sua suppressors, which encode altered forms of tfiib. synthetic lethality was associated with double sua sua suppressor mutations, and recessive sua mutants failed to fully complement recessive sua mutants in heterozygous diploids (nonallelic noncomplementation). these data indicate that the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii and tfiib are important determinants of transcription start site selection in s. cerevisiae and suggest that this function might be conferred by interaction between these two proteins.
