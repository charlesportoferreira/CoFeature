sequence requirement for trimethylation of yeast cytochrome c.. . lysine (using the vertebrate numbering system) is trimethylated in cytochromes c from fungi and plants but not from higher animals. we have investigated the characteristics of an amino acid sequence required for trimethylation of lysine by examining altered iso cytochromes c from saccharomyces cerevisiae having single replacements in the region encompassing residues through . these results indicated that tyrosine is critical for trimethylation of lysine , whereas replacements at other positions did not produce significant diminutions. various replacements of tyrosine resulted in different levels of inhibition, with the yf replacement causing no significant reduction, and the ye and yk replacements completely or almost completely preventing trimethylation of lysine . however, other similarly spaced lysine and tyrosine residues at other sites in the protein did not result in trimethylation of the lysine residue. thus, a properly situated aromatic residue, determined by the overall conformation of apocytochrome c in the vicinity of lysine , appears to be essential for trimethylation.
