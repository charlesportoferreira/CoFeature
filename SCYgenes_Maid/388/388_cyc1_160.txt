isolation and characterization of sua, a novel gene required for normal growth in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have identified the sua locus as a suppressor of an aberrant atg codon located in the leader region of the cyc gene. the sua allele enhances the iso cytochrome c steady state level in the cyc mutant from % to approximately % of normal (cyc+) and also confers a marked slow growth (slg ) phenotype. suppression is not a consequence of altered transcription initiation at the cyc locus. the sua wild type gene was isolated and sequenced, revealing an open reading frame (orf) encoding a potential protein of , da. sua transcript analyses were consistent with expression of the predicted orf and sua antisera detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of kda. sua was mapped to chromosome vii, immediately adjacent to the pmr gene. hybridization analysis revealed the presence of a related gene on chromosome xii. neither the sua dna sequence nor deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to any sequences in the data banks. disruption of sua conferred the same cyc+ and slg phenotypes as the sua suppressor, which is the result of a missense mutation, encoding a ser phe replacement. in addition, sua null mutants lack cytochrome a.a and fail to grow on lactate or glycerol medium. these results define sua as a new gene encoding a novel protein that is necessary for normal cell growth.
