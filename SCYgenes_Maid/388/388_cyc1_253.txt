the overproducing cyp and the underproducing hap mutations are alleles of the same gene which regulates in trans the expression of the structural genes encoding iso cytochromes c.. . the cyp gene has previously been identified as coding for a positive trans active factor that activates the expression of cyc and cyp, which are the structural genes for isol and iso cytochrome c. two phenotypically distinct classes of cyp mutations can be obtained indicating that cyc and cyp are differentially regulated by the product of cyp. the hap gene codes for a product which has previously been proved to be necessary for the expression of the heme dependent cyc uas cis regulatory sequence. in this article, we show by complementation and recombination that cyp and hap are the same gene, moreover we identify hap as an iso cytochrome c underproducer mutation of the cyp gene.
