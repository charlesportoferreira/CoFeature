hydrogen exchange behavior of [u n] labeled oxidized and reduced iso cytochrome c.. . heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy was used to measure the hydrogen deuterium exchange rates of backbone amide hydrogens in both oxidized and reduced [u n]iso cytochrome c from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the exchange data confirm previously reported data [marmorino et al. () protein sci. , ], resolve several inconsistencies, and provide more thorough coverage of exchange rates throughout the cytochrome c protein in both oxidation states. combining the data previously collected on unlabeled ct with the current data collected on [u n]ct, exchange rates for protons in the oxidized state and protons in the reduced state can now be reported. most significantly, hydrogen exchange measurements on [u n]iso cytochrome c allowed the observation of exchange behavior of the secondary structures, such as large loops, that are not extensively hydrogen bonded. for the helices, the most slowly exchanging protons are found in the middle of the helix, with more rapidly exchanging protons at the helix ends. the observation for the omega loops in cytochrome c is just the opposite. in the loops, the ends contain the most slowly exchanging protons and the loop middles allow more rapid exchange. this is found to be true in cytochrome c loops, even though the loop ends are not attached to any regular secondary structures. some of the exchange data are strikingly inconsistent with data collected on the cs variant at a different ph, which suggests ph dependent dynamic differences in the protein structure. this new hydrogen exchange data for loop residues could have implications for the substructure model of eukaryotic cytochrome c folding. isotopic labeling of variant forms of cytochrome c can now be used to answer many questions about the structure and folding of this model protein.
