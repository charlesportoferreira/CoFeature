enhanced stability in vivo of a thermodynamically stable mutant form of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . previous work has established that the ni amino acid replacement in iso cytochrome c from the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae causes an unprecedented increase in thermodynamic stability of the protein in vitro, whereas the ng replacement diminishes stability. spectrophotometric measurements of intact cells revealed that the ni iso cytochrome c is present at higher than normal levels in vivo. although iso cytochrome c turnover is negligible during aerobic growth, transfer of fully derepressed, aerobically grown cells to anaerobic growth conditions leads to reduction in the levels of all of the cytochromes. pulse chase experiments carried out under these anaerobic conditions demonstrated that the ni iso cytochrome c has a longer half life than the normal protein. this is the first report of enhanced stability in vivo of a mutant form of a protein that has an enhanced thermodynamic stability in vitro. although the ni protein concentration is higher than the normal level, reduced growth in lactate medium indicated that the specific activity of this iso cytochrome c in vivo is diminished relative to wild type. on the other hand, the level of the thermodynamically labile ng iso cytochrome c was below normal. the in vivo levels of the ni and ng iso cytochrome c suggest that proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space can be subjected to degradation, and that this degradation may play a role in controlling their normal levels.
