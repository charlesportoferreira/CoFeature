mutations in target dna elements of yeast hap modulate its transcriptional activity without affecting dna binding.. . the yeast zinc cluster protein hap, a member of the gal family, is a transcriptional activator that binds as a homodimer to target dna sequences. these targets include the upstream activating sequences of the cyc and cyc genes, which have no obvious sequence similarity. even though both sites have the same affinity for hap, activation differs at these two sites, even when the sequences are placed in an identical promoter context. in addition, mutants of hap that can bind to both sites but are specifically transcriptionally inactive at cyc have been previously isolated. in order to identify nucleotides that are responsible for this differential activity, we have performed random and site directed mutagenesis of these target sites and assayed their binding to hap in vitro and their activity in vivo in reporter plasmids. our results show that hap binding sites are degenerate forms of the direct repeat cgg n ta n cgg n ta. moreover, we show that activity of hap mutants defective for activation of the cycgene is restored by specific mutations in the cyc binding site. conversely, other mutations of the target sites prevent activation by hap, without interfering with dna binding. the results suggest that the sequence of the target sites influences the conformation and, hence, the activity of dna bound hap.
