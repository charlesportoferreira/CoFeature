structure, function, and temperature sensitivity of directed, random mutants at proline and glycine in omega loop d of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . residues form a tight turn within omega loop d in saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c. directed, random mutagenesis of invariant residues proline and glycine in this turn were analyzed for the in vivo functionality and level of protein within the cell. all proteins, except proval, also exhibit a significant decrease in intracellular cytochrome c levels, ranging from % to % of wild type. furthermore, all isolated mutant strains, except the one expressing proval, exhibit a significant decrease in growth on lactate medium, suggesting that the variant cytochromes are much less functional than wild type. this requirement for protein function is clearly the cause for the strict invariance of these residues in eukaryotic cytochromes c. seven proteins with mutations just at pro were purified and studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. all proteins with mutations at pro exhibit melting temperatures about degreesc less than that of the wild type protein, suggesting that mutation of pro affects the entropy of the denatured state. it is proposed that the functional significance of pro and gly is the requirement for a type ii (betagammal) beta turn in this loop, the conformation of which requires a glycine at the third position, and that a change occurs in this turn conformation upon a change in the redox state of the protein.
