degradation of cytochrome oxidase subunits in mutants of yeast lacking cytochrome c and suppression of the degradation by mutation of yme.. . we have confirmed by spectral analysis that cytochrome oxidase is not present in strains of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae having a primary deficiency in cytochrome c, and we have demonstrated by immunological procedures that such strains lack the mitochondrially encoded subunits i, ii, and iii of cytochrome oxidase. furthermore, pulse chase experiments demonstrated that subunit ii is rapidly degraded in vivo. this degradation can be at least partially suppressed by disruption of the nuclear gene yme, which encodes a putative atp zn(+) dependent protease. we suggest that the cytochrome oxidase subunits are not properly assembled in the absence of cytochrome c, and that yme and possibly other proteases degrade the unassembled mitochondrial encoded subunits of cytochrome oxidase.
