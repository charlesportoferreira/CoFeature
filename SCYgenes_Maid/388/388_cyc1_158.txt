separation of factors required for cleavage and polyadenylation of yeast pre mrna.. . cleavage and polyadenylation of yeast precursor rna require at least four functionally distinct factors (cleavage factor i [cf i], cf ii, polyadenylation factor i [pf i], and poly(a) polymerase [pap]) obtained from yeast whole cell extract. cleavage of precursor occurs upon combination of the cf i and cf ii fractions. the cleavage reaction proceeds in the absence of pap or pf i. the cleavage factors exhibit low but detectable activity without exogenous atp but are stimulated when this cofactor is included in the reaction. cleavage by cf i and cf ii is dependent on the presence of a (ua) sequence upstream of the gal poly(a) site. the factors will also efficiently cleave precursor with the cyc poly(a) site. this rna does not contain a ua repeat, and processing at this site is thought to be directed by a uag...uaugua type motif. specific polyadenylation of a precleaved gal rna requires cf i, pf i, and a crude fraction containing pap activity. the pap fraction can be replaced by recombinant pap, indicating that this enzyme is the only factor in this fraction needed for the reconstituted reaction. the poly(a) addition step is also dependent on the ua repeat. since cf i is the only factor necessary for both cleavage and poly(a) addition, it is likely that this fraction contains a component which recognizes processing signals located upstream of the poly(a) site. the initial separation of processing factors in yeast cells suggests both interesting differences from and similarities to the mammalian system.
