ubiquitin conjugation to cytochromes c. structure of the yeast iso conjugate and possible recognition determinants.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c was conjugated with ubiquitin (ub) in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte extract (fraction ii). by n terminal protein sequencing, it was found for both the mono and diubiquitinated products that the major ub attachment site is on lys (residue ) of the cytochrome c. thus, the residue ubiquitinated in iso cytochrome c is identical with that previously determined for the yeast iso form (sokolik, c. w., and cohen, r. e. () j. biol. chem. , ). for both cytochromes c, the proportions of diubiquitinated and higher order conjugates are drastically reduced when ub is replaced with a lys arg variant, suggesting that the ub ub moieties are linked predominantly through lys. despite close similarities in structure and ubiquitination sites, conjugation to iso cytochrome c is approximately fold faster than for the iso form; vertebrate cytochromes c are even poorer substrates, being ubiquitinated at only approximately % of the rate of the iso protein. comparison of several cytochrome c variants excludes alpha n acetylation or the identity of the n terminal amino acid as the important recognition determinants in these reactions. the results, which include the finding that ferro and ferri iso cytochromes c are ubiquitinated equally, also are evidence against a simple correlation between ubiquitination efficiency and thermodynamic stability. rather, the presence of a pair of lysines (lys lys) within the relatively unstructured n terminal extension of the yeast cytochromes c may be responsible for their preferential ubiquitination.
