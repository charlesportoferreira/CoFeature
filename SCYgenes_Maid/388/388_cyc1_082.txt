differential ubiquitin dependent degradation of the yeast apo cytochrome c isozymes.. . the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains two forms of cytochrome c, iso and iso cytochrome c, which are encoded by the nuclear genes cyc and cyc, respectively. the cytochromes c are synthesized in the cytosol, imported into mitochondria, and subsequently modified by the covalent attachment of heme through the action of cytochrome c heme lyase, which is encoded by cyc. apo iso cytochrome c but not apo iso cytochrome c was observed in cyc( ) mutants. furthermore, pulse chase experiments previously demonstrated that the lack of apo iso cytochrome c was due to its rapid degradation. we report herein that this degradation of apo iso cytochrome c is dependent on ubiquitination and on the action of the proteasome. diminished degradation of apo iso cytochrome c was observed in pre and pre mutants having altered proteasome subunits; in ubc, ubc, and ubc strains lacking one or more of the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes; and in strains blocked in multi ubiquitination by overproduction of the abnormal ubiquitin kr ubiquitin. in addition, we have used epitope tagged ubiquitin to demonstrate that apo iso cytochrome c but not apo iso cytochrome c is ubiquitinated. furthermore, the degradation of apo iso cytochrome c was diminished when the n terminal region was replaced with the n terminal region of apo iso cytochrome c, indicating that this region may be the target for degradation. we suggest that ubiquitin dependent degradation of apo iso cytochrome c is part of the regulatory process controlling the preferential expression of the iso cytochromes c.
