a point mutation in the cyc uas creates a new combination of regulatory elements that activate transcription synergistically.. . dissection of the upstream activation site (uas) of the yeast cyc gene showed that the a and b regions respond individually to regulation by the hap protein, and that a point mutation in the b region converts this region to a translation upstream factor (tuf) regulated element. combinatorial analyses revealed that the transacting factors involved with these wild type and mutant uas target sites combine to activate transcription in a synergistic manner. furthermore, combinations of heterologous factors, made possible by the point mutation, create a new specificity of regulation that differs from regulation by any one factor individually.
