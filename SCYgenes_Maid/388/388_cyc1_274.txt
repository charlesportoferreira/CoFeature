new mutations affecting induced mutagenesis in yeast.. . previously isolated mutations in baker's yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, that impair induced mutagenesis were all identified with the aid of tests that either exclusively or predominantly detect base pair substitutions. to avoid this bias, we have screened potentially mutant clones for uv induced reversion of the frameshift allele, his , and have identified mutants that give much reduced yields of revertants. complementation and recombination tests show that of these carry mutations at the previously known rev, rev and rev loci, while the remaining define new genes, rev ( mutations), rev and rev. the rev mutations are readily suppressed in many genetic backgrounds and, like the rev mutation, impart only a limited deficiency for induced mutagenesis. it is likely, therefore that the rev+ and rev+ gene functions are only remotely concerned with this process. the rev mutants have a more general deficiency, however, as well as marked sensitivity to uv and an increased spontaneous mutation rate, properties that suggest the rev gene is directly involved in mutation induction. the rev gene is located about cm proximal to cyc on chromosome x.
