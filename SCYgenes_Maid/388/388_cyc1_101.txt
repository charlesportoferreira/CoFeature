expression of a yeast gene can be blocked by insertion of short yeast dna fragments between a uas and the tata box.. . we have constructed a plasmid, pov, which facilitates the introduction of putative upstream activating sequences (uas) or upstream repressing sequences (urs) from yeast genes into plasmids containing cycl lacz fusions. we have observed that the insertion of yeast sequences from to bp between the uas and the tata box of a cycl lacz fusion gene can block beta galactosidase expression. it is suggested that this block is related to the formation of nucleosomes on the dna.
