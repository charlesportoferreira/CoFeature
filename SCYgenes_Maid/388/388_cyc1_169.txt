the rox gene encodes an essential nuclear protein involved in cyc gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the rox gene was identified during a hunt for mutants with increased expression of the heme regulated cyc gene, which encodes the minor species of cytochrome c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rox mutants caused a fold increase in cyc expression both in the presence and absence of heme, had slightly increased anaerobic expression of the heme activated cyc gene, and caused decreases in the anaerobic expression of the heme repressed anb gene and the aerobic expression of its heme induced homolog. the wild type rox gene was cloned, and the sequence indicated that it encodes a amino acid protein. this protein is essential; deletion of the coding sequence was lethal. the coding sequence for beta galactosidase was fused to the ' end of the rox coding sequence, and the fusion product was found to be localized in the nucleus, strongly suggesting that the wild type protein carries out a nuclear function. mutations in the rox gene showed an interesting pattern of intragenic complementation. a deletion of the ' coding region complemented a nonsense mutation at codon but could not prevent the lethality of the null mutation. these results suggest that the amino terminal domain is required for an essential function, while the carboxy terminal domain can be supplied in trans to achieve the wild type expression of cyc. finally, rna blots demonstrated that the rox mrna was expressed at higher levels anaerobically but was not subject to heme repression. the nuclear localization and the lack of viability of null mutants suggest that the rox protein is a general regulatory factor.
