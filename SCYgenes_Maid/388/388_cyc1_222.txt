rox encodes a heme induced repression factor regulating anb and cyc of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the rox gene encodes a product implicated in the regulation of heme repressed and heme induced genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the gene has been cloned and shown to code for a . kilobase transcript. the cloned gene was used to construct a null mutant to determine the role of rox in regulating the expression of several heme regulated genes. constitutive expression of anb (a heme repressed gene) was observed in the null strain, indicating that rox codes for a repressor or a facilitator of repression. enhancement of expression of cyc in the null strain indicated that the rox factor is required for repression of cyc to its normal low level of expression, consistent with evidence that cyc has a hybrid heme induced, heme repressed regulatory mechanism. the null mutation had only a slight negative effect on expression of the heme induced genes cyc and tr (a heme induced homolog of anb), suggesting that the rox factor is not directly involved in their regulation despite the existence of an unusual rox mutation (rox a) causing constitutive expression of this group. the respiratory competence of the null mutant indicates that rox is not a respiratory factor. rox expression was found to be induced by heme, indicating that the heme repression of anb and its family is the result of a cascade in which heme induces a repression factor which keeps the family of heme repressed genes inactive during aerobic growth. the rox a allele had earlier been shown to cause constitutive expression of the family of heme induced respiratory genes. this allele was found to cause constitutive expression of the rox transcript itself, indicating that rox is in the major heme induced regulon.
