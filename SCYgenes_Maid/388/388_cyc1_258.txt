evolution of cytochrome c genes and pseudogenes.. . a statistical analysis of the nucleotide sequences of cytochrome c genes from four species of animals and two of yeast and of cytochrome c pseudogenes from rat, mouse, and human was conducted. it was estimated that animals and yeast diverged . billion years ago, that the two duplicated genes dc and dc in drosophila diverged million years ago, and that the two duplicated genes iso and iso in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae diverged million years ago. dc is expressed at a low level and has evolved times faster than dc. this observation supports the neutralist view that relaxation of functional constraints is a more likely cause of accelerated evolution following gene duplication than is advantageous mutation. all the rodent pseudogenes examined appear to be processed pseudogenes derived directly from the functional genes, and most of them apparently arose after the mouse rat split. no event of gene conversion could be detected between any pair of the rodent pseudogenes. our analysis suggests that the human cytochrome c gene has evolved at a rate comparable to the average rate for pseudogenes, whereas some human cytochrome c pseudogenes have evolved at an exceptionally low rate.
