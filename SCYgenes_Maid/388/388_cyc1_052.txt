dna unwinding in the cyc and ded yeast promoters.. . the capacity of promoter dna of two yeast genes to be unwound was studied. both promoters, those of the cyc and ded genes, contain long oligopurine.oligopyrimidine (r.y) tracts. the two promoters were cloned into negatively supercoiled plasmids, and their sensitivity to single strand specific nuclease p was examined. extensive p cleavage was located within the r.y tracts, and cleavage sites were mapped. the extent of cleavage was only slightly dependent on p concentration, indicating a slow conversion of an intermediate form of dna into the p reactive state. the cleavage required negative supercoiling and was suppressed by nacl, mgcl and spermine. two dimensional topoisomer analysis showed that six superhelical turns were opened in the plasmids examined. the results indicate that at sufficient torsional stress, the r.y tracts can intermittently undergo a transition into an unwound, ready to separate state. the oligopurine.oligopyrimidine tracts may thus serve as dna unwinding centers in the gene promoters where they reside.
