characterization of an alkaline transition intermediate stabilized in the phetrp variant of yeast iso cytochrome c.. . in general, mutation of the phylogenetically conserved residue phe in yeast iso cytochrome c destabilizes the native conformation of the protein by facilitating the ligand exchange reactions that are associated with the alkaline conformational transitions of the ferricytochrome. of the phe variants surveyed thus far, phetrp is unique in that it adopts a thermodynamically stable, high spin conformation at mildly alkaline ph. this species exhibits spectroscopic features that can only be detected transiently in other ferricytochromes c within the first ms immediately after a ph jump from neutrality to ph &gt;. spectroscopic characterization of this high spin reaction intermediate suggests that in addition to an obligatory pentacoordinate heme iron, a group within the heme pocket coordinates the heme iron but is then replaced either by met, to revert to the native conformation, or by lys or lys, to yield one of the conventional alkaline conformers. evidence is presented to suggest that this group is either a hydroxide ion or tyr rather than a loosely bound met.
