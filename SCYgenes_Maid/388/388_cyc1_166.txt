initiation on chromatin templates in a yeast rna polymerase ii transcription system.. . templates were prepared with either the tata box or transcription start sites of the yeast cyc promoter in a nucleosome. in both cases, initiation in an unfractionated yeast rna polymerase ii transcription system was abolished by the nucleosome. the inhibition appeared to be relieved by the activator protein gal vp binding to a site upstream of the promoter. inhibition was not relieved, however, in a transcription system reconstituted from purified components, indicating a requirement for additional factors for the effect of gal vp.
