spn, a conserved gene identified by suppression of a postrecruitment defective yeast tata binding protein mutant.. . little is known about tata binding protein (tbp) functions after recruitment to the tata element, although several tbp mutants display postrecruitment defects. here we describe a genetic screen for suppressors of a postrecruitment defective tbp allele. suppression was achieved by a single point mutation in a previously uncharacterized saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, spn (suppresses postrecruitment functions gene number ). spn is an essential yeast gene that is highly conserved throughout evolution. the suppressing mutation in spn substitutes an asparagine for an invariant lysine at position (spn(kn)). the spn(kn) strain is able to suppress additional alleles of tbp that possess postrecruitment defects, but not a tbp allele that is postrecruitment competent. in addition, spnp does not stably associate with tfiid in vivo. cells containing the spn(kn) allele exhibit a temperature sensitive phenotype and some defects in activated transcription, whereas constitutive transcription appears relatively robust in the mutant background. consistent with an important role in postrecruitment functions, transcription from the cyc promoter, which has been shown to be regulated by postrecruitment mechanisms, is enhanced in spn(kn) cells. moreover, we find that spn is a member of the spt gene family, further supporting a functional requirement for the spn gene product in transcriptional processes.
