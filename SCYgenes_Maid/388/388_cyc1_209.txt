transcription terminates near the poly(a) site in the cyc gene of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a base pair region required for normal cyc mrna ' end formation in saccharomyces cerevisiae was shown to be necessary for the termination of transcription in vivo by examining the stability of cen plasmids. cen plasmids were stably maintained during vegetative growth, unless a gal transcript impinged on the cen region. transcription from the gal promoter was terminated, and plasmid stability was restored by the insertion of a fragment containing the base pair region of cyc. in contrast, a similar fragment lacking the base pair region had no such stabilizing effect. furthermore, cyc mrna transcription terminated in a region less than nucleotides downstream from the normal poly(a) site, thus establishing that cyc mrna ' end formation does not involve overly extended precursors as are observed in higher eukaryotes.
