structural changes in cytochrome c upon hydrogen deuterium exchange.. . the resonance raman spectra of yeast ferri and ferro iso cytochrome c dissolved in ho and do are reported. hydrogen exchange in the protein leads to distinct spectral changes of heme vibrational bands, particularly in the region between and cm and at approximately and approximately cm . the latter two bands, which have previously been assigned to porphyrin modes including bending vibrations of the propionate side chains [hildebrandt, p. () j. mol. struct. , ], reveal frequency shifts by up to cm . these shifts are attributed to structural changes of the propionate groups caused by the energetic differences of the hydrogen and deuterium bonds between these substituents and the adjacent amino acid residues. the frequency shifts of the bands between and cm most likely reflect structural differences of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle itself. time dependent experiments revealed that the hydrogen exchange processes associated with the changes in the resonance raman spectra are complete in less than min. the protons which are involved are those in the interior of the heme pocket as concluded by comparison with the exchange rate constants previously determined by nmr spectroscopy [mayne, l., paterson, y., cerasoli, d., &amp; englander, s. w. () biochemistry , ]. these protons are part of a hydrogen bonding network including the amide protons of asn , met , and lys , the side chain protons of asn , tyr , thr , trp , and thr , and the water molecules and .(abstract truncated at words)
