pcf encodes a third protein component of yeast cleavage and polyadenylation factor i.. . cleavage and polyadenylation factor i (cf i) is one of four factors required in vitro for yeast pre mrna ' end processing. two protein components of this factor, encoded by genes rna and rna, have already been identified. we describe here another gene, pcf (for protein of cf i), that genetically interacts with rna and rna and which presumably codes for a third protein component of cf i. this gene was isolated in a two hybrid screening designed to identify proteins interacting with rna and rna. pcf is an essential gene encoding for a protein of amino acids having an apparent molecular mass of kda. thermosensitive mutations in pcf are synergistically lethal with thermosensitive alleles of rna and rna. the pcf thermosensitive strain shows a shortening of the poly(a) tails and a strong decrease in the steady state level of actin transcripts after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature as do the thermosensitive alleles of rna and rna. extracts from the pcf and pcf thermosensitive strains and the wild type strain, when pcf is neutralized by specific antibodies, are deficient in cleavage and polyadenylation. moreover, fractions obtained by anion exchange chromatography of extracts from the wild type strain contain both pcf and rna in the same fractions, as shown by immunoblotting with a pcf specific antibody.
