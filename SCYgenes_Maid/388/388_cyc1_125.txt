the relationship between the trimethylation of lysine and cytochrome c metabolism in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . . site directed mutations were constructed in the yeast iso cytochrome c gene adjacent to the lysine (methylation site) codon. . these mutant genes were then cloned and transformed into the s. cerevisiae strain b which contains a deficiency in the iso cytochrome c gene. . the resulting transformants were screened for cytochrome c production using gel electrophoresis. . amino acid analysis of the mutated cytochromes c demonstrated varying levels of trimethyllysine formation, depending on the nature of the site directed mutation. . the resulting transformants were then used as tools in order to investigate the relationship between trimethyllysine formation and various aspects of cytochrome c metabolism including protein stability and heme conjugation.
