tsf to tsf, required for silencing the saccharomyces cerevisiae gal genes, are global regulatory genes.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae gal and gal genes are controlled in response to the availability of galactose and glucose by multiple activating and repressing proteins bound at adjacent or overlapping sites in uasg. negative control elements in uasg, designated gal operators galo to galo, are required to silence basal level transcription of gal and gal when galactose is absent. we isolated and characterized recessive mutations in six nuclear genes, tsf to tsf, that impair silencing of gal and gal gene expression. surprisingly, the results of several experiments suggest that the tsf genes encode global regulatory factors. tsf to tsf mutations derepressed expression from yeast cyc gal hybrid promoters (fused to lacz) that harbor a variety of operator sequences, and caused pleiotropic defects in cell growth, mating, and sporulation. s mapping and northern blot results for tsf suggest that the molecular defect is at the transcriptional level. mutant phenotypes were additive in certain combinations of tsf double mutants, implying that more than one silencing pathway is involved in tsf to tsf function. most significantly, mutations in all six tsf to tsf genes activated expression from gal and cyc promoters (fused to lacz) lacking upstream activating sequences. combined, the simplest interpretation of these results is that tsf to tsf encode factors that control the function of the basic rna polymerase ii transcriptional machinery.
