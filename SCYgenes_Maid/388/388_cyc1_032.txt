a cytochrome c gfp fusion is not released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm upon expression of bax in yeast cells.. . to study bax induced release of cytochrome c in vivo, we have expressed a cytochrome c gfp (green fluorescent protein) fusion in saccharomyces cerevisiae cells null for the expression of the endogenous cytochrome. we show here that cytochrome c gfp is efficiently localised to mitochondria and able to function as an electron carrier between complexes iii and iv of the respiratory chain. strikingly, while natural cytochrome c is released into the cytoplasm upon expression of bax, the cytochrome c gfp fusion is not. nevertheless, cells co expressing bax and the cytochrome c gfp fusion die, indicating that mitochondrial release of cytochrome c is not essential for cell death to occur in yeast. the failure to release cytochrome c gfp is presumed to arise from increased bulk due to the gfp moiety. we propose that in intact yeast cells, bax induced release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm occurs through a selective pore and not as a consequence of the non specific breakage of the mitochondrial outer membrane.
