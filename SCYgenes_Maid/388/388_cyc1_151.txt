evidence for an interaction between the cyp(hap) activator and a cellular factor during heme dependent transcriptional regulation in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . previously, it was shown that the cyp(hap) gene product mediates the transcription of several oxygen regulated genes through a metabolic co effector, heme, in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. this study investigates the overproduction of the cyp protein when the cyp(hap) gene is placed under the control of the gal cyc hybrid promoter (either at the locus of the cyp(hap) gene or cloned in a high copy number plasmid). in these conditions, the cyp protein is detected by western blot analysis and has a molecular mass in agreement with the open reading frame sequence. band shift experiments show that the cyp(hap) protein is able to interact specifically with its target sequences in vitro without addition of hemin, and forms a large complex with one or several unidentified factors denoted as x. addition of hemin allows the formation of a new complex which has a lower molecular mass. the internal deletion of the seven repeated amino acid sequences containing the kcpvdh motif in the cyp(hap) protein modifies the heme responsiveness phenomenon observed in vitro in the band shift experiments and in vivo in the transcription of the cyb, cyc, cyp(cyc) and erg genes. on the basis of these data, we propose a new model for heme induced activation of the cyp protein.
