regulation of interprotein electron transfer by trp of cytochrome c peroxidase.. . cytochrome c peroxidase (ccp) reacts with peroxide to form compound i, an intermediate that has an oxy ferryl iron center and a stable indolyl radical at trp . during the normal catalytic cycle, the oxy ferryl heme and the trp radical are reduced by sequential electron transfers from ferrous cytochrome c (cc). to investigate the role of protein structure in these electron transfer reactions, mutagenesis was used to replace trp with phe. the trp &gt;phe enzyme [ccp(mi,f)] reacts with peroxide to form an oxy ferryl iron center and a transient porphyrin radical. the reaction of cc from horse and yeast with peroxide oxidized ccp(mi,f) was characterized under transient and steady state conditions. the rate of et from cc to the oxy ferryl heme of ccp(mi,f) was decreased by at least , fold relative to the ccp(mi) parent. this effect was observed at and mm ionic strength, with both yeast and horse cytochrome c as the substrate. thus, trp is a critical component of all pathways that permit rapid reduction of the oxy ferryl heme by cc under these conditions. the reaction of the porphyrin radical with cc was difficult to characterize, owing to the short half life of this intermediate. the oxidation of cc by this intermediate had a maximum rate constant of s at ph ., degrees c. circumstantial evidence suggests that the porphyrin radical is not directly reduced by cc, but is instead reduced via a protein based radical intermediate. the steady state activity of the mutant enzyme was fold lower than the ccp(mi) parent, but kcat is times greater than the rate constant for reduction of the oxy ferryl heme under all conditions examined. thus, the oxy ferryl heme is not reduced to the ferric state under steady state conditions. transient changes in the absorption spectrum further indicate that steady state oxidation of cc+ by ccp(mi,f) occurs via reaction of peroxide with the oxy ferryl enzyme.
