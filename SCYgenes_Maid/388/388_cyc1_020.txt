interactions between yeast iso cytochrome c and its peroxidase.. . isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the formation of complexes involving yeast iso ferricytochrome c (cc) and ferricytochrome c peroxidase (ccp). the complexes comprised combinations of the wild type proteins, six ccp variants, and three cc variants. sixteen protein combinations were designed to probe the crystallographically defined interface between cc and ccp. the data show that the high affinity sites on cc and ccp coincide with the crystallographically defined sites. changing charged residues to alanine increases the enthalpy of complex formation by a constant amount, but the decrease in stability depends on the location of the amino acid substitution. deleting methyl groups has a small effect on the binding enthalpy and a larger deleterious effect on the binding free energy, consistent with model studies of the hydrophobic effect, and showing that nonpolar interactions also stabilize the complex. double mutant cycles were used to determine the coupling energies for nine cc ccp residue pairs. comparing these energies to the crystal structure of the complex leads to the conclusion that many of the substitutions induce a rearrangement of the complex.
