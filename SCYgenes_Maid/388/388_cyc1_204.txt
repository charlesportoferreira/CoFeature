assignment of proton resonances, identification of secondary structural elements, and analysis of backbone chemical shifts for the ct variant of yeast iso cytochrome c and horse cytochrome c.. . resonance assignments for the main chain, side chain, exchangeable side chain, and heme protons of the ct variant of saccharomyces cerevisiae iso cytochrome c in both oxidation states (with the exception of gly ) are reported. (we have also independently assigned horse cytochrome c.) some additional assignments for the horse protein extend those of wand and co workers [wand, a. j., di stefano, d. l., feng, y., roder, h., &amp; englander, s. w. () biochemistry , ; feng, y., roder, h., englander, s. w., wand, a. j., &amp; di stefano, d. l. () biochemistry , ]. qualitative interpretation of nuclear overhauser enhancement data allows the secondary structure of these two proteins to be described relative to crystal structures. comparison of the chemical shift of the backbone protons of the ct variant and horse protein reveals significant differences resulting from amino acid substitution at positions and and further substitutions between residue and residue . although the overall folding of yeast iso cytochrome c and horse cytochrome c is very similar, there can be large differences in chemical shift for structurally equivalent residues. chemical shift differences of amide protons (and to a lesser extent alpha protons) represent minute changes in hydrogen bonding. therefore, great care must be taken in the use of differences in chemical shift as evidence for structural changes even between highly homologous proteins.
