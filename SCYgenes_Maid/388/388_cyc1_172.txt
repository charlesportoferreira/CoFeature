analysis of the invariant phe residue of yeast iso cytochrome c by site directed mutagenesis using a phagemid yeast shuttle vector.. . a phagemid (ping) carrying the yeast iso cytochrome c gene was constructed which bears all the elements necessary for replication in yeast and bacteria and may be converted into a single stranded form of dna for site directed mutagenesis and nucleotide sequencing. the recombinant vector was used to create a complete set of amino acid changes at position , a phylogenetically conserved phenylalanine residue in mitochondrial cytochrome c. all the different forms of cytochrome c were functional in vivo, based upon their ability to support respiration when the mutant proteins were expressed in a yeast strain (otherwise devoid of cytochrome c) grown on non fermentable carbon sources, with only the strain containing the cys variant having a substantially decreased growth rate. these results are interpreted in terms of the available structural and functional information previously reported on a subset of cytochrome c proteins with mutations at position .
