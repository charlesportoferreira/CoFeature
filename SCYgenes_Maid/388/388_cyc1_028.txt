the role of nuclear cap binding protein cbcp of yeast in mrna termination and degradation.. . the cyc mutation in saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a % reduction in the level of iso cytochrome c because of the lack of a proper ' end forming signal, resulting in low levels of eight aberrantly long cyc mrnas which differ in length at their ' termini. cyc can be suppressed by deletion of either of the nonessential genes cbc and cbc, which encode the cbp and cbp subunits of the nuclear cap binding complex, respectively, or by deletion of the nonessential gene upf, which encodes a major component of the mrna surveillance complex. the upf delta deletion suppressed the cyc defect by diminishing degradation of the longer subset of cyc mrnas, suggesting that downstream elements or structures occurred in the extended ' region, similar to the downstream elements exposed by transcripts bearing premature nonsense mutations. on the other hand, suppression of cyc defects by cbc delta occurred by two different mechanisms. the levels of the shorter cyc transcripts were enhanced in the cbc delta mutants by promoting ' end formation at otherwise weak sites, whereas the levels of the longer cyc transcripts, as well as of all mrnas, were slightly enhanced by diminishing degradation. furthermore, cbc delta greatly suppressed the degradation of mrnas and other phenotypes of a rat strain which is defective in mrna export. we suggest that cbcp defines a novel degradation pathway that acts on mrnas partially retained in nuclei.
