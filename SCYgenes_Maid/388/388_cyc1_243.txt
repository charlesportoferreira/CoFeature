a highly revertible cyc mutant of yeast contains a small tandem duplication.. . a mutant, cyc , that reverts spontaneously at an extremely high rate, was uncovered after examining approximately cyc mutants which lack or have defective iso cytochrome c in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. cloning and dna sequencing of appropriate fragments revealed that the cyc mutation contained a bp duplication whereas the spontaneously arising revertants contained the normal wild type sequence. because the bp segment in the wild type sequence is flanked by a bp repeat and because the cyc mutation arose spontaneously, the bp duplication may have arisen by slippage and misalignment during dna synthesis. the high reversion rate was not diminished in strains containing the rad mutation, which generally reduces mitotic recombination, including recombination associated with the elimination of a segment of a long direct repeat. thus the loss of segments from short and long duplications occur by different mechanisms. we suggest that the high reversion rates of cyc and other short duplications are due to misalignment errors during replication.
