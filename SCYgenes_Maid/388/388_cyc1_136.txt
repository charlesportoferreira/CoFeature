redesign of the interior hydrophilic region of mitochondrial cytochrome c by site directed mutagenesis.. . heme propionate in cytochrome c is an ionizable group located in a region of the protein that is inaccessible to bulk solvent. electrostatic stabilization of this functional group appears to be achieved through interaction of heme propionate with several amino acid residues that occur within hydrogen bonding distance of it. to investigate the functional and spectroscopic roles of the amino acid residues that contribute to the immediate environment of heme propionate , the following variant forms of yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) cytochrome c have been prepared and characterized by electrochemical and spectrochemical analyses. argala, tyrphe, alaphe, tyrphe/trpphe, and argala/tyrphe/trpphe. for each protein, the dependence of midpoint reduction potential and nmr spectrum on ph was determined, and the uv ( nm) circular dichroic (cd) spectrum was measured. all of the variant proteins exhibited decreased reduction potentials with the greatest difference ( to mv) exhibited by the multiply mutated proteins. the electrostatic properties of the variant proteins as reflected by the oxidation state dependence of the his pka value were similar to those of the wild type protein. previous indirect assignments of minima in the cd spectrum of cytochrome c at and nm to trp are confirmed by spectra of the variant cytochromes in which this residue is replaced by phe. the present results establish that the electrochemical effects of eliminating hydrogen bonding interactions with heme propionate are not additive and that the functional modulation of cytochrome c through regulation of the heme propionate dielectric environment involves a complex combination of solvation effects and electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions.
