initiation of translation can occur only in a restricted region of the cyc mrna of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the steady state levels and half lives of cyc mrnas were estimated in a series of mutant strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae containing (i) taa nonsense codons, (ii) atg initiator codons, or (iii) the sequence ata atg act taa (denoted atg taa) at various positions along the cyc gene, which encodes iso cytochrome c. these mutational alterations were made in backgrounds lacking all internal in frame and out of frame atg triplets or containing only one atg initiator codon at the normal position. the results revealed a &quot;sensitive&quot; region encompassing approximately the first half of the cyc mrna, in which nonsense codons caused upf dependent degradation. this result and the stability of cyc mrnas lacking all atg triplets, as well as other results, suggested that degradation occurs unless elements associated with this sensitive region are covered with s ribosomes, s ribosomal subunits, or ribonucleoprotein particle proteins. while elongation by s ribosomes could be prematurely terminated by taa codons, the scanning of s ribosomal units could not be terminated solely by taa codons but could be disrupted by the atg taa sequence, which caused the formation and subsequent prompt release of s ribosomes. the atg taa sequence caused degradation of the cyc mrna only when it was in the region spanning nucleotide positions to + but not in the remaining ' distal region, suggesting that translation could initiate only in this restricted initiation region. cyc mrna distribution on polyribosomes confirmed that only atg codons within the initiation region were translated at high efficiency. this initiation region was not entirely dependent on the distance from the ' cap site and was not obviously dependent on the short range secondary structure but may simply reflect an open structural requirement for initiation of translation of the cyc mrna.
