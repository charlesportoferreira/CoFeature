probing iso cytochrome c structure by site directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques.. . a cysteine specific methanethiosulfonate spin label was introduced into yeast iso cytochrome c at three different positions. the modified forms of cytochrome c included. the wild type protein labeled at naturally occurring c, and two mutated proteins, sc and lc, labeled at positions and , respectively (both sc and lc derived from the protein in which c had been replaced by threonine). all three spin labeled protein derivatives were characterized using electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) techniques. the continuous wave (cw) epr spectrum of spin label attached to lc differed from those recorded for spin label attached to c or sc, indicating that spin label at position was more immobilized and exhibited more complex tumbling than spin label at two other positions. the temperature dependence of the cw epr spectra and cw epr power saturation revealed further differences of spin labeled lc. the results were discussed in terms of application of the site directed spin labeling technique in probing the local dynamic structure of iso cytochrome c.
