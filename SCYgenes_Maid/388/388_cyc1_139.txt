structurally engineered cytochromes with unusual ligand binding properties. expression of saccharomyces cerevisiae met &gt;ala iso cytochrome c.. . a strategy has been developed to express and purify a recombinant, nonfunctional axial ligand mutant of iso cytochrome c (met &gt;ala) in saccharomyces cerevisiae in quantities necessary for extensive biophysical characterization. it involves coexpressing in the same plasmid (yep) the nonfunctional gene with a functional gene copy for complementation in a selective medium. the functional gene encodes a product with an engineered metal chelating dihistidine site (his and leu &gt;his) that enables efficient separation of the two isoforms by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. the purified met &gt;ala protein possesses a binding site for dioxygen and other exogenous ligands. absorption spectra of several derivatives of this mutant show striking similarities to those of corresponding derivatives of horseradish peroxidase, myoglobin, and cytochrome p. the use of a dual gene vector for cytochrome c expression together with metal affinity separation opens the way for the engineering of variants with dramatically altered structural and catalytic properties.
