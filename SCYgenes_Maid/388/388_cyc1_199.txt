the hap subunit of yeast ccaat transcriptional activator contains adjacent domains for subunit association and dna recognition. model for the hap// complex.. . budding yeast hap is required in concert with hap and hap to form a heterotrimeric ccaat binding transcriptional activation complex at the uas element of cyc. functional homologs of hap and hap have been conserved in hela cells where hap activity corresponds to a chromatographic fraction designated cpb. here, we describe deletion and codon insertion mutagenesis of the saccharomyces cerevisiae hap subunit. dna binding was assessed both in vitro and in vivo whereas subunit association and transcriptional activation were analyzed in vivo by using a bifunctional lexa hap fusion. the results indicate that the amino acid hap protein contains an &quot;essential core&quot; of amino acids, which is entirely sufficient for assembly and dna binding of the hap// complex. the essential core can be divided further into a region of amino acids, which is sufficient for subunit association, and a region of amino acids, which is required specifically for dna recognition. the remainder of the hap protein is dispensable. the roles of hap and hap in the heterotrimeric complex are also assessed by using lexa fusions and a fusion of the gal acidic activation domain to hap, which partially bypasses a deletion of hap but not hap. these data indicate that subunits hap and hap are primarily responsible for site specific dna binding by the complex, whereas the hap subunit provides the primary transcriptional activation domain. a model for the function of this regulated transcriptional activation complex is presented.
