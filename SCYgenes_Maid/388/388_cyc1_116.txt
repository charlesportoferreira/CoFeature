diminished degradation of yeast cytochrome c by interactions with its physiological partners.. . the level and structure of yeast iso cytochrome c and iso cytochrome c, encoded by the nuclear genes cyc and cyc, respectively, are normally not altered in rho mutants, which completely lack the cytochromes a.a subunits and cytochrome b that are encoded by mitochondrial dna. in contrast, iso cytochromes c containing the amino acid change thr &gt;ile (ti) were observed at the normal or near normal wild type level in rho+ strains but were completely absent in rho mutants. we have demonstrated with the &quot;global&quot; suppressor mutation asn &gt;ile and by pulse chase labeling that the ti iso cytochrome c undergoes rapid cellular degradation in rho mutants. furthermore, specific mutations revealed that the deficiency of ti iso cytochrome c can be caused by the lack of cytochrome a.a or cytochrome c, but not by the lack of cytochrome b. thus, this and certain other, but not all, labile forms of cytochrome c are protected from degradation by the interaction with its physiological partners.
