molecular characterization of mrg of saccharomyces cerevisiae. implication in the regulation of galactose and nonfermentable carbon source utilization.. . we have reported previously that multiple copies of mrg suppress gal genes in a wild type but not in a gal strain of saccharomyces cerevisiae. in this report we show that disruption of mrg leads to a decrease in gal induction when s. cerevisiae is induced with .% but not with .% galactose. disruption of mrg in a gal background (this strain shows long term adaptation phenotype) further delays the gal induction, supporting the notion that its function is important only under low inducing signals. as a corollary, disruption of mrg in a gal strain did not decrease the constitutive expression of gal genes. these results suggest that mrg has a role in gal regulation only when the induction signal is weak. unlike the effect on gal gene expression, disruption of mrg leads to de repression of cyc driven beta galactosidase activity. mrg disruptant also showed a twofold increase in the rate of oxygen uptake as compared with the wild type strain. adh, cta, dld, and cyc promoters that are active during nonfermentative growth did not show any de repression of beta galactosidase activity in the mrg disruptant. western blot analysis indicated that mrg is a glucose repressible gene and is expressed in galactose and glycerol plus lactate. experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs indicate that mrgp is localized in the nucleus consistent with the presence of a consensus nuclear localization signal sequence. based on the above results, we propose that mrgp is a regulator of galactose and nonfermentable carbon utilization.
