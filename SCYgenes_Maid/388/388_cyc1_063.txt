the magnitude of changes in guanidine hcl unfolding m values in the protein, iso cytochrome c, depends upon the substructure containing the mutation.. . hydrophilic to hydrophobic mutations have been made at solvent exposed sites on the surface of iso cytochrome c. most of these mutations involve the replacement of lysine with methionine, which is nearly isosteric with lysine. minimal perturbation to the native structure is expected, and this expectation is confirmed by infrared amide i spectroscopy. guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies demonstrate that these variants affect the magnitude of the m value, the rate of change of free energy with respect to denaturant concentration, to different degrees. changes in m values are indicative of changes in the equilibrium folding mechanism of a protein. decreases in m values are normally thought to result either from an increased population of intermediates during unfolding or from a more compact denatured state. when cytochrome c is considered in terms of its thermodynamic substructures, the changes in the m value for a given variant appear to depend upon the substructure in which the mutation is made. these data indicate that the relative stabilities and physical properties of substructures of cytochrome c play an important determining role in the equilibrium folding mechanism of this protein.
