a unique pathway of double strand break repair operates in tandemly repeated genes.. . the rad gene product of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for most spontaneous recombination and almost all double strand break (dsb) repair. in contrast to recombination elsewhere in the genome, recombination in the ribosomal dna (rdna) array is rad independent. to determine the fate of a dsb in the rdna gene array, a cut site for the ho endonuclease was inserted into the rdna in a strain containing an inducible ho gene. dsbs were efficiently repaired at this site, even in the absence of the rad gene product. efficient rad independent dsb repair was also observed at another tandem gene array, cup, consisting of repeat units. however, in a smaller cup array, consisting of only three units, most dsbs (ca. %) were not repaired and resulted in cell death. all rad independent dsb repair events examined resulted in the loss of one or more repeat units. we propose a model for dsb repair in repeated sequences involving the generation of single stranded tails followed by reannealing.
