chromosome break induced dna replication leads to nonreciprocal translocations and telomere capture.. . in yeast, broken chromosomes can be repaired by recombination, resulting in nonreciprocal translocations. in haploid cells suffering an ho endonuclease induced, double strand break (dsb), nearly % of the broken chromosome ends recombined with a sequence near the opposite chromosome end, which shares only bp of homology with the cut sequence. this produced a repaired chromosome with the same kb sequence at each end. diploid strains were constructed in which the broken chromosome shared homology with the unbroken chromosome only on the centromere proximal side of the dsb. more than half of these cells repaired the dsb by copying sequences distal to the break from the unbroken template chromosome. all these events were rad dependent. pedigree analysis established that dsbs occurring in g were repaired by a replicative mechanism, producing two identical daughter cells. we discuss the implications of these data in understanding telomerase independent replication of telomeres, gene amplification, and the evolution of chromosomal ends.
