double strand breaks stimulate alternative mechanisms of recombination repair.. . to test the double strand break repair model, we used ho nuclease to introduce double strand breaks at several sites along a yeast chromosome containing duplicated dna. depending on the configuration of the double strand break and recombining markers, different spectra of recombinant products were observed. different repair kinetics and recombinant products were observed when a double strand break was introduced in unique or duplicated dna. the results of this study suggest that double strand breaks in yeast stimulate recombination by several mechanisms, and we propose an alternative mechanism for double strand break induced gene conversion that does not depend on direct participation of the broken ends.
