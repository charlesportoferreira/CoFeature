recombination initiated by double strand breaks.. . the ho endonuclease was used to introduce a site specific double strand break (dsb) in an interval designed to monitor mitotic recombination. the interval included the trp and his genes inserted into chromosome iii of s. cerevisiae between the cry and mat loci. mitotic recombination was monitored in a diploid carrying heteroalleles of trp and his. the normal recognition sites for the ho endonuclease were mutated at the mat alleles and a synthetic recognition site for ho endonuclease was placed between trp and his on one of the chromosomes. ho induced cleavage resulted in efficient recombination in this interval. most of the data can be explained by double strand gap repair in which the cut chromosome acts as the recipient. however, analysis of some of the recombinants indicates that regions of heteroduplex were generated flanking the site of the cut, and that some recombinants were the result of the cut chromosome acting as the genetic donor.
