the saccharomyces cerevisiae recombination enhancer biases recombination during interchromosomal mating type switching but not in interchromosomal homologous recombination.. . haploid saccharomyces can change mating type through ho endonuclease cleavage of an expressor locus, mat, followed by gene conversion using one of two repository loci, hml or hmr, as donor. the mating type of a cell dictates which repository locus is used as donor, with a cells using hml and alpha cells using hmr. this preference is established in part by re, a locus on the left arm of chromosome iii that activates the surrounding region, including hml, for recombination in a cells, an activity suppressed by alpha protein in alpha cells. we have examined the ability of re to stimulate different forms of interchromosomal recombination. we found that re exerted an effect on interchromosomal mating type switching and on intrachromosomal homologous recombination but not on interchromosomal homologous recombination. also, even in the absence of re, mat alpha still influenced donor preference in interchromosomal mating type switching, supporting a role of alpha in donor preference independent of re. these results suggest a model in which re affects competition between productive and nonproductive recombination outcomes. in interchromosome gene conversion, re enhances both productive and nonproductive pathways, whereas in intrachromosomal gene conversion and mating type switching, re enhances only the productive pathway.
