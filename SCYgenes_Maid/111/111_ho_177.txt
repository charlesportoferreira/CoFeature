regulation of yeast mating type interconversion. feedback control of ho gene expression by the mating type locus.. . the ultimate product of yeast mating type interconversion is a stable a/alpha diploid cell. a haploid cell carrying the ho gene gives rise to a diploid cell in a two step process. first, the cell switches mating type as a result of genetic rearrangement (cassette substitution) catalyzed by ho; then, cells of opposite type mate to form a/alpha diploids. mating type interconversion does not occur in a/alpha diploids despite the presence of the ho gene. we have identified a plasmid carrying the ho gene by screening a yeast clone bank (constructed in vector yep) for plasmids that allow mating type switching by ho cells. the yeast segment responsible for mating type interconversion integrates by homology at the ho locus, thus confirming that it carries ho. using the ho gene as a probe, we find that strains with an active mating type interconversion system produce ho rna, whereas a/alpha ho/ho cells do not and that this inhibition requires products of both the mata and mata genes. thus, mating type interconversion does not occur in a/alpha ho/ho cells because the ho gene product is not synthesized. these results demonstrate the following. (i) the mating type locus, proposed on genetic grounds to be a regulatory locus, controls expression of an unlinked gene (ho) at the level of rna production. (ii) the ho gene is under negative feedback control. its expression is inhibited after successful completion of diploidization (formation of a/alpha diploids).
