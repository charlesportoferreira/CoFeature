conversion of homothallic yeast to heterothallism through ho gene disruption.. . a simple method was developed for the conversion of homothallic saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains to heterothallism through ho gene disruption. an integrative ho.neo disrupted allele was constructed by cloning a dominant selectable marker, the bacterial neo gene, within the ho gene. transformation of a homothallic diploid s. cerevisiae strain with plasmid dna containing the ho.neo allele yielded g resistant yeast transformants in which one of the ho alleles was replaced by the disrupted ho.neo allele. meiotic tetrad analysis of four spored asci from these g resistant transformants gave rise to haploid heterothallic and diploid homothallic tetrad progeny. the presence of the ho.neo and ho alleles in the heterothallic and homothallic progeny was confirmed by southern blot analysis.
