homothallic switching of saccharomyces cerevisiae mating type genes by using a donor containing a large internal deletion.. . homothallic switching of the mating type genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs by a gene conversion event, replacing sequences at the expressed mat locus with a dna segment copied from one of two unexpressed loci, hml or hmr. the transposed ya or y alpha sequences are flanked by homologous regions that are believed to be essential for switching. we examined the transposition of a mating type gene (hmr alpha delta ) which contains a base pair deletion spanning the site where the ho endonuclease generates a double stranded break in mat that initiates the gene conversion event. despite the fact that the ends of the cut mat region no longer share homology with the donor hmr alpha delta , switching of mata or mat alpha to mat alpha delta was efficient. however, there was a marked increase in the number of aberrant events, especially the formation of haploid inviable fusions between mat and the hmr alpha delta donor locus.
