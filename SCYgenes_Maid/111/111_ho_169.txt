the rec gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae controls mitotic chromosomal stability, recombination and sporulation. cell type and life cycle stage specific expression of the rec mutation.. . the recessive hyperrecombination mutation rec , isolated by ultraviolet light mutagenesis of the mat alpha n+ chromosome vii disomic strain lbl (esposito et al. ), enhances the mitotic rates of spontaneous gene conversion, intergenic recombination and restitution of haploidy (due to chromosomal loss or mitotic nondisjunction) in mat alpha n+ chromosome vii disomic strains. the rec mutation does not prevent ho directed homothallic interconversion of mating types. mata/mat alpha rec /rec diploids exhibit the same degree of hyperrecombinational activity as mat alpha rec n+ chromosome vii disomics with respect to gene conversion and intragenic recombination resulting in prototrophy. when compared to mat alpha rec n+ disomics however, mata/mat alpha rec /rec diploids exhibit a ten fold reduced level of hyperrecombinational activity with respect to intergenic recombination and present no evidence of chromosomal loss or nondisjunction resulting in n monosomic segregants. mata/mat alpha rec /rec diploids are sporulation deficient. the results obtained demonstrate that the rec gene product modulates mitotic chromosomal stability and recombination and is essential for sporulation (meiosis and ascospore formation).
