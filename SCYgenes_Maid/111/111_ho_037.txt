coordination of the initiation of recombination and the reductional division in meiosis in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . early exchange (ee) genes are required for the initiation of meiotic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae. cells with mutations in several ee genes undergo an earlier reductional division (mi), which suggests that the initiation of meiotic recombination is involved in determining proper timing of the division. the different effects of null mutations on the timing of reductional division allow ee genes to be assorted into three classes. mutations in rad or rec that confer a very early reductional division; mutations in rec or rec that confer a division earlier than that of wild type (wt) cells, but later than that of mutants of the first class; and mutations in mei that do not significantly alter the timing of mi. the very early mutations are epistatic to mutations in the other two classes. we propose a model that accounts for the epistatic relationships and the communication between recombination initiation and the first division. data in this article indicate that double strand breaks (dsbs) are not the signal for the normal delay of reductional division; these experiments also confirm that mei is required for the formation of meiotic dsbs. finally, if a dsb is provided by the ho endonuclease, recombination can occur in the absence of mei and rec.
