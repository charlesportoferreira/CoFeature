diversity of the ho gene encoding an endonuclease for mating type conversion in the bottom fermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus.. . two types of ho gene were cloned, sequenced and characterized from the bottom fermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus. the ho gene present on the kb chromosome was designated sc ho (s. cerevisiae type ho), because the nucleotide sequence of its promoter region and the open reading frame (orf) was almost identical to that of the s. cerevisiae laboratory strain ho gene (lab ho). the other ho gene, designated lg ho (lager fermenting yeast specific ho), showed % and % homology with the promoter and orf of the lab ho at the nucleotide sequence level, respectively, and was located on the kb chromosome. analysis of the kb dna fragment amplified from s. bayanus type strain indicated that the nucleotide sequence of s. bayanus ho is almost identical to that of the lg ho. the ssb gene located downstream of the ho gene in s. cerevisiae was also found in the ' distal region of the sc ho, lg ho and s. bayanus ho genes. these results showed that the genetic arrangement around the ho loci both of s. pastorianus and s. bayanus is identical to s. cerevisiae. southern analysis has revealed that saccharomyces sensu stricto contain four types of ho genes; s. paradoxus type ho, the sc ho, the lg ho and s. uvarum type ho genes. this ho gene diversity provides useful information for the classification of strains belonging to saccharomyces sensu stricto. the s. pastorianus sc ho, lg ho and s. bayanus ho accession nos in the ddbj nucleotide sequence database are ab, ab and ab, respectively. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
