identification of new mediator subunits in the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . mediator was isolated from yeast on the basis of its requirement for transcriptional activation in a fully defined system. we have now identified three new members of mediator in the low molecular mass range by peptide sequence determination. these are the products of the nut, cse, and med genes. the product of the nut gene is evidently a component of mediator as well. nut and nut were earlier identified as negative regulators of the ho promoter, whereas mutations in cse affect chromosome segregation. med is a previously uncharacterized gene. the existence of these proteins in the mediator complex was verified by copurification and co immunoprecipitation with rna polymerase ii holoenzyme.
