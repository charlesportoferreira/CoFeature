role of yeast sir genes and mating type in directing dna double strand breaks to homologous and non homologous repair paths.. . eukaryotes have acquired many mechanisms to repair dna double strand breaks (dsbs) []. in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, this damage can be repaired either by homologous recombination, which depends on the rad protein, or by non homologous end joining (nhej), which depends on the proteins yku and yku [] []. how do cells choose which repair pathway to use? deletions of the sir, sir and sir genes which are involved in transcriptional silencing at telomeres and hm mating type loci (hmlalpha and hmra) in yeast [] have been reported to reduce nhej as severely as deletions of genes encoding ku proteins []. here, we report that the effect of deleting sir genes is largely attributable to derepression of silent mating type genes, although sir proteins do play a minor role in end joining. when dsbs were made on chromosomes in haploid cells that retain their mating type, sir delta mutants reduced the frequency of nhej by twofold or threefold, although plasmid end joining was not affected. in diploid cells, sir mutants showed a twofold reduction in the frequency of nhej in two assays. mating type also regulated the efficiency of dsb induced homologous recombination. in mata/matalpha diploid cells, a dsb induced by ho endonuclease was repaired % of the time by gene conversion with the homologous chromosome, whereas in diploid cells with an alpha mating type (matdelta/matalpha) repair succeeded only % of the time. mating type regulation of genes specific to haploid or diploid cells plays a key role in determining which pathways are used to repair dsbs.
