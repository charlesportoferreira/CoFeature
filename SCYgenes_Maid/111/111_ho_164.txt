a dna sequence which shows genomic variation in a, alpha and ho strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . hindiii digested dna from various mutant strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae probed with a bp nucleotide sequence in mmp derived from a mouse liver cdna clone p showed strong hybridization to a . kb dna fragment class. this was limited to the dna of cells of alpha mating type but the fragments concerned apparently do not originate from chromosome iii. the pattern of hybridization was modified in strains carrying the ho gene consistent with there being extra copies of the bkm homologous sequence in these cells. northern analysis of rna from cells synchronised in various stages of the mitotic and meiotic cell cycle probed with mmp/p indicated related transcripts in meiotic cells.
