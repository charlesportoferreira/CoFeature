ho gene polymorphism in saccharomyces industrial yeasts and application of novel ho genes to convert homothallism to heterothallism in combination with the mating type detection cassette.. . southern blot analysis of industrial yeasts showed that all top fermenting yeasts, distiller's yeasts and a proportion of wine yeasts tested in the present study produced a hybridization signal (approximately kb), corresponding to a saccharomyces cerevisiae type ho gene (sc ho). it also showed that bottom fermenting yeasts gave rise to kb and kb hybridization signals, corresponding to the sc ho gene and the lager yeast ho gene (lg ho), respectively. two wine yeasts produced a kb hybridization signal, corresponding to lg ho; and one wine yeast produced . kb and . kb hybridization bands, corresponding to a s. uvarum type ho gene (uv ho). partial nucleotide sequences of ho genes amplified from these wine yeasts perfectly matched those of lg ho and uv ho, respectively. ho disruption vectors were constructed by inserting a dominant selective marker pgkp neo and the mating type detection cassette mfalphap pho within the lg ho or uv ho gene. from transformants carrying a single disrupted ho gene, mating competent progenies were easily obtained through meiosis. moreover, mating competent derivatives appearing at very low frequency could be obtained from a double disrupted ho transformant without meiosis (even from a wine yeast lacking sporulation ability), because the sensitive phosphatase staining method allowed detection of the pho+ mating competent derivatives from confluent colonies by the random spore method. our study describes a rapid and convenient method for isolating mating competent clones from industrial yeasts.
