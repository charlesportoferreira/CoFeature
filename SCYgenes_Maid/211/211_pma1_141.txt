molecular cloning and sequencing of plasma membrane h(+) atpase gene from the salt tolerant yeast zygosaccharomyces rouxii.. . a plasma membrane h(+) atpase gene from the salt tolerant yeast zygosaccharomyces rouxii was isolated by probing the genomic dna library with a labeled dna fragment derived from the saccharomyces cerevisiae h(+) atpase gene (pma) and the nucleotide sequence of a cloned gene was determined. the gene encoded a polypeptide of molecular weight , that consisted of amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was % homologous to that of s. cerevisiae h(+) atpase and was highly similar to the conserved sequences in the plasma membrane atpase family comprising yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpases. the peptide motifs involved in the atpase functions were found in the z. rouxii h(+) atpase sequence. the result of northern analysis indicated that the size of the transcript of the z. rouxii h(+) atpase gene was the same as that of s. cerevisiae pma.
