novel genes involved in endosomal traffic in yeast revealed by suppression of a targeting defective plasma membrane atpase mutant.. . a novel genetic selection was used to identify genes regulating traffic in the yeast endosomal system. we took advantage of a temperature sensitive mutant in pma, encoding the plasma membrane atpase, in which newly synthesized pma is mislocalized to the vacuole via the endosome. diversion of mutant pma from vacuolar delivery and rerouting to the plasma membrane is a major mechanism of suppression of pma(ts). independent suppressor of pma (sop) mutants were isolated. identification of the corresponding genes reveals eight that are identical with vps genes required for delivery of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins. a second group of sop genes participates in vacuolar delivery of mutant pma but is not essential for delivery of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase y. because the biosynthetic pathway to the vacuole intersects with the endocytic pathway, internalization of a bulk membrane endocytic marker fm was assayed in the sop mutants. by this means, defective endosome to vacuole trafficking was revealed in a subset of sop mutants. another subset of sop mutants displays perturbed trafficking between endosome and golgi. impaired pro alpha factor processing in these strains was found to be due to defective recycling of the trans golgi protease kex. one of these strains defective in kex trafficking carries a mutation in sop, encoding a homologue of mammalian synaptojanin (implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling). thus, cell surface delivery of mutant pma can occur as a consequence of disturbances at several different sites in the endosomal system.
