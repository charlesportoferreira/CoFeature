modified plant plasma membrane h(+) atpase with improved transport coupling efficiency identified by mutant selection in yeast.. . transport across the plasma membrane is driven by an electrochemical gradient of h+ ions generated by the plasma membrane proton pump (h(+) atpase). random mutants of arabidopsis h(+) atpase aha were isolated by phenotypic selection of growth of transformed yeast cells in the absence of endogenous yeast h(+) atpase (pma). a trp leu substitution as well as a trp to lys deletion in the hydrophilic c terminal domain of aha conferred growth of yeast cells devoid of pma. a trp phe substitution in aha was produced gy site directed mutagenesis. the modified enzymes hydrolyzed atp at % of wild type level, had a sixfold increase in affinity for atp (from . to . mm; ph .), and had the acidic ph optimum shifted towards neutral ph. aha did not contribute significantly to h+ extrusion by transformed yeast cells. the different specifies of aha, however, displayed marked differences in initial rates of net h+ extrusion and in their ability to sustain an electrochemical h+ gradient. these results provide evidence that trp plays an important role in auto inhibition of the plant h(+) atpase and may be involved in controlling the degree of coupling between atp hydrolysis and h+ pumping. finally, these results demonstrate the usefulness of yeast as a generalized screening tool for isolating regulatory mutants of plant transporters.
