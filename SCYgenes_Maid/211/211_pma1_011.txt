stalk segment of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase. labeling with a fluorescent maleimide reveals a conformational change during glucose activation.. . glucose is well known to cause a rapid, reversible activation of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase, very likely mediated by phosphorylation of two or more ser/thr residues near the c terminus. recent mutagenesis studies have shown that glucose dependent activation can be mimicked constitutively by amino acid substitutions in stalk segment (s), an alpha helical stretch connecting the catalytic part of the atpase with transmembrane segment (miranda, m., allen, k. e., pardo, j. p., and slayman, c. w. () j. biol. chem. , ). in the present work, the fluorescent maleimide alexa has served as a probe for glucose dependent changes in the conformation of s. experiments were carried out in a &quot;c&quot; version of the atpase, from which six of nine native cysteines had been removed by site directed mutagenesis to eliminate background labeling by alexa . in this construct, three of twelve cysteines introduced at various positions along s (ac, sc, and dc) reacted with the alexa dye in a glucose independent manner, as shown by fluorescent labeling of the kda pma polypeptide and by isolation and identification of the corresponding tryptic peptides. especially significant was the fact that three additional cysteines reacted with alexa more rapidly (yc) or only (vc and lc) in plasma membranes from glucose metabolizing cells. the results support a model in which the s alpha helix undergoes a significant change in conformation to expose positions , , and during glucose dependent activation of the atpase.
