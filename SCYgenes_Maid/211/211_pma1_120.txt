overexpression in escherichia coli and purification of an atp binding peptide from the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase.. . the two major hydrophilic domains from the saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane h(+) atpase fused to glutathione s transferase have been expressed in escherichia coli. the gst l peptide contained the hydrophilic region from ala to ser. the gst sl peptide contained in addition the hydrophilic region glu to val. after solubilization of the inclusion bodies with urea, renaturation, and affinity chromatography, mg of highly purified peptides were recovered per liter of e. coli culture. the purified peptides interacted with '(') o (,, trinitrophenyl) adenosine ' triphosphate (tnp atp), the fluorescence of which was enhanced identically upon binding of either gst l or gst sl. atp competitively displaced the tnp atp binding. the observed dissociation constants for tnp atp (. microm) and atp ( mm) are close to those found for the complete native h(+) atpase protein. the fluorescence of tnp atp was sensitive to mg+ indicating the existence of a mg(+) binding site on the peptide. apparent affinity for this mg+ site was found to vary from microm at ph . to microm at ph ..
