amino acid replacements at seven different histidines in the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase reveal critical positions at his and his.. . the plasma membrane h(+) atpase (pmal) from saccharomyces cerevisiae contains histidine residues. the seven most highly conserved of these were selected as targets for oligonucleotide directed, site specific mutagenesis. substitutions at h, h, h, h, and h with a variety of amino acid residues had no effect either on cell viability or on temperature and ph growth sensitivity. in contrast, substitutions at h, located in the putative fifth membrane spanning region, with asp, gln, or arg were dominant lethal, indicating that h is essential for h(+) atpase activity. the mutations hq and hr, but not he, located in the hydrophilic beta stranded domain, were tolerated in normal growth conditions. growth of hq mutants was sensitive to acid ph, indicating impaired in vivo atpase activity. the hq and hr mutants showed increased in vitro atpase specific activity, increased vanadate resistance, increased proton competition of vanadate sensitivity, accelerated atp hydrolysis rates at a substrate concentration much lower than the km, and slightly uncoupled proton pumping. the most reasonable hypothesis which would take into account these observations is that h would not be involved in the h+ transport process but rather in the e to e transition step of the atp hydrolysis catalytic cycle.
