regulation and ph dependent expression of a bilaterally truncated yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase.. . constitutive, chromosomal expression of yeast pma deletion alleles in saccharomyces cerevisiae yielded functional, truncated forms of the plasma membrane h+ atpase which were independently capable of supporting wild type yeast growth rates. deletion of amino terminal residues affected neither the enzyme's activity nor its responsiveness to changes in glucose metabolism. by contrast, removal of carboxy terminal amino acids produced an enzyme with a vmax that was relatively insensitive to glucose dependent metabolic status and with a km that was significantly lower than that of the wild type enzyme. these effects were exaggerated when the amino and carboxy terminal deletions were combined in a bilaterally truncated h+ atpase, suggesting that the amino terminus may have a subtle role in modulating atpase activity. in pmadeltadelta cells cultured at ph , plasma membrane h+ atpase levels were much lower than those in cells expressing a wild type atpase. increased expression levels could be achieved by growing the pmadeltadelta mutant at ph , a result that was at least partially due to a sustained, elevated transcription of pmadeltadelta mrna. our observations suggest that intracellular proton balance can be maintained by regulation of the activity and/or quantity of h+ atpase in the plasma membrane.
