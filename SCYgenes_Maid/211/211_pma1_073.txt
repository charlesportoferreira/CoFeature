the c terminus of yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase is essential for the regulation of this enzyme by heat shock protein hsp, but not for stress activation.. . several stresses cause additional activation to the glucose stimulated plasma membrane h+ atpase activity of yeast, but it is not clear how this is achieved. we recently reported that cells lacking the integral plasma membrane heat shock protein hsp display enhanced increases in plasma membrane h+ atpase activity with either heat shock or weak organic acid stress (piper, p.w., ortiz calderon, c., holyoak, c., coote, p. and cole, m. () cell stress and chaperones , ), indicating that the stress induction of hsp acts to reduce stress stimulation of the h+ atpase. in this study it is shown that hsp acts to reduce the vmax of h+ atpase in heat shocked cells. its action is lost with deletion of the c terminal amino acids of the h+ atpase, a deletion that does not abolish the stress stimulation of this enzyme. mutation of the thr residue within the c terminal domain of h+ atpase, a potential site of phosphorylation by the ca+ calmodulin dependent protein kinase, also abolishes any effect of hsp. hsp may therefore be acting on a thr phosphorylated form of the h+ atpase.
