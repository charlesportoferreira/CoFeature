mop (sla) affects the abundance of the plasma membrane h(+) atpase of saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the abundance of yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase on the cell surface is tightly regulated. modifier of pma (mop) mutants were isolated as enhancers of the mutant phenotypes of pma mutants. mop mutations reduce the abundance and activity of pma protein on the plasma membrane without affecting the abundance of other prominent plasma membrane proteins. the mop gene encodes a kda protein that has previously been identified both as a gene affecting the yeast cytoskeleton (sla) (holtzman, d.a., yang, s., and drubin, d. g. () j. cell biol. , ) and as a gene affecting endocytosis (end) (raths, s., roher, j., crausaz, f., and riezman, h. () j. cell biol. , ). in some strains, mop (sla) is essential for cell viability; in others, a deletion mutant is temperature sensitive for growth. mop mutations do not reduce the transcription of pma nor do they lead to the accumulation of pma protein in any intracellular compartment. an epitope tagged mop protein behaves as a plasma membrane associated protein whose abundance is proportional to its level of gene expression. over expression of mop relieved the toxicity caused by the over expression of pma from a high copy plasmid; conversely, the growth of mop strains was inhibited by the presence of a single extra copy of pma. we conclude that mop (sla) encodes a plasma membrane associated protein that is required for the accumulation and/or maintenance of plasma membrane h(+) atpase on the cell surface.
