possible involvement of a phosphatidylinositol type signaling pathway in glucose induced activation of plasma membrane h(+) atpase and cellular proton extrusion in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . addition of glucose to cells of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae causes rapid activation of plasma membrane h(+) atpase and a stimulation of cellular h+ extrusion. we show that addition of diacylglycerol and other activators of protein kinase c to intact cells also activates the h(+) atpase and causes at the same time a stimulation of h+ extrusion from the cells. both effects are reversed by addition of staurosporine, a protein kinase c inhibitor. addition of staurosporine or calmidazolium, an inhibitor of ca+/calmodulin dependent protein kinases, separately, causes a partial inhibition of glucose induced h(+) atpase activation and stimulation of cellular h+ extrusion; together they cause a more potent inhibition. addition of neomycin, which complexes with phosphatidylinositol , bisphosphate, or addition of compound /, a phospholipase c inhibitor, also causes near complete inhibition. diacylglycerol and other protein kinase c activators had no effect on the activity of the k(+) uptake system and the activity of trehalase and glucose induced activation of the k(+) uptake system and trehalase was not inhibited by neomycin, supporting the specificity of the effects observed on the h(+) atpase. the results support a model in which glucose induced activation of h(+) atpase is mediated by a phosphatidylinositol type signaling pathway triggering phosphorylation of the enzyme both by protein kinase c and one or more ca+/calmodulin dependent protein kinases.
