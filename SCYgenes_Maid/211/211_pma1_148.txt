deletion analysis of yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase and identification of a regulatory domain at the carboxyl terminus.. . the function of the amino and carboxyl terminal domains of the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase have been investigated by constructing deletions in vitro and selectively expressing the mutant enzymes in vivo. the first amino acids are dispensable but deletion of a further amino acids greatly decreases the appearance of the enzyme in the plasma membrane. membrane localization is also prevented by carboxyl terminal deletions which include the last hydrophobic stretch, but the last amino acids of the atpase are not required. removal of the last amino acids produces an enzyme in glucose starved cells with the kinetic parameters of the wild type atpase activated by glucose fermentation. this region seems to constitute a regulatory domain.
