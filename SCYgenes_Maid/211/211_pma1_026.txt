the growth of mdp/rsp mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae is affected by mutations in the atp binding domain of the plasma membrane h+ atpase.. . mutations in the pma gene, encoding plasma membrane h+ atpase, were isolated that are able to suppress the temperature sensitivity (ts) phenotype of mdp mutations located in rsp, the ubiquitin protein ligase gene. the mdp mutants were previously found to change the mitochondrial/cytosolic distribution of modp i, the trna modifying enzyme, and to affect fluid phase endocytosis. the data presented reveal that mdp mutants are also ph sensitive, and hypersensitive to hygromycin b and paromomycin. the ts phenotype, hygromycin b and paromomycin sensitivity are suppressed by pmal t, but the ph sensitivity, the effect of mdp on modp i cytoplasmic/mitochondrial localization and endocytosis are not. characterization of pmal t revealed the substitution of amino acid g()v in the atp binding domain of the h+ atpase. our results indicate that rsp ubiquitin protein ligase may also influence, in addition to protein distribution, the functioning of plasma membrane h+ atpase and the response of cells to stress.
