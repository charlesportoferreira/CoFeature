quality control in the yeast secretory pathway. a misfolded pma h+ atpase reveals two checkpoints.. . the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase, encoded by pma, is delivered to the cell surface via the secretory pathway and has recently emerged as an excellent system for identifying quality control mechanisms along the pathway. in the present study, we have tracked the biogenesis of pma ga, a misfolded mutant form of the h(+) atpase. although this mutant atpase is arrested transiently in the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum, it does not become a substrate for endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation nor does it appear to stimulate an unfolded protein response. instead, pma ga accumulates in karp containing vesicular tubular clusters that resemble those previously described in mammalian cells. like their mammalian counterparts, the yeast vesicular tubular clusters may correspond to specific exit ports from the endoplasmic reticulum, since pma ga eventually escapes from them (still in a misfolded, trypsin sensitive form) to reach the plasma membrane. by comparison with wild type atpase, pma ga spends a short half life at the plasma membrane before being removed and sent to the vacuole for degradation in a process that requires both endp and pepp. finally, in a separate set of experiments, pma ga was found to impose its phenotype on co expressed wild type atpase, transiently retarding the wild type protein in the er and later stimulating its degradation in the vacuole. both effects serve to lower the steady state amount of wild type atpase in the plasma membrane and, thus, can explain the co dominant genetic behavior of the ga mutation. taken together, the results of this study establish pma ga as a useful new probe for the yeast secretory system.
