ion tolerance of saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking the ca+/cam dependent phosphatase (calcineurin) is improved by mutations in ure or pma.. . calcineurin is a conserved, ca+/cam stimulated protein phosphatase required for ca+ dependent signaling in many cell types. in yeast, calcineurin is essential for growth in high concentrations of na+, li+, mn+, and oh , and for maintaining viability during prolonged treatment with mating pheromone. in contrast, the growth of calcineurin mutant yeast is better than that of wild type cells in the presence of high concentrations of ca+. we identified mutations that suppress multiple growth defects of calcineurin deficient yeast (cnbdelta or cnadelta cnadelta). mutations in ure suppress the sensitivity of calcineurin mutants to na+, li+, and mn+, and increase their survival during treatment with mating pheromone. ure mutations require both the transcription factor glnp and the na+ atpase pmrp to confer na+ and li+ tolerance. mutations in pma, which encodes the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase, also suppress many growth defects of calcineurin mutants. pma mutants display growth phenotypes that are opposite to those of calcineurin mutants; they are resistant to na+, li+, and mn+, and sensitive to ca+. we also show that calcineurin mutants are sensitive to aminoglycoside antibiotics such as hygromycin b while pma mutants are more resistant than wild type. furthermore, pma and calcineurin mutations have antagonistic effects on intracellular [na+] and [ca+]. finally, we show that yeast expressing a constitutively active allele of calcineurin display pma like phenotypes, and that membranes from these yeast have decreased levels of pmap activity. these studies further characterize the roles that ure and pma play in regulating intracellular ion homeostasis.
