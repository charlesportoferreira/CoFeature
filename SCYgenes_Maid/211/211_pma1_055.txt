the plasma membrane h(+) atpase from the biotrophic rust fungus uromyces fabae. molecular characterization of the gene (pma) and functional expression of the enzyme in yeast.. . to study the molecular basis of biotrophic nutrient uptake by plant parasitic rust fungi, the gene (uf pma) encoding the plasma membrane h(+) atpase from uromyces fabae was isolated. uf pma exists probably as a single gene. however, two nearly identical sequences were identified; the similarity apparently is due to two uf pma alleles in the dikaryotic hyphae. multiple uf pma transcripts were observed during early rust development, and reduced amounts of a single uf pma mrna were observed in haustoria and rust infected leaves. this is in contrast to elevated enzyme activity in haustoria compared to germinated spores (c. struck, m. hahn, and k. mendgen. fungal genet. biol. . , ). unexpectedly, the pma encoded rust protein is more similar to h(+) atpases from plants (% identity) than from ascomycetous fungi (% identity). when the rust pma cdna was expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae, both the wild type enzyme and a mutant derivative (delta ) deleted for the c terminal amino acids were able to support growth of a yeast strain lacking its own h(+) atpases. compared to the wild type, the delta mutant enzyme displayed increased affinity to atp, a higher vanadate sensitivity, and a more alkaline ph optimum. these results indicate that the c terminal region of the rust enzyme exhibits auto regulatory properties.
