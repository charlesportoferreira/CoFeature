characterization of plasma membrane h(+) atpase from salt tolerant yeast candida versatilis.. . plasma membrane was isolated from the salt tolerant yeast candida versatilis and the atpase in plasma membrane was characterized. the atpase was a typical h(+) atpase with similar properties to the saccharomyces cerevisiae and zygosaccharomyces rouxii enzymes. it was reacted with antibody (igg) raised against s. cerevisiae plasma membrane h(+) atpase. the atpase activity was not changed by adding nacl and kcl to the assay solutions, but was increased by nh+, especially by ammonium sulfate. in vivo stimulation of atpase activity was observed by the addition of nacl into the culture medium, as observed in z. rouxii. no in vivo activation of h(+) atpase by glucose metabolism was observed in c. versatilis cells and the activity was independent of the growth phase, like z. rouxii and unlike s. cerevisiae cells.
