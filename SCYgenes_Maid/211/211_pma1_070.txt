exploring an antifungal target in the plasma membrane h(+) atpase of fungi.. . the plasma membrane h(+) atpase is a promising new antifungal target that is readily probed with the sulfhydryl reactive reagent omeprazole. inhibition of the h(+) atpase by omeprazole is closely linked to cell killing, and it has been suggested that enzyme inhibition may result from a covalent interaction within the first two transmembrane segments (m and m) (monk et al. () biochim. biophys. acta , ). in this study, the molecular nature of this interaction was examined by screening a series of well characterized pma mutations residing in the first two transmembrane segments of the h(+) atpase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. only two pma mutants, ag and gd,gc, were found to significantly decrease the sensitivity of cells for omeprazole. in contrast, enhanced sensitivity was observed at a number of positions, with dc(a) and mc producing the most significant increases in sensitivity. the introduction of cysteine at various locations within this region only marginally affected omeprazole sensitivity, suggesting that this region was not a direct site of covalent modification. rather, its conformation influences omeprazole binding at some other locus. in order to determine the sidedness of the omeprazole interaction, a novel in vitro assay system was exploited that utilized liposomes co reconstituted with the h(+) atpase and the light driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin. omeprazole was found to completely inhibit proton transport by the h(+) atpase at microm in this system. an asymmetrically distributed chemical trap system involving glutathione was used to demonstrate that this inhibition appears localized to the extracellular portion of the enzyme. this work indicates that omeprazole can inhibit the h(+) atpase from its extracellular face, and this inhibition is influenced by changes in the m, m region of the protein.
