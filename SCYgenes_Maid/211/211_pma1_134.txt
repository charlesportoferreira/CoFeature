evidence for coupling between membrane and cytoplasmic domains of the yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase. an analysis of intragenic revertants of pma .. . a genetic approach was used to identify interacting portions of the plasma membrane h(+) atpase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the cellular sensitivity of the pma strain (sf) to low external ph and to nh+ was used to select intragenic revertants of two classes. phenotypically wild type full revertants and partial revertants that were low ph resistant but retained resistance to hygromycin b. all full revertants had s restored. among five partial revertants mapping to the original site within the phosphorylation domain, sl and sv were each found twice. one revertant contained an ev substitution adjacent to the original sf alteration. four of independently isolated second site revertants mapped to one site, vf, in the proposed phosphatase domain. mutations within the proposed phosphatase and phosphorylation domains resulted in enzymes with increased vanadate sensitivity relative to the vanadate insensitive sf enzyme. these results suggest that sites s, e, and v contribute to a vanadate (pi) binding domain or are able to interact with such a site within the catalytic domain. the remaining nine partial second site revertants mapped to six sites within the putative transmembrane regions. mutations within the transmembrane region had less of an effect on vanadate sensitivity. most revertant enzymes showed small but significant increases in the rate of atp hydrolysis relative to the sf enzyme. several enzymes no longer displayed the acid sensitive ph dependence seen in the sf enzyme. these data provide novel evidence for an interaction between putative transmembrane helices and and the atp hydrolytic portion of the enzyme.
