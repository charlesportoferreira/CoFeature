replacement of the promoter of the yeast plasma membrane atpase gene by a galactose dependent promoter and its physiological consequences.. . in order to probe the physiological role of the yeast plasma membrane atpase we have replaced the constitutive promoter of its gene by a galactose dependent promoter. the resulting cells stop growing on glucose medium when the preformed atpase is diluted to % of normal. there is a correlation between atpase activity and both proton efflux from the cells and amino acid transport. a large proportion of growth arrested cells appear enlarged and with several buds containing nuclei.
