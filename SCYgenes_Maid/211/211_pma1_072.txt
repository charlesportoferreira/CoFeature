intracellular sequestration of sodium by a novel na+/h+ exchanger in yeast is enhanced by mutations in the plasma membrane h+ atpase. insights into mechanisms of sodium tolerance.. . sodium tolerance in yeast is disrupted by mutations in calcineurin, a ca+/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase, which is required for modulation of na+ uptake and efflux mechanisms. five na+ tolerant mutants were isolated by selecting for suppressors of calcineurin mutations, and mapped to the pma gene, encoding the plasma membrane h+ atpase. one mutant, pma alpha, which has the single amino acid change glu &gt; lys at a highly conserved site within the catalytic domain of the atpase, was analyzed in detail to determine the mechanism of na+ tolerance. after exposure to na+ in the culture medium, na influx in the pma mutant was reduced fold relative to control, consistent with a similar decrease in atpase activity. efflux of na from intact cells was relatively unchanged in the pma mutant. however, selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane revealed that mutant cells retained up to % of intracellular na+ within a slowly exchanging pool. we show that nhx, a novel gene homologous to the mammalian nhe family of na+/h+ exchangers, is required for na+ sequestration in yeast and contributes to the na+ tolerant phenotype of pma alpha.
