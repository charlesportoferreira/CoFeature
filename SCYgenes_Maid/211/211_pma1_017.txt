expression and characterization of the anion transporter homologue ynlw in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a search of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae genome has revealed an open reading frame, ynlw, which encodes a amino acid protein that shows sequence similarity to the family of mammalian cl /hco anion exchangers and na+/hco cotransporters. this yeast protein also has a very similar hydropathy profile to the mammalian hco transporters, indicating a similar membrane topology and structure. a v epitope and his tagged version of ynlwp was expressed in yeast and was localized to the plasma membrane by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence labeling. the protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography and was found not to be n glycosylated. the protein's mobility on sds page gels was not altered by treatment with n glycanase f, alpha mannosidase, or by mutation of each of the five consensus n glycosylation sites. the protein did not bind to concanavalin a by lectin blotting or lectin affinity chromatography. the expressed protein bound specifically to a stilbene disulfonate inhibitor resin (sits affi gel), and this binding could be competed by certain anions (hco , cl , no , and i ) but not by others (so( ) and po( )). these results suggest that the yeast gene ynlw encodes a nonglycosylated anion transport protein, localized to the plasma membrane.
