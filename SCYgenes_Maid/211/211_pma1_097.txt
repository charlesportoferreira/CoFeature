vph mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae require calcineurin for growth and are defective in vacuolar h(+) atpase assembly.. . we have characterized a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strain that is hypersensitive to cyclosporin a (csa) and fk, immunosuppressants that inhibit calcineurin, a serine threonine specific phosphatase (ppb). a single nuclear mutation, designated cev for calcineurin essential for viability, is responsible for the csa fk sensitive phenotype. the peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases cyclophilin a and fkbp, respectively, mediate csa and fk toxicity in the cev mutant strain. we demonstrate that cev is an allele of the vph gene and that vph mutant strains fail to assemble the vacuolar h(+) atpase (v atpase). the vph gene was mapped on chromosome viii and is predicted to encode a amino acid ( kd) protein with no identity to other known proteins. we find that calcineurin is essential for viability in many mutant strains with defects in v atpase function or vacuolar acidification. in addition, we find that calcineurin modulates extracellular acidification in response to glucose, which we propose occurs via calcineurin regulation of the plasma membrane h(+) atpase pma. taken together, our findings suggest calcineurin plays a general role in the regulation of cation transport and homeostasis.
