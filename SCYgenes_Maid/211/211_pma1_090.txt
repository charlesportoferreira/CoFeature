probing conserved regions of the cytoplasmic loop segment linking transmembrane segments and of the saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane h+ atpase.. . genetic probing was used to examine conserved amino acid clusters in the first cytoplasmic loop domain (loop) linking transmembrane segments and of the plasma membrane h+ atpase from saccharomyces cerevisiae. deletion of the loop region in pma resulted in a defective enzyme. scanning alanine mutagenesis of conserved residues produced lethal cell phenotypes in of amino acids, suggesting major enzyme defects. most viable mutants showed growth characteristics that were comparable to wild type. two mutations, ia and da, produced reduced growth rates, hygromycin b resistance, and low ph sensitivity, which are phenotypes associated with defects in the h+ atpase. however, both mutant enzymes displayed near normal kinetics for atp hydrolysis in vitro. localized random mutagenesis was also performed at sites glu, val, and ile, which all showed lethal phenotypes upon conversion to alanine. amino acids with polar side groups could substitute for glu, while val could not tolerate polar side group moieties. nine mutations at ile proved lethal, including k, r, e, p, h, n, v, g, and a, while functional enzyme was obtained with s, c, m, and l. normal rates and extents of ph gradient formation were observed for all mutant enzymes, except ia and da. detailed analysis of the ia enzyme indicated that it hydrolyzed atp like wild type, but it appeared to inefficiently couple atp hydrolysis to proton transport. in total, these results affirm that conserved amino acids in loop are important to h+ atpase function, and purturbations in this region can alter the efficiency of energy coupling.
