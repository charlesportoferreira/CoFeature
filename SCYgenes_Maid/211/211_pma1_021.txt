mechanisms of saccharomyces cerevisiae pma h+ atpase inactivation by fe+, ho and fenton reagents.. . although considerably more oxidation resistant than other p type atpases, the yeast pma h+ atpase of saccharomyces cerevisiae sy secretory vesicles was inactivated by ho, fe+, fe and cu fenton reagents. inactivation by fe+ required the presence of oxygen and hence involved auto oxidation of fe+ to fe+. the highest fe ( microm) and ho ( mm) concentrations used produced about the same effect. inactivation by the fenton reagent depended more on fe+ content than on ho concentration, occurred only when fe+ was added to the vesicles first and was only slightly reduced by scavengers (mannitol, tris, nan, dmso) and by chelators (edta, egta, dtpa, bpds, bipyridine, , phenanthroline). inactivation by fe and cu fenton reagent was the same; the identical inactivation pattern found for both reagents under anaerobic conditions showed that both reagents act via oh*. the lipid peroxidation blocker bht prevented fenton induced rise in lipid peroxidation in both whole cells and in isolated membrane lipids but did not protect the h+ atpase in secretory vesicles against inactivation. atp partially protected the enzyme against peroxide and the fenton reagent in a way resembling the protection it afforded against sh specific agents. the results indicate that fe+ and the fenton reagent act via metal catalyzed oxidation at specific metal binding sites, very probably sh containing amino acid residues. deferrioxamine, which prevents the redox cycling of fe+, blocked h+ atpase inactivation by fe+ and the fenton reagent but not that caused by ho, which therefore seems to involve a direct non radical attack. fe fenton reagent caused fragmentation of the h+ atpase molecule, which, in western blots, did not give rise to defined fragments bands but merely to smears.
