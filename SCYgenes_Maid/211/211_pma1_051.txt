differential exposure of surface epitopes in the beta strand region of loop of the yeast h+ atpase during catalysis.. . the plasma membrane h+ atpase of yeast assumes distinct conformational states during its catalytic cycle. to better understand structural changes in the loop domain, a catalytically important cytoplasmic loop segment linking transmembrane segments and , surface epitopes were examined at different stages of catalysis. a polyclonal rabbit antibody was prepared to a fusion protein consisting of loop and the maltose binding protein. this antibody was affinity purified to produce a loop specific fraction that could be used in competition enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to assess surface exposure of the loop epitopes. it was found that in an e conformation stabilized with either adenosine ' (beta,gamma imino)triphosphate (amp pnp) or adp, less than % of the loop epitopes were accessible on native enzyme. however, when the enzyme was stabilized in an e state with atp plus vanadate, approximately % of the surface epitopes on loop became accessible to antibody. the remaining % of the loop epitopes were fully occluded in the native enzyme and never showed surface exposure. enzyme linked immunosorbent assays utilizing fusion proteins consisting of loop subdomains demonstrated that all of the available epitopes were contained in the beta strand region (glu val ) of loop. the epitopes that were differentially exposed during catalysis were included in regions upstream and downstream of the highly conserved tges sequence. our results suggest that during catalysis either the beta strand region of loop or an interacting domain undergoes substantial structural rearrangement that facilitates epitope exposure.
