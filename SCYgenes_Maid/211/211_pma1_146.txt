cyclic amp controls the plasma membrane h+ atpase activity from saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the thermosensitive g arrested cdc mutant from saccharomyces cerevisiae, defective in adenylate cyclase activity, was shifted to restrictive temperature. after h incubation at this temperature, the plasma membrane h+ atpase activity of cdc was reduced to %, whereas that in mitochondria doubled. similar data were obtained with cdc, another thermosensitive g arrested mutant modified in the camp pathway. in contrast, the atpase activities of the g arrested mutant cdc, defective in pyruvate kinase, were not affected after h incubation at restrictive temperature. in the double mutants cdc cas and cdc cas, addition of extracellular camp prevented the modifications of atpase activities observed in the single mutants cdc and cdc. these data indicate that camp acts as a positive effector on the h+ atpase activity of plasma membranes and as a negative effector on that of mitochondria.
