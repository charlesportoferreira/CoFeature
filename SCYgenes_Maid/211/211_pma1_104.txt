c terminal deletion analysis of plant plasma membrane h(+) atpase. yeast as a model system for solute transport across the plant plasma membrane.. . the plasma membrane proton pump (h(+) atpase) energizes solute uptake by secondary transporters. wild type arabidopsis plasma membrane h(+) atpase (aha) and truncated h(+) atpase lacking , , , , , , , and c terminal amino acids were produced in yeast. all aha species were correctly targeted to the yeast plasma membrane and, in addition, accumulated in internal membranes. removal of c terminal residues from aha produced a high affinity state of plant h(+) atpase with a low km value (. mm) for atp. removal of an additional amino acids from the c terminus resulted in a significant increase in molecular activity of the enzyme. there was a close correlation between molecular activity of the various plant h(+) atpase species and their ability to complement mutants of the endogenous yeast plasma membrane h(+) atpase (pma). this correlation demonstrates that, at least in this heterologous host, activation of h(+) atpase is a prerequisite for proper energization of the plasma membrane.
