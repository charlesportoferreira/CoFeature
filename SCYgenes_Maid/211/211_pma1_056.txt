influence of monovalent cations on yeast cytoplasmic and vacuolar ph.. . the effects of monovalent cations on the internal ph of yeast were studied. our former procedure was modified, inducing maximal alkalinization of the cells with mm nhoh instead of tris base. the ph values were lower than reported before (pena et al., j. baceteriol. , ). with glucose as substrate, the internal cytoplasmic ph reached higher values when incubating at an external ph of ., as compared to ph .. monovalent cations added approximately min after glucose produced a further increase in the internal ph, which was higher at a previous incubation ph of . than that observed at ph .. the selectivity of the changes followed a similar order to that of the transport system for monovalent cations. when incubating cells with glucose for more than min, the initial changes of the internal ph appeared to be regulated by the cell. however, under the fluorescence microscope, it was observed that pyranine, which was confined to the cytoplasm during the first min, was progressively concentrated in the vacuole. by studying the fluorescence changes of cells electroporated and then incubated with glucose or glucose plus potassium, we could follow the internal ph of this organelle, obtaining values within the range reported by other authors. also, in cells preincubated with glucose for min, and electroporated afterwards, the fluorescence of pyranine, which only entered the cytoplasm, allowed us to measure the ph of this compartment, showing that it was more alkaline than the vacuole. moreover, the cytoplasmic ph increased upon addition of glucose or potassium. the vacuolar ph, on the other hand, increased upon addition of potassium after glucose, but decreased upon addition of glucose. in addition, incubation of the cells with glucose with or without pyranine produced vesiculation of the vacuole.
