screening for modulators of spermine tolerance identifies sky, the sr protein kinase of saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a regulator of polyamine transport and ion homeostasis.. . although most cells are capable of transporting polyamines, the mechanism that regulates polyamine transport in eukaryotes is still largely unknown. using a genetic screen for clones capable of restoring spermine sensitivity to spermine tolerant mutants of saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have demonstrated that skyp, a recently identified sr protein kinase, is a key regulator of polyamine transport. yeast cells deleted for sky developed tolerance to toxic levels of spermine, while overexpression of skyp in wild type cells increased their sensitivity to spermine. expression of the wild type skyp but not of a catalytically inactive mutant restored sensitivity to spermine. sky disruption results in dramatically reduced uptake of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. in addition to spermine tolerance, skydelta cells exhibit increased tolerance to lithium and sodium ions but somewhat increased sensitivity to osmotic shock. the observed halotolerance suggests potential regulatory interaction between the transport of polyamines and inorganic ions, as suggested in the case of the ptkp, a recently described regulator of polyamine transport. we demonstrate that these two kinases act in two different signaling pathways. while deletion or overexpression of sky did not significantly affect pmap activity, the ability of overexpressed skyp, ptkp, and ptkp to increase sensitivity to licl depends on the integrity of ppz but not of ena.
