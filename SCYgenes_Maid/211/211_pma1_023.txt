a putative proton binding site of plasma membrane h(+) atpase identified through homology modelling.. . we have used the . a structure of the rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum ca(+) atpase isoform a, sercaa [toyoshima, c., nakasako, m., nomura, h. and ogawa, h. () nature , ], to build models by homology modelling of two plasma membrane (pm) h(+) atpases, arabidopsis thaliana aha and saccharomyces cerevisiae pma. we propose that in both yeast and plant pm h(+) atpases a strictly conserved aspartate in transmembrane segment (m) (d(aha)/d(pma)), and three backbone carbonyls in m (i(aha)/i(pma), g(aha)/i(pma) and i(aha)/v(pma)) comprise a binding site for ho(+), suggesting a previously unknown mechanism for transport of protons. comparison with the structure of the sercaa made it feasible to suggest a possible receptor region for the c terminal auto inhibitory domain extending from the phosphorylation and anchor domains into the transmembrane region.
