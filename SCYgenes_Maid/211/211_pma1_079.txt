reactive cysteines of the yeast plasma membrane h+ atpase (pma). mapping the sites of inactivation by n ethylmaleimide.. . we have taken advantage of cysteine mutants described previously (petrov, v. v., and slayman, c. w. () j. biol. chem. , ) to map the sites at which n ethylmaleimide (nem) reacts with the plasma membrane h+atpase (pma) of saccharomyces cerevisiae. when membrane vesicles containing the atpase were incubated with nem, six of nine mutants with single cysteine substitutions showed sensitivity similar to the wild type enzyme. by contrast, ca and ca were inactivated more slowly than the wild type control, and the c, a double mutant was completely resistant, indicating that cys and cys are nem reactive residues. in the presence of mm mgadp, the wild type atpase was partially protected against nem; parallel experiments with the ca and ca mutants showed that the protection occurred at cys , located in or near the nucleotide binding site. unexpectedly, the inactivation of the ca atpase was approximately fold more rapid than in the case of the wild type enzyme. experiments with double mutants made it clear that this resulted from an acidic shift in pka and a consequent acceleration of the reaction rate at cys . one simple interpretation is that substitution of cys leads to a local conformational change within the central hydrophilic domain. consistent with this idea, the reaction of fluorescein ' isothiocyanate at lys was also stimulated approximately . fold by the ca mutation. taken together, the results of this study provide new information about the reactivity of individual cys residues within the atpase and pave the way to tag specific sites for structural and functional studies of the enzyme.
