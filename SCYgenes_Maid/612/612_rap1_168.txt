detection and isolation of dna binding proteins using single pulse ultraviolet laser crosslinking.. . ultraviolet laser crosslinking of proteins to dna is a potentially powerful tool for studying protein nucleic acid interactions in vitro and in vivo. we describe a simple, rapid, and reliable procedure to detect protein dna complexes using crosslinking with a single ns pulse of nm light from a uv laser. the method provides an estimate of the molecular mass of dna binding proteins in crude extracts or in purified preparations. it is also well suited for kinetic analysis, and can detect transient protein dna interactions as well as interactions that are labile in band shift gels. we show that the method is generally applicable to dna binding proteins. in addition, we describe a technique to isolate crosslinked protein dna complexes from crude extracts in one rapid step, using biotinylated dna probes. ultraviolet laser crosslinking is a useful alternative or complement to commonly used techniques for the detection and characterization of dna binding proteins.
