sirp domains involved in the initiation of telomeric silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that tethering of sirp at the subtelomeric/telomeric junction restores silencing in strains containing rap p, a mutant protein unable to recruit sirp. this tethered silencing assay serves as a model system for the early events that follow recruitment of silencing factors, a process we term initiation. a series of lexa fusion proteins in frame with various sirp fragments were constructed and tested for their ability to support tethered silencing. interestingly, a region comprising only the c terminal amino acids, termed the c terminal domain (ctd), is both necessary and sufficient for restoration of silencing. curiously, the lexa sir(n) mutant protein overcomes the requirement for the ctd, possibly by unmasking a cryptic initiation site. a second domain spanning amino acids , termed the nonessential for initiation domain (nid), is dispensable for the sirp function in initiation, but is required for the recruitment of the sirp c terminus. in addition, in the absence of the n terminal amino acids, the nid negatively influences ctd activity. this suggests the presence of a third region, consisting of the n terminal half ( ) of sirp, termed the positive regulatory domain (prd), which is required to initiate silencing in the presence of the nid. these data suggest that the ctd &quot;active&quot; site is under both positive and negative control mediated by multiple sirp domains.
