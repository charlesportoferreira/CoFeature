meiosis specific double strand dna breaks at the his recombination hot spot in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. control in cis and trans.. . the region of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome iii located between the ' end of the his gene and the ' end of the adjacent bik gene has a very high level of meiotic recombination. in wild type strains, a meiosis specific double strand dna break occurs in the hot spot region. this break is absent in strains in which the transcription factors rapp, basp, and basp cannot bind to the region upstream of his. in strains with levels of recombination that are higher than those of the wild type, the break is found at elevated levels. the linear relationship between hot spot activity and the frequency of double strand dna breaks suggests that these lesions are responsible for initiating recombination at the his recombination hot spot.
