the c terminal silencing domain of rapp is essential for the repression of ribosomal protein genes in response to a defect in the secretory pathway.. . we have previously shown that a functional secretory pathway is essential for continued ribosome synthesis in saccharomyces cerevisiae. when a temperature sensitive mutant defective in the secretory pathway is transferred to the non permissive temperature, transcription of both rrna genes and ribosomal protein genes is nearly abolished. in order to define the cis acting element(s) of ribosomal protein genes sensitive to a defect in the secretory pathway, we have constructed a series of fusion genes containing the cyh promoter region, with various deletions, fused to lacz. each fusion gene for which transcription is detected is subject to the repression. rapp is the transcriptional activator for most ribosomal protein genes, as well as having an important role in silencing in the vicinity of telomeres and at the silent mating type loci. to assess its role in the repression of transcription by the defect in the secretory pathway, we have introduced rap mutations. the replacement of wild type rapp by rapp truncated at the c terminal region caused substantial attenuation of the repression. furthermore, we have demonstrated that the rapp truncation affects the repression of tcm , encoding ribosomal protein l, which has no rapp binding site in its upstream regulatory region. these results suggest that the repression of transcription of ribosomal protein genes by a secretory defect is mediated through rapp, but does not require a rapp binding site within the uas.
