saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression changes during rotating wall vessel suspension culture.. . this study utilizes saccharomyces cerevisiae to study genetic responses to suspension culture. the suspension culture system used in this study is the high aspect ratio vessel, one type of the rotating wall vessel, that provides a high rate of gas exchange necessary for rapidly dividing cells. cells were grown in the high aspect ratio vessel, and dna microarray and metabolic analyses were used to determine the resulting changes in yeast gene expression. a significant number of genes were found to be up or downregulated by at least twofold as a result of rotational growth. by using gibbs promoter alignment, clusters of genes were examined for promoter elements mediating these genetic changes. candidate binding motifs similar to the rapp binding site and the stress responsive element were identified in the promoter regions of differentially regulated genes. this study shows that, as in higher order organisms, s. cerevisiae changes gene expression in response to rotational culture and also provides clues for investigations into the signaling pathways involved in gravitational response.
