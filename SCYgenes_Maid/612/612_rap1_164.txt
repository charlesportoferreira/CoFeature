differential transcription of the two saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encoding elongation factor .. . the single polypeptide chain of elongation factor (ef ) is encoded by two saccharomyces cerevisiae genes (eft and eft) with unique flanking sequences. one gene is necessary and either is sufficient for cell viability. in the present work, we have analyzed the transcription of eft and eft. although both genes harbor multiple transcription start points, eft initiates primarily at residue c at and eft at residue c at . several candidate tata boxes were identified in each gene. deletion analysis employing lacz promoter fusions demonstrated that the promoter for eft is located within a bp region beginning nucleotides (nt) upstream from the start atg codon. this region contains two overlapping sequences with homology to the consensus binding site for the yeast transcription factor, rapp/grfp/tuf. in contrast, the sequences essential for the transcription of eft were localized to the region between the start atg and the stop codon of the vps gene that terminates nt upstream on the same strand. analysis of promoter strengths using lacz fusions indicated that the promoter for eft is approx. . fold more active than that of eft. analysis of the steady state levels of mrnas revealed that eft contributes approx. % of the total ef mrna while the remaining % is produced by eft. we conclude that the difference in expression of eft and eft is due to the differential transcription of their promoters.
