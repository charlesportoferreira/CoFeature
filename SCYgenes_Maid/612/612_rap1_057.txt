yeast ku protein plays a direct role in telomeric silencing and counteracts inhibition by rif proteins.. . ykup/ykup, the yeast ku protein homologue, is a dna end binding heterodimer involved in non homologous end joining. it also binds to telomeres, where it plays an important role in the maintenance of telomeric dna structure [] [] [] [] []. ku protein, together with rapp, a telomeric dna (tg( ) repeat) binding protein, is also required to initiate transcriptional silencing, or telomere position effect (tpe). here, we provide evidence for a direct role of ku in tpe, which is most likely to be in either the recruitment or activation of sir protein at the telomere. surprisingly, however, the essential role of ku in tpe is to overcome the inhibitory effect of two rapp interacting proteins, rifp and rifp, both of which also play an important role in telomere length regulation [] []. previous studies showed that rif and sir proteins compete for binding to the carboxyl terminus of rapp [] [] []. in the absence of this competition, for example, when rif genes are mutated, ku is no longer necessary for tpe, whereas the rapp carboxyl terminus is still absolutely required. we show that rifp is localized to telomeres, indicating that its inhibitory effect on tpe is direct. our data implicate a role for ku in the competition between sir and rif proteins for access to the telomeric array of rapp molecules, which results in a balance between telomeric silencing and telomere length control.
