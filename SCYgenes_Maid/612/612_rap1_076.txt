mutation of yeast ku genes disrupts the subnuclear organization of telomeres.. . the mammalian ku and ku proteins form a heterodimer that binds to the ends of double stranded dna in vitro and is required for repair of radiation induced strand breaks and v(d)j recombination [,]. deletion of the saccharomyces cerevisiae genes hdf and hdf encoding ykup and ykup, respectively enhances radiation sensitivity in a rad background [,]. in addition to repair defects, the length of the tg rich repeat on yeast telomere ends shortens dramatically [,]. we have shown previously that in yeast interphase nuclei, telomeres are clustered in a limited number of foci near the nuclear periphery [], but the elements that mediate this localization remained unknown. we report here that deletion of the genes encoding ykup or its partner ykup altered the positioning of telomeric dna in the yeast nucleus. these are the first mutants shown to affect the subnuclear localization of telomeres. strains deficient for either ykup or ykup lost telomeric silencing, although they maintained repression at the silent mating type loci. in addition, the telomere associated silencing factors sirp and sirp and the tg repeat binding protein rapp lost their punctate pattern of staining and became dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm. our results implicate the yeast ku proteins directly in aspects of telomere organization, which in turn affects the repression of telomere proximal genes.
