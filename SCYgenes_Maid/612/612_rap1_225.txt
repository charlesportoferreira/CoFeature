characterisation of the dna binding domain of the yeast rap protein.. . the amino acid yeast rap protein interacts with dna to regulate gene expression at numerous unrelated loci in the yeast genome. by a combination of amino, carboxy and internal deletions, we have defined an internal amino acid fragment of the yeast rap protein that can bind efficiently to the rap binding site of the pgk upstream activation sequence (uas). this domain spans residues to of the full length protein and lacks any homology to the dna binding 'zinc finger' or 'helix turn helix' structural motifs. all the rap binding sites we have tested bind domain , arguing that rap binds all its chromosomal sites via this domain. the domain could not be further reduced in size suggesting that it represents the minimal functional dna binding domain. the relevance of potential regions of secondary structure within the minimal binding domain is discussed.
