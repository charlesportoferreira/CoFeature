hbv c promoter sp binding sequence functionally substitutes for the yeast ars abf binding site.. . transcriptional factors have been implicated in eukaryotic dna replication. we have studied the potential function of a viral promoter sequence in dna replication. the hepatitis b virus (hbv) pregenomic promoter is regulated by two enhancers and cis elements. the g c rich region between nt, which contains two sp binding sites, is necessary for transcription origin and hbv replication. we found that the abf binding b element in yeast ars can be functionally replaced by the viral sp binding dna sequence, which activates transcription from the hbv c promoter. further, yeast rap bound to the viral sp binding sites in vitro. these results suggest that rap binds to the sp binding sites and stimulates yeast dna replication.
