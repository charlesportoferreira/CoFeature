maximal stimulation of meiotic recombination by a yeast transcription factor requires the transcription activation domain and a dna binding domain.. . the dna sequences located upstream of the yeast his represent a very strong meiotic recombination hotspot. although the activity of this hotspot requires the transcription activator rapp, the level of his transcription is not directly related to the level of recombination. we find that the recombination stimulating activity of rapp requires the transcription activation domain of the protein. we show that a hybrid protein with the galp dna binding domain and the rapp activation domain can stimulate recombination in a strain in which galp binding sites are inserted upstream of his. in addition, we find recombination hotspot activity associated with the galp dna binding sites that is independent of known transcription factors. we suggest that yeast cells have two types of recombination hotspots, alpha (transcription factor dependent) and beta (transcription factor independent).
