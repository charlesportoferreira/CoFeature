repression of rrna synthesis due to a secretory defect requires the c terminal silencing domain of rapp in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . a secretory defect causes specific transcriptional repression of both ribosomal protein and ribosomal rna genes, suggesting the coupling of plasma membrane and ribosome syntheses. we previously reported that the rap allele, which produced c terminally truncated rapp, derepressed transcription of ribosomal protein genes when the secretory pathway was blocked. in this paper, we demonstrate that the rap mutation also leads to significant attenuation of transcriptional repression of rrna genes due to a secretory defect. in contrast, the rap temperature sensitive allele containing a unique missense mutation in the middle of the coding sequence has only a weak effect on repression. these results suggest that the c terminal silencing domain of rapp is required for transcriptional repression of rdna in response to a secretory defect. we also demonstrated that transcriptional regulation of ribosomal protein genes in response to nitrogen limitation was not affected by the rap allele, suggesting that the mechanism of nitrogen response is distinct from that of the secretory response.
