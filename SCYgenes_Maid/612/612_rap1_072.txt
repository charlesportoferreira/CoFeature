rap protein regulates telomere turnover in yeast.. . telomere length is maintained through a dynamic balance between addition and loss of the terminal telomeric dna. normal telomere length regulation requires telomerase as well as a telomeric protein dna complex. previous work has provided evidence that in the budding yeasts kluyveromyces lactis and saccharomyces cerevisiae, the telomeric double stranded dna binding protein rapp negatively regulates telomere length, in part by nucleating, by its c terminal tail, a higher order dna binding protein complex that presumably limits access of telomerase to the chromosome end. here we show that in k. lactis, truncating the rapp c terminal tail (rapp deltac mutant) accelerates telomeric repeat turnover in the distal region of the telomere. in addition, combining the rap deltac mutation with a telomerase template mutation (ter kpn), which directs the addition of mutated telomeric dna repeats to telomeres, synergistically caused an immediate loss of telomere length regulation. capping of the unregulated telomeres of these double mutants with functionally wild type repeats restored telomere length control. we propose that the rate of terminal telomere turnover is controlled by rapp specifically through its interactions with the most distal telomeric repeats.
