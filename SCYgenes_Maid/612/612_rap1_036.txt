sprap and sprif, recruited to telomeres by taz, are essential for telomere function in fission yeast.. . telomeres are essential for genome integrity. scrap (s. cerevisiae rap) directly binds to telomeric dna and regulates telomere length and telomere position effect (tpe) by recruiting two different groups of proteins to its rct (rap c terminal) domain. the first group, rif and rif, regulates telomere length. the second group, sir and sir, is involved in heterochromatin formation. on the other hand, human trf and trf, as well as their fission yeast homolog, taz, directly bind to telomeric dna and negatively regulate telomere length. taz also plays important roles in tpe and meiosis. human rap, the ortholog of scrap, negatively regulates telomere length and appears to be recruited to telomeres by interacting with trf. here, we describe two novel fission yeast proteins, sprap (s. pombe rap) and sprif (s. pombe rif), which are orthologous to scrap and scrif, respectively. sprap and sprif are independently recruited to telomeres by interacting with taz. the rap mutant is severely defective in telomere length control, tpe, and telomere clustering toward the spindle pole body (spb) at the premeiotic horsetail stage, indicating that sprap has critical roles in these telomere functions. the rif mutant also shows some defects in telomere length control and meiosis. our results indicate that taz provides binding sites for telomere regulators, sprap and sprif, which perform the essential telomere functions. this study establishes the similarity of telomere organization in fission yeast and humans.
