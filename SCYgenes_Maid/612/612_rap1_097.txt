recognition of telomeric dna.. . the three dimensional structure of the yeast telomere binding protein rap in complex with dna provides the first insight into telomeric dna recognition. rap binds to dna via two myb/homeodomain like motifs, which are dna binding folds previously identified in transcription factors. this, together with the finding that human trf and other telomere binding factors contain myb like motifs, has led us to speculate that a conserved protein fold might be used for telomeric dna recognition.
