sir and sir proteins are required for the positioning and integrity of yeast telomeres.. . heritable inactivation of genes occurs in specific chromosomal domains located at the silent mating type loci and at telomeres of s. cerevisiae. the sir genes (for silent information regulators) are trans acting factors required for this repression mechanism. we show here that the sir and sir gene products have a sub nuclear localization similar to the telomere associated rap protein, which is found primarily in foci at the nuclear periphery of fixed yeast spheroplasts. in strains deficient for either sir or sir, telomeres lose their perinuclear localization, as monitored by rap immunofluorescence. the length of the telomeric repeat shortens in sir and sir mutant strains, and the mitotic stability of chromosome v is reduced. these data suggest that sir and sir are required for both the integrity and subnuclear localization of yeast telomeres, the loss of which correlates with loss of telomere associated gene repression.
