alternative mechanisms of transcriptional activation by rapp.. . single rapp dna binding sites are poor activators of transcription of yeast minimal promoters, even when fully occupied in vivo. this low efficiency is due to two independent repression mechanisms as follows. one that requires the presence of histones, and one that requires hrsp, a component of the rna polymerase ii mediator complex. both repression mechanisms were greatly reduced for constructs with tandemly arranged sites. in these constructs, uasrpg sequences (acacccatacattt) activated better than telomere like sequences (acacccacacaccc) in an orientation dependent manner. both mutations in the swi/snf complex and a deletion of amino acids of rapp (tox domain) decreased synergistic effects of contiguous telomeric sites. conversely, deletion of amino acids of rapp (sil domain) made uasrpg and telomeric sites functionally indistinguishable. we propose that the sil domain masks the main transactivation domain of rapp in rapp telomere complexes, where the tox domain behaves as a secondary activation domain, probably by interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes. rapp dna binding sites in ribosomal protein gene promoters are mainly uasrpg like; their replacement by telomeric sequences in one of these promoters (rpsb) decreased transcription by two thirds. the functional differences between uasrpgs and telomeric sequences may thus contribute to the differential expression of rapp regulated promoters in vivo.
