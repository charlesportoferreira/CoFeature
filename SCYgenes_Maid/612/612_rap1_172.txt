role of saccharomyces cerevisiae rap protein in ty and ty mediated transcription.. . binding sites for the transcription factor rap are widespread in the yeast genome. with respect to many, but not all, genes, rapp has an apparent activation function. whether rap is itself a transcriptional activator, or whether it is in some way required for activation by additional factors, is not clear. we have identified a previously unrecognized rapp binding site in the internal regulatory region of ty elements. we demonstrate that this site is capable of binding rap in vitro and that, in vivo, rapp plays an important regulatory role in ty and ty mediated adjacent gene expression. our data suggest that in ty elements, maximal levels of rap mediated activation depend on the formation of a complex with mcm, an independent dna binding protein that functions in transcription as well as in dna replication, and with a third factor, ibf, previously identified as a binding activity with a site situated between the rapp and mcmp binding sites in this region of ty elements.
