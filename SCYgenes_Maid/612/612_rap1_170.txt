tel+cen antagonism on plasmids involves telomere repeat sequences tracts and gene products that interact with chromosomal telomeres.. . in saccharomyces cerevisiae, circular plasmids that include either a centromere (cen plasmids) or a telomere sequence (tel plasmids) segregate more efficiently than circular ars plasmids. in contrast, circular plasmids that include both telomere and centromere sequences were unstable, a property we term tel+cen antagonism. tel+cen antagonism required a telomere repeat tract longer than bp although the distance and relative orientation of the centromere and telomere sequences was not critical. tel+cen antagonism was alleviated in strains carrying different rap alleles including rapts, raps, and rapt alleles. mutations sir, sir, sir, nat and ard, genes that influence transcriptional silencing at telomeres and at the silent mating type loci, abolished tel+cen antagonism mutation of sir also partially alleviated tel cen antagonism. in some sir mutant strains short yeast artificial chromosomes (yacs), which are normally unstable, became more stable, suggesting that the same mechanism that caused tel+cen antagonism on circular plasmids may contribute to the instability of short linear plasmids.
