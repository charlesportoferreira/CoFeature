cyclic amp signaling is required for function of the n terminal and cr domains of adenovirus ea in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . we have constructed yeast vectors in which derivatives of the adenovirus ea gene are expressed from the gal promoter. cells expressing ea grow poorly and accumulate cells with a c dna content. using a series of ea deletion mutants, we have identified three regions within the ea protein that are necessary for the g growth phenotype; each deletion partially relieves the growth defect. these deletions span residues , and , which fall within the n terminal, cr and cr domains of ea respectively. expression of the first residues of ea, spanning just the n terminal and cr domains, strongly inhibits yeast cell growth in g showing that these domains can function independently of other domains of ea. using this strong growth inhibition, we isolated a yeast mutant in the net gene that conferred resistance to the expression of ea . the mutant was insensitive to expression of both ea and full length ea, but remained sensitive to the toxicity caused by over expression of a galp vp fusion. finally, we found that the function of ea in yeast depends on the cyclic amp signaling pathway, providing a striking parallel with the action of ea at the c fos promoter in mammalian cells. these results suggest that a genetic analysis of the yeast model system will provide relevant new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation by ea proteins.
