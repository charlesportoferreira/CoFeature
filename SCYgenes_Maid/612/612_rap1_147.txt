rap stimulates single to double strand association of yeast telomeric dna. implications for telomere telomere interactions.. . repressor activator protein (rap) of saccharomyces cerevisiae is an abundant nuclear protein implicated in telomere length maintenance, transactivation, and in the establishment of silent chromatin domains. the rap binding site ' of the yeast his gene is also a region of hyperrecombination in meiosis. we report here that as rap binds its recognition consensus, it appears to untwist double stranded dna, which we detect as the introduction of a negative supercoil in circularization assays. coincident with the rap dependent untwisting, we observe stimulation of the association of a single stranded yeast telomeric sequence with its homologous double stranded sequence in a supercoiled plasmid. this unusual distortion of the dna double helix by rap may contribute to the rap dependent enhancement of recombination rates and promote non duplex strand interactions at telomeres.
