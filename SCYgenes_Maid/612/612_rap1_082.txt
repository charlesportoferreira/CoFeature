sir and silencer independent disruption of silencing in saccharomyces by sasp.. . a promoter fusion library of saccharomyces cerevisiae genes was used to exploit phenotypes associated with altered protein dosage. we identified a novel gene, sas, by the ability of sasp, when overproduced, to disrupt silencing. the predicted sasp was , kd and strikingly rich in charged amino acids. sasp was exclusively nuclear in all stages of the cell cycle. overproduction of sasp caused derepression of mating type genes at both hml and hmr, as well as of ura, trp, and ade when inserted near a telomere or at hmr or the rdna locus. repressed genes not associated with silenced chromatin were unaffected. sasp was essential for viability, and the termination point following sasp depletion was as large budded cells. remarkably, sasp overproduction disrupted silencing even under conditions that bypassed the requirement for sir proteins, orc, and rapp in silencing. these data implied that sasp function was intimately connected with the structure of silenced chromatin.
