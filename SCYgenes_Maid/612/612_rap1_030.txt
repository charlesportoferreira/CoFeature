telomere binding of the rap protein is required for meiosis in fission yeast.. . telomeres are essential for chromosome integrity, protecting the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes during cell proliferation. telomeres also function in meiosis; a characteristic clustering of telomeres beneath the nuclear membrane is observed during meiotic prophase in many organisms from yeasts to plants and humans, and the role of the telomeres in meiotic pairing and the recombination of homologous chromosomes has been demonstrated in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe and in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. here we report that s. pombe rap is a telomeric protein essential for meiosis. while rap is conserved in budding yeast and humans, schemes for telomere binding vary among species. human rap binds to the telomere through interaction with the telomere binding protein trf; s. cerevisiae rap, however, binds telomeric dna directly, and no orthologs of trf proteins have been identified in this organism. in s. pombe, unlike in s. cerevisiae, an ortholog of human trf has been identified. this ortholog, taz, binds directly to telomere repeats [] and is necessary for telomere clustering in meiotic prophase. our results demonstrate that s. pombe rap binds to telomeres through interaction with taz, similar to human rap trf, and that taz mediated telomere localization of rap is necessary for telomere clustering and for the successful completion of meiosis. moreover, in taz disrupted cells, molecular fusion of rap with the taz dna binding domain recovers telomere clustering and largely complements defects in meiosis, indicating that telomere localization of rap is a key requirement for meiosis.
