relocalization of telomeric ku and sir proteins in response to dna strand breaks in yeast.. . telomeric tg rich repeats and their associated proteins protect the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes from end to end fusions. associated with the cap structure at yeast telomeres is a subtelomeric domain of heterochromatin, containing the silent information regulator (sir) complex. the ku/ heterodimer (yku) is associated both with the chromosome end and with subtelomeric chromatin. surprisingly, both yku and the chromatin associated rap and sir proteins are released from telomeres in a rad dependent response to dna damage. yku is recruited rapidly to double strand cuts, while low levels of sir proteins are detected near cleavage sites at later time points. consistently, yku or sir deficient strains are hypersensitive to dna damaging agents. the release of yku from telomeric chromatin may allow efficient scanning of the genome for dna strand breaks.
