promoter specific binding of rap revealed by genome wide maps of protein dna association.. . we determined the distribution of repressor activator protein (rap) and the accessory silencing proteins sir, sir and sir in vivo on the entire yeast genome, at a resolution of kb. rap is central to the cellular economy during rapid growth, targeting loci, about % of yeast genes, and participating in the activation of % of all rna polymerase ii initiation events in exponentially growing cells. although the dna sequence recognized by rap is found in both coding and intergenic sequences, the binding of rap to the genome was highly specific to intergenic regions with the potential to act as promoters. this global phenomenon, which may be a general characteristic of sequence specific transcriptional factors, indicates the existence of a genome wide molecular mechanism for marking promoter regions.
