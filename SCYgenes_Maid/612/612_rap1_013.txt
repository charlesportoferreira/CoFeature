the tor pathway regulates gene expression by linking nutrient sensing to histone acetylation.. . the tor pathway mediates cell growth in response to nutrient availability, in part by inducing ribosomal protein (rp) gene expression via an unknown mechanism. expression of rp genes coincides with recruitment of the esa histone acetylase to rp gene promoters. we show that inhibition of tor with rapamycin releases esa from rp gene promoters and leads to histone h deacetylation without affecting promoter occupancy by rap and abf. genetic and biochemical evidence identifies rpd as the major histone deacetylase responsible for reversing histone h acetylation at rp gene promoters in response to tor inhibition by rapamycin or nutrient limitation. our results illustrate that the tor pathway links nutrient sensing with histone acetylation to control rp gene expression and cell growth.
