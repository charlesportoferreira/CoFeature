dna binding and telomere length regulation of yeast rap homologues.. . the repressor activator protein (rap) has many important functions in saccharomyces cerevisiae. at the chromosome ends, it is a negative regulator of telomere length. here, we show that saccharomyces castellii/saccharomyces dairensis telomeric sequences inserted into a s.cerevisiae telomere are counted as part of the telomere, consistent with the presence of high affinity rapp binding sites within these sequences. we show that s.castellii rapp (scasrapp) can regulate telomere length in a s.cerevisiae strain, albeit less stringently. cloning of the s.dairensis rap homologue (sdairap) revealed that it encodes the largest rap protein identified to date. despite its large size, binding analyses of the recombinant sdairapp revealed that the protein binds with the same spacing and with similar affinity to yeast telomeric sequences, as the scer and scasrap proteins. according to the rapp counting model for telomere length regulation, a low density of rapp binding sites in a telomere would result in a longer telomere in s.cerevisiae. we have compared the lengths of two individual s.dairensis telomeres and find that their lengths are not regulated to give the same number of high affinity binding sites. this may be due to other factors than rapp having influence on the telomere length regulation.
