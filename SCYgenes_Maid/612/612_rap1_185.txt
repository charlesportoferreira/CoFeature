distortion of the dna double helix by rap at silencers and multiple telomeric binding sites.. . repressor activator protein (rap) is an essential nuclear protein of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae that recognizes a base pair (bp) consensus sequence found in numerous upstream activating sequences, at the silencers of transcriptionally repressed mating type genes, and in telomeric tracts, called (c a) repeats. rap has been shown to influence transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, telomere length, circular plasmid segregation and meiotic recombination in vivo. we have studied the structure of the protein dna complex reconstituted in vitro with highly purified rap, by using dnase i and chemical footprinting. both full length rap and its minimal dna binding domain of roughly kda, induce a distortion within the bp recognition site, as demonstrated by reactivity to kmno primarily at nucleotides and in the binding consensus rc/aayccryncayy. dimethylsulphate reactivity shows that rap binding does not create unpaired regions at its binding site, although the dna may be locally underwound or aberrantly base paired at the permanganate reactive nucleotides. in addition to the permanganate sensitive distortion, the full length rap, but not its dna binding domain, induces a bend in dna ' of the recognition sequence, altering the electrophoretic mobility of the protein dna complex. the kmno reactivity has allowed a precise mapping of rap molecules on telomeric dna, revealing rap sites as frequently as one per bp of telomeric dna, or potentially rap molecules bound per average telomeric tract of bp. this suggests that rap plays a major role in organizing yeast telomeres, and is consistent with recently published immunofluorescence studies showing a major fraction of rap at the ends of meiotic chromosomes.
