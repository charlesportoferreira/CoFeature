rap protein activates and silences transcription of mating type genes in yeast.. . rap is a sequence specific dna binding protein essential for cell growth. the occurrence of rap binding sites in many promoter regions, the mating type gene silencer elements, and telomeres suggests that rap has multiple functions in the cell. to assess its role in transcription, temperature sensitive mutations in rap were generated. analysis of rapts strains provides evidence that rap functions in both transcriptional activation and silencing of mating type genes. several observations indicate that rapts strains are defective in the expression of mat alpha, whose upstream activation sequence (uas) contains a rap binding site. at nonpermissive temperatures, decreases in mat alpha steady state transcript levels can be detected in mat alpha rapts strains. furthermore, these strains are deficient in alpha pheromone production and simultaneously express at least two alpha specific genes. these phenotypes can be reversed by replacing the rap binding site at mat alpha with a binding site for the gal transcriptional activator. certain rapts alleles have an opposite effect on the silent mating type locus hmr, which becomes partially derepressed at nonpermissive temperatures.
