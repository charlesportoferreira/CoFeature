structural and functional heterogeneity of rapp complexes with telomeric and uasrpg like dna sequences.. . rapp binds to a variety of related dna sequences. we studied complexes of rapp and its dna binding domain with two of these sequences, the uasrpg sequence (' acacccatacattt ') and the saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeric consensus (' acacccacacaccc '). when cloned in front of a minimal cyc promoter, the two sequences differed in their transcriptional potential. whereas uasrpg or telomeric single binding sites activated transcription with approximately the same strength, adjacent uasrpg sequences showed higher synergistic activity and orientation dependence than telomeric sequences. we also found different sequence requirements for rapp binding in vitro to both sequences, since a single base pair that severely reduced binding of rapp to uasrpg sequences had very little effect on the telomeric sequence. the rapp binding domain distorted dna molecules encompassing the uasrpg sequence or the telomeric like sequence, as revealed by both kmno hypersensitivity and by hydroxyl radical foot printing analysis. we propose that rapp is able to form structurally and functionally different complexes, depending on the type of dna sequence the complex is assembled from. this functional and structural heterogeneity may be responsible for the multiple functions that rapp binding sites appear to have in vivo. copyright academic press.
