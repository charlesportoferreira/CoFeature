nuclear organization and silencing. trafficking of sir proteins.. . in budding yeast genes integrated near telomeres succumb to a variegated pattern of gene repression that requires the silent information regulatory proteins sirp, sirp and sirp, which form a nucleosome binding complex. immunolocalization shows that the sir proteins co localize with the telomeric repeat binding protein rapp and with telomeric dna in a limited number of foci near the periphery of interphase nuclei. all conditions tested so far that disrupt telomere proximal repression result in a dispersed staining pattern for sirp, sirp and sirp. although the focal organization is clearly not sufficient for establishing repression, genetic studies suggest that the high local concentration of sir proteins at telomeric foci facilitates the formation of repressed chromatin. in addition to its telomeric localization, sirp is shown by immunostaining and cross linking to bind a subdomain of the nucleolus. in strains lacking an intact sirp, sirp also becomes concentrated in the nucleolus by a pathway requiring sir and uth. this unexpected localization correlates with observed effects of sir mutations on rdna stability and longevity, defining a new site of action for silent information regulatory factors. we report a novel wd repeat containing factor, sifp, that binds specifically to the sirp n terminus. like sirp and uthp, sifp antagonizes telomeric silencing by regulating an equilibrium between alternative assembly pathways at different subnuclear loci.
