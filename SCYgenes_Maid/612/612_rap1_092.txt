localization of sirp. the nucleolus as a compartment for silent information regulators.. . in wild type budding yeast strains, the proteins encoded by sir, sir and rap co localize with telomeric dna in a limited number of foci in interphase nuclei. immunostaining of sirp shows that in addition to a punctate staining that coincides with rap foci, sirp localizes to a subdomain of the nucleolus. the presence of sirp at both the spacer of the rdna repeat and at telomeres is confirmed by formaldehyde cross linking and immunoprecipitation with anti sirp antibodies. in strains lacking sirp, sirp becomes concentrated in the nucleolus, by a pathway requiring sir and uth, a gene that regulates life span in yeast. the unexpected nucleolar localization of sirp and sirp correlates with observed effects of sir mutations on rdna stability and yeast longevity, defining a new site of action for silent information regulatory factors.
