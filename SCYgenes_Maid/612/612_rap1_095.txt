the general regulatory factor rebp controls basal, but not galp mediated, transcription of the gcy gene in yeast.. . expression of the gene gcy in saccharomyces cerevisiae is induced by about fold in the presence of galactose as a result of activation by galp. in contrast to other galp regulated genes, such as gal or gal, gcy is transcribed at a relatively high basal level. we have analysed the basis of this behaviour and have found that, in addition to a uasgal, a binding site for the general regulatory factor rebp is localized bp upstream of the tata sequence and about bp ' to the uasgal. rebp binds to this site with low affinity. rebp, an abundant, multifunctional dna binding protein in yeast, acts as a weak transcriptional activator in the control regions of several genes encoding unrelated functions. the action of rebp is assumed to be strongly position dependent. in the control region of gcy. rebp acts independently of position and stimulates basal expression of gcy about threefold, whereas galp mediated activation is not influenced significantly. promoter proximal insertion of an additional rebp recognition site enhances basal transcription only marginally, but can largely compensate for deletion of the natural rebp binding site. either an abfp or a rapp binding site can substitute for the rebp recognition sequence, indicating that these general regulatory factors fulfill related functions in basal transcription, without affecting galp mediated activation. in addition to rebp, the sequence of the galp binding site influences basal transcription. this effect is independent of the gal protein, as it operates in a gal mutant background as well. this finding suggests that the nucleotide sequence of the uasgal in the gcy promoter has intrinsic properties, presumably a particular dna structure, that influence basal transcription and act synergistically with rebp.
