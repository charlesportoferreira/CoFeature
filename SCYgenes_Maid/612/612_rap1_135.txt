the sequence of a . kb dna segment from the left arm of yeast chromosome xiv reveals mer; rap; a new putative member of the dna replication complex and a new putative serine/threonine phosphatase gene.. . the nucleotide sequence of two adjacent clai fragments from the left arm of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome xiv has been determined. analysis of the , bp dna segment reveals nine open reading frames (orfs) longer than bp. n contains the consensus sequence for a phosphate binding loop common to atp and gtp binding proteins and a strictly conserved 'src' sequence of unknown function present in all accessory proteins of replicative polymerases. n shares homologies with serine/threonine phosphatases. n encodes rap (tuf or sbf e), a transcription regulator. n is the mer gene required for chromosome pairing and genetic recombination. two orfs show no homology with proteins in the databases and no particular features. n is not likely to be expressed as it is located on the complementary strand of n.
