highly conserved toxicity of saccharomyces cerevisiae rapp.. . budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) rapp has been expressed in fission yeast (schizosaccharomyces pombe) under the control of the regulatable fructose bisphosphatase (fbp) promoter. when the fbp promoter was derepressed, cells containing the complete rap gene failed to show any significant growth, suggesting that rapp is toxic. a derivative of rapp that has a temperature sensitive mutation in the dna binding domain was not toxic in cells grown at degrees c, a temperature at which dna binding by rapp(ts) is severely inhibited. removal of a short region downstream of the dna binding domain, including a region previously shown to be essential for rapp toxicity in budding yeast, also abolished the toxic effect. the toxic effect of rapp has therefore been conserved between two distantly related yeasts. in budding yeast, overexpression of rapp also caused changes to the lengths of the telomeric repeats. no effects on telomeres were detected in fission yeast.
