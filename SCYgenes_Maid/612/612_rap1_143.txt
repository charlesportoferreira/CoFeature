histone h and h n termini interact with sir and sir proteins. a molecular model for the formation of heterochromatin in yeast.. . the silent mating loci and chromosomal regions adjacent to telomeres of s. cerevisiae have features similar to heterochromatin of more complex eukaryotes. transcriptional repression at these sites depends on the silent information regulators sir and sir as well as histones h and h. we show here that the sir and sir proteins interact with specific silencing domains of the h and h n termini in vitro. certain mutations in these factors, which affect their silencing functions in vivo, also disrupt their interactions in vitro. immunofluorescence studies with antibodies against rap and sir demonstrate that the h and h n termini are required for the association of sir with telomeric chromatin and the perinuclear positioning of yeast telomeres. based on these interactions, we propose a model for heterochromatin mediated transcriptional silencing in yeast, which may serve as a paradigm for other eukaryotic organisms as well.
