identification of human rap. implications for telomere evolution.. . it has been puzzling that mammalian telomeric proteins, including trf, trf, tankyrase, and tin have no recognized orthologs in budding yeast. here, we describe a human protein, hrap, that is an ortholog of the yeast telomeric protein, scrapp. hrap has three conserved sequence motifs in common with scrap, is located at telomeres, and affects telomere length. however, while scrap binds telomeric dna directly, hrap is recruited to telomeres by trf. extending the comparison of telomeric proteins to fission yeast, we identify s. pombe taz as a trf ortholog, indicating that trfs are conserved at eukaryotic telomeres. the data suggest that ancestral telomeres, like those of vertebrates, contained a trf like protein as well as rap. we propose that budding yeast preserved rap at telomeres but lost the trf component, possibly concomitant with a change in the telomeric repeat sequence.
