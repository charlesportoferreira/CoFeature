isolation and characterization of candida albicans homologue of rap, a repressor and activator protein gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . to study the function of rap, a candida albicans gene (carap) that shows sequence similarity to rap of saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated by colony hybridization. dna sequencing predicted an open reading frame of amino acids with an overall identity of % to the scrapp. the dna binding domain (dbd) was highly conserved, and emsa using a gst carapp fusion protein confirmed its binding ability to the rpg box of s. cerevisiae eno. in contrast, the n terminus was less conserved and a moderate homology was observed in the brct domain. interestingly, carapp did not contain the c terminal activation/repression region of scrapp. copyright john wiley &amp; sons, ltd.
