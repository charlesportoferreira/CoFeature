a class of single stranded telomeric dna binding proteins required for rapp localization in yeast nuclei.. . we have identified a class of proteins that bind single stranded telomeric dna and are required for the nuclear organization of telomeres and/or telomere associated proteins. rlfp was identified by its sequence similarity to gbpp, a single stranded telomeric dna binding protein from chlamydomonas reinhardtii. rlfp and gbpp bind yeast single stranded g strand telomeric dna. both proteins include at least two rna recognition motifs, which are found in many proteins that interact with single stranded nucleic acids. disruption of rlf alters the distribution of repressor/activator protein (rapp), a telomere associated protein. in wild type yeast cells, rapp localizes to a small number of perinuclear spots, while in rlf cells rapp appears diffuse and nuclear. interestingly, telomere position effect and telomere length control, which require rap, are unaffected by rlf mutations, demonstrating that rapp localization can be uncoupled from other rapp dependent telomere functions. in addition, expression of chlamydomonas gbp restores perinuclear, punctate rapp localization in rlf mutant cells. the functional complementation of a fungal gene by an algal gene suggests that rlfp and gbpp are members of a conserved class of single stranded telomeric dna binding proteins that influence nuclear organization. furthermore, it demonstrates that, despite their unusual codon bias, c. reinhardtii genes can be efficiently translated in saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.
