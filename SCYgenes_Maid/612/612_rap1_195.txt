isolation and sequence analysis of the gene encoding translation elongation factor from candida albicans.. . the structural gene encoding translation elongation factor (ef ) has been cloned from a candida albicans genomic library by hybridization to a saccharomyces cerevisiae probe containing the saccharomyces gene, yef (sandbaken et al., b). the sequences were shown to be functionally homologous to the saccharomyces gene by three criteria. () a saccharomyces strain transformed with a high copy plasmid containing caef sequences overproduces the ef peptide two fold; () extracts from this strain exhibit a two fold increase in the ef catalysed, ribosome dependent atpase activity (kamath and chakraburtty, ); and () the candida gene complements a saccharomyces null mutant. the coding region, identified by dna sequencing, indicates that caef encodes a amino acid polypeptide having a potential molecular weight of , da. this protein shows % overall identity to the saccharomyces yef gene, with a significantly greater identity (%) concentrated in the region of the protein thought to contain the catalytic domain of ef (sandbaken et al., a). the upstream non coding region contains t rich regions typical of many yeast genes and several potential rap/grf elements shown to regulate expression of a number of translational genes (mager, ). the data confirm a high degree of conservation for ef among the two organisms.
