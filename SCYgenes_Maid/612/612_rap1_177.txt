saccharomyces cerevisiae multifunctional protein rap binds to a conserved sequence in the polyoma virus enhancer and is responsible for its transcriptional activity in yeast cells.. . the polyoma virus enhancer (a + b domain) activates transcription in saccharomyces cerevisiae when joined to appropriate yeast promoter elements. we demonstrate by dnase i footprints and inhibition of binding by specific antibody, that the yeast protein rap binds to the b domain of the polyoma enhancer and, at least in some promoter contexts, is responsible for transcriptional activity of the enhancer b domain in yeast. close matches to a consensus rap binding site are also present in other viral enhancers.
