sir and sir interactions differ in core and extended telomeric heterochromatin in yeast.. . yeast core telomeric heterochromatin can silence adjacent genes and requires rap, sir, sir, and sir and histones h and h for this telomere position effect. sir overproduction can extend the silenced domain. we examine here the nature of these multiprotein complexes. sir and sir were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts. in addition, using formaldehyde cross linking we have mapped sir, sir, and rap along telomeric chromatin before and after sir overexpression. our data demonstrate that sir and sir interact in a protein complex and that sir, sir, sir, and rap map to the same sites along telomeric heterochromatin in wild type cells. however, when overexpressed, sir spreads along the chromosome and its interactions are dominant to those of sir and especially sir, whose detection is decreased in extended heterochromatin. rap binding at the core region is unaffected by sir overproduction and rap shows no evidence of spreading. thus, we propose that the structure of core telomeric heterochromatin differs from that extended by sir.
