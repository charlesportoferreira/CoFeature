isolation and functional analysis of a kluyveromyces lactis rap homologue.. . saccharomyces cerevisiae rap (sc rap) is an essential protein which interacts with diverse genetic loci within the cell. rap binds site specifically to the consensus sequence, ' aycyrtrcayyw (uasrpg, where r = a or g, w = a or t, y = c or t). in kluyveromyces lactis (kl) ribosomal protein encoding genes (rp) retain functional rap binding elements, suggesting the presence of a rap like factor. kl extracts display an activity capable of specifically binding to rp fragments bearing uasrpg. we subsequently isolated the kl rap encoding gene by homology to a subfragment which encodes the n terminus of the dna binding domain of sc rap. the predicted amino acid (aa) sequence of kl rap indicates it is smaller than sc rap ( vs. aa) with the n terminus being truncated. the dna binding domain is virtually identical between the two rap proteins, while the rif domain is moderately conserved. the region between these two domains and the n termini are highly divergent. two potential uasrpg were identified in the ' flanking region, suggesting an autoregulatory role for rap. despite the similarities between the two proteins, ki rap is unable to complement sc rapts mutants, suggesting that domains essential for function in sc are absent from the kl protein.
