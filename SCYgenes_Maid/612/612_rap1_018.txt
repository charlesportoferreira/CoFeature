a role for the saccharomyces cerevisiae rent complex protein net in hmr silencing.. . silencing in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is known in three classes of loci. in the silent mating type loci hml and hmr, in subtelomeric regions, and in the highly repetitive rdna locus, which resides in the nucleolus. rdna silencing differs markedly from the other two classes of silencing in that it requires a dna associated protein complex termed rent. the net protein, a central component of rent, is required for nucleolar integrity and the control of exit from mitosis. another rent component is the nad(+) dependent histone deacetylase sir, which is the only silencing factor known to be shared among the three classes of silencing. here, we investigated the role of net in hmr silencing. the mutation net , as well as net expression from a micro plasmid, restored repression at silencing defective hmr loci. both effects were strictly dependent on the sir proteins. we found overexpressed net protein to be directly associated with the hmr e silencer, suggesting that net could interact with silencer binding proteins and recruit other silencing factors to the silencer. in agreement with this, net provided orc dependent, sir independent silencing when artificially tethered to the silencer. in contrast, our data suggested that net acted indirectly in hmr silencing by releasing sir from the nucleolus, thus shifting the internal competition for sir from the silenced loci toward hmr.
