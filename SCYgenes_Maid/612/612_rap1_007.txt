composition and conservation of the telomeric complex.. . the telomere is composed of telomeric dna and telomere associated proteins. recently, many telomere associated proteins have been identified, and various telomere functions have been uncovered. in budding yeast, scrap binds directly to telomeric dna, and other telomere regulators (sir proteins and rif proteins) are recruited to the telomeres by interacting with scrap. cdc binds to the most distal end of the chromosome and recruits telomerase to the telomeres. in fission yeast and humans, ttaggg repeat binding factor (trf) family proteins bind directly to telomeric dna, and rap proteins and other telomere regulators are recruited to the telomeres by interacting with the trf family proteins. both organisms have pot proteins at the most distal end of the telomere instead of a budding yeast cdc like protein. therefore, fission yeast and humans have in part common telomeric compositions that differ from that of budding yeast, a result that suggests budding yeast has lost some telomere components during the course of evolution.
