the crystal structure of the dna binding domain of yeast rap in complex with telomeric dna.. . telomeres, the nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, are essential for chromosome stability. in the yeast s. cerevisiae, telomeric dna is bound in a sequence specific manner by rap, a multifunctional protein also involved in transcriptional regulation. here we report the crystal structure of the dna binding domain of rap in complex with telomeric dna site at . a resolution. the protein contains two similar domains that bind dna in a tandem orientation, recognizing a tandemly repeated dna sequence. the domains are structurally related to the homeodomain and the proto oncogene myb, but show novel features in their dna binding mode. a structured linker between the domains and a long c terminal tail contribute to the binding specificity. this structure provides insight into the recognition of the conserved telomeric dna sequences by a protein.
