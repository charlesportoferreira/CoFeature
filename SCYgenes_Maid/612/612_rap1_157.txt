a rebp binding site is required for efficient activation of the yeast rap gene, but multiple binding sites for rapp are not essential.. . the saccharomyces cerevisiae rap protein (rapp) is a key multifunctional transcription factor. using gel retardation analysis, four binding sites for rapp have been identified within the promoter of the rap gene. these sites are located downstream of a binding site for the transcription factor rebp. the rebp site and an associated at rich region are important for transcriptional activation, but deletion of three of the rapp binding sites had little effect on promoter activity. the activity of the rap promoter has been analysed in a yeast strain (yds) that contains a temperature sensitive mutation in the rap gene. this mutation renders the dna binding activity of rapp temperature dependent. when yds was grown at a semi permissive temperature ( degrees c), the activity of the rap promoter increased by approximately %, compared with the same strain grown at the permissive temperature ( degrees c). a rap promoter in which three of the four rapp binding sites had been deleted, showed only a small increase in activity in the same experiment. these data confirm that rapp is not required for activation of the rap gene, and suggest a role for rapp in negative autoregulation.
