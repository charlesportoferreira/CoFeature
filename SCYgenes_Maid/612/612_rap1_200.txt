rap is required for bas/bas and gcn dependent transcription of the yeast his gene.. . the major in vitro binding activity to the saccharomyces cerevisiae his promoter is due to the rap protein. in the absence of gcn, bas, and bas, the rap protein binds to the his promoter in vivo but cannot efficiently stimulate his transcription. rap, which binds adjacently to bas on the his promoter, is required for bas/bas dependent activation of his basal level transcription. in addition, the rap binding site overlaps with the single high affinity his gcn binding site. even though rap and gcn bind competitively in vitro, rap is required in vivo for (i) the normal steady state levels of gcn dependent his transcription under nonstarvation conditions and (ii) the rapid increase in gcn dependent steady state his mrna levels following amino acid starvation. the presence of the rap binding site in the his promoter causes a dramatic increase in the micrococcal nuclease sensitivity of two adjacent regions within his chromatin. one region contains the high affinity gcn binding site, and the other region contains the bas and bas binding sites. these results suggest that rap functions at his by increasing the accessibility of gcn, bas, and bas to their respective binding sites when these sites are present within chromatin.
