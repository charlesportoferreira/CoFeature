structural and putative regulatory sequences of kluyveromyces ribosomal protein genes.. . the transcription of the majority of the ribosomal protein (rp) genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae is activated by cis acting elements, designated rpg boxes, which specifically bind the multifunctional protein rap in vitro. to investigate to what extent this global system of transcription regulation has been conserved, we have isolated a number of rp genes of the related yeast species kluyveromyces lactis and kluyveromyces marxianus, whose counterparts in saccharomyces are controlled by rap. the coding regions of these genes showed a sequence similarity of about % when compared to their saccharomyces counterparts. in contrast, little or no sequence similarity was found between the upstream regions and the intervening sequences of kluyveromyces and saccharomyces homologs. however, the occurrence and the position of the introns is conserved. the sequence data also show that the physical linkage that exists in s. cerevisiae between the rp genes encoding rp (cry), s and l is conserved in kluyveromyces. northern analysis demonstrated that each of the isolated kluyveromyces genes is transcriptionally active. by sequence comparison we identified a number of conserved sequences in the upstream region of each of the kluyveromyces rp genes, which we designated the x, z and rpgk boxes. the last one is highly similar, though not identical, to the s. cerevisiae rpg box. functional analysis of the intergenic region between the genes encoding kluyveromyces ribosomal proteins s and l showed that the rpgk box (+z box) functions as a transcriptional activator, while the x box acts as a transcriptional repressor. band shift assays confirmed the existence of a rap like protein in kluyveromyces that binds to the rpgk box but not to the s. cerevisiae rpg box. in contrast, s. cerevisiae rap did recognize the rpgk box.
