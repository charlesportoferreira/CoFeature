chromatin opening and transactivator potentiation by rap in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . transcriptional activators function in vivo via binding sites that may be packaged into chromatin. here we show that whereas the transcriptional activator gal is strongly able to perturb chromatin structure via a nucleosomal binding site in yeast, gcn does so poorly. correspondingly, gcn requires assistance from an accessory protein, rap, for activation of the his promoter, whereas gal does not. the requirement for rap for gcn mediated his activation is dictated by the dna binding domain of gcn and not the activation domain, suggesting that rap assists gcn in gaining access to its binding site. consistent with this, overexpression of gcn partially alleviates the requirement for rap, whereas his activation via a weak gal binding site requires rap. rap is extremely effective at interfering with positioning of a nucleosome containing its binding site, consistent with a role in opening chromatin at the his promoter. furthermore, increasing the spacing between binding sites for rap and gcn by or bp does not impair his activation, indicating that cooperative protein protein interactions are not involved in transcriptional facilitation by rap. we conclude that an important role of rap is to assist activator binding by opening chromatin.
