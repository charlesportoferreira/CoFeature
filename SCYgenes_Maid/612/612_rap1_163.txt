the yeast telomere binding protein rap binds to and promotes the formation of dna quadruplexes in telomeric dna.. . the protein rap is essential for the maintenance of the telomeres of saccharomyces cerevisiae and binds in vitro to multiple sites found within the tg telomeric repeats. we show here that, in addition to its known binding activity for double stranded dna, rap binds sequence specifically to the gt strands. this indicates that rap is the protein that binds to the telomeric terminal gt tails. furthermore, we have found that rap binds to and promotes the formation of g tetrads, i.e. dna quadruplexes, in gt strand oligonucleotides at nanomolar concentrations. the formation of dna quadruplexes appears to involve the intermolecular association of gt strands. the minimal dna binding domain of rap (dbd) binds only to double stranded dna, so that the novel dna binding activity we have found involves regions of the protein located outside of the dbd. the finding that a telomeric protein promotes the formation of g tetrads argues for the use of dna quadruplexes in telomere association.
