transcription factors are required for the meiotic recombination hotspot at the his locus in saccharomyces cerevisiae.. . the full activity of a recombination initiation site located ' of his requires the binding of the transcription factors rap, bas, and bas. two rap binding sites can substitute for the wild type initiation site. a bp region of telomeric dna inserted upstream of either his or arg very strongly stimulates recombination. we suggest that the ability of transcription factors to induce recombination is a consequence of an altered chromatin structure that favors the entry of proteins that initiate recombination, rather than an effect of these factors on transcription.
