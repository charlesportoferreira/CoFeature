downstream activating sequence within the coding region of a yeast gene. specific binding in vitro of rap protein.. . using a gel retardation assay, a protein factor that specifically interacts with a bp intragenic sequence of the highly expressed and glucose inducible srp gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae has been detected. this binding site is located in a transcribed region and within the open reading frame (positions + to + relative to the first base of the initiation codon). a mutant strain carrying a deletion of this binding site showed a dramatic decrease in steady state levels of srp transcripts. this decline is not the result of a decrease in mrna stability, since expression of hybrid genes in which the srp promoter was replaced by the heterologous cyc promoter was not affected by the binding site deletion. these findings suggest that the bp sequence contains a cis acting downstream activating element which is involved in the transcriptional activation of the srp promoter. sequence comparisons showed similarities between a site located within the bp sequence and the high affinity consensus binding site of the rap/grf (also named tuf) factor and methylation interference experiments confirmed that this site was involved in the protein dna interaction. both the results of competition experiments with upstream activating sequences of ribosomal protein genes (uasrpg), which are targets for rap binding, and determination of the apparent molecular weight of the affinity purified dna binding protein indicated that rap factor recognized the srp bp element. the bp sequence was found to be unable to provide uas activity when placed upstream of the tata box and transcription start site.
