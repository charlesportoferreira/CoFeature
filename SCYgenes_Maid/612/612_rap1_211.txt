dna binding protein rap stimulates meiotic recombination at the his locus in yeast.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, as in other eukaryotes, some regions of the genome have a much higher rate of meiotic recombination than others. we show below that the binding of the rap protein to a site upstream of the his gene is necessary for a high rate of meiotic (but not mitotic) recombination at this locus. a mutation in the rap binding site at his results in a decrease in recombination; overproduction of rap causes an increase in recombination at his above wild type levels.
