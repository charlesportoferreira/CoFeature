mga and spt are modifiers of transcriptional silencing in yeast.. . transcriptional silencing at the hm loci and telomeres in yeast depends on several trans acting factors, including rapp and the sir proteins. the sum mutation was identified by its ability to restore silencing to strains deficient in one or more of these trans acting factors. the mechanism by which sum bypasses the requirement for silencing proteins is not known. we identified four loci that when reduced in dosage in diploid strains increase the ability of sum strains to suppress silencing defects. two of the genes responsible for this effect were found to be mga and spt. mgap and sptp were previously identified as functionally related transcription factors that influence chromatin structure. we find that deletion of mga or spt also increases the efficiency of silencing in haploid sum strains. these results suggest that mgap and sptp are antagonists of silencing. consistent with this proposal we find that deletion of mga or spt also suppresses the silencing defects caused by deletion of the sir gene or by mutations in the hmr silencer sequences. however, we find that mgap and sptp can positively affect silencing in other contexts; deletion of either mga or spt decreases mating in strains bearing mutations in the hml e silencer. mgap and sptp appear to be a novel class of factors that influence disparate pathways of transcriptional control by chromatin.
