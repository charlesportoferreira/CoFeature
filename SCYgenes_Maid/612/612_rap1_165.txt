enhancement of telomere plasmid segregation by the x telomere associated sequence in saccharomyces cerevisiae involves sir, sir, sir and abf.. . we have previously shown that circular replicating plasmids that carry yeast telomere repeat sequence (tg ) tracts segregate efficiently relative to analogous plasmids lacking the tg tract and this efficient segregation is dependent upon rap. while a long tg tract is sufficient to improve plasmid segregation, the segregation efficiency of telomere plasmids (tel plasmids) is enhanced when the x telomere associated sequence (x tas) is also included on the plasmids. we now demonstrate that the enhancement of tel plasmid segregation by the x tas depends on sir, sir, sir and abf in trans and requires the abfp binding site within the x tas. mutation of the abfp binding site within the x tas results in tel plasmids that are no longer affected by mutations in sir, sir or sir, despite the fact that other abfp binding sites are present on the plasmid. mutation of the ars consensus sequence within the x tas converts the x tas from an enhancer element to a negative element that interferes with tel plasmid segregation in a sir dependent manner. thus, telomere associated sequences interact with tg tracts on the plasmid, suggesting that the tass have an active role in modulating telomere function.
