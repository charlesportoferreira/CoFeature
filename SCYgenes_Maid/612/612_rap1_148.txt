use of a selection technique to identify the diversity of binding sites for the yeast rap transcription factor.. . we have used the technique known as selected and amplified binding (saab) to isolate binding sites for the yeast transcription factor rap from a degenerate pool of oligonucleotides. a total of sequences were isolated, of which two were shown to be contaminating non rap binding sites. after excluding these two sequences the remainder of the sequences were used to derive a new consensus binding site for rap. the new consensus ' a/g t a/g c a c c c a n n c c/a c c ' is a significant extension of the existing consensus (). it is longer by two base pairs at the ' end and is significantly more constrained at the ' end. an analysis of the combinations of mis matches in individual saab sequences, compared to the consensus rap binding site, has allowed us to analyse the structure of the rap binding site in some detail. the binding site can be sub divided into three regions; a core binding site, a ' flanking region and a ' flanking region. the core binding site, consisting of the sequence 'caccca', is critical for recognition by rap. the less conserved flanking regions are not as important. interactions between rap and these regions probably stabilise the interaction between rap and the core binding site. each of the sequences isolated in the saab analysis was used to search release of the embl+genbank dna data base. the searches identified potential binding sites for rap within promoters of yeast genes.
