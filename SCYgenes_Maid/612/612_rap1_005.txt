virulence related surface glycoproteins in the yeast pathogen candida glabrata are encoded in subtelomeric clusters and subject to rap and sir dependent transcriptional silencing.. . candida glabrata is an important opportunistic pathogen causing both mucosal and bloodstream infections. c. glabrata is able to adhere avidly to mammalian cells, an interaction that depends on the epap lectin. epa is shown here to be a member of a larger family of highly related genes encoded in subtelomeric clusters. subtelomeric clustering of large families of surface glycoprotein encoding genes is a hallmark of several pathogens, including plasmodium, trypanosoma, and pneumocystis. in these other pathogens, a single surface glycoprotein is expressed, whereas other genes in the family are transcriptionally silent. similarly, whereas epa is expressed in vitro, epa are transcriptionally repressed. this repression is shown to be due to regional silencing of the subtelomeric loci. in saccharomyces cerevisiae, subtelomeric silencing is initiated by rapp binding to the telomeric repeats and subsequent recruitment of the sir complex by protein protein interaction. we demonstrate here that silencing of the subtelomeric epa loci also depends on functional sirp and rapp. this identification and analysis of the epa gene family provides a compelling example in an ascomycete of chromatin based silencing of natural subtelomeric genes and provides for the first time in a pathogen, molecular insight into the transcriptional silencing of large subtelomeric gene families.
