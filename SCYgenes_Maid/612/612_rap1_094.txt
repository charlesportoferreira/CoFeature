functional analysis of a replication origin from saccharomyces cerevisiae. identification of a new replication enhancer.. . yeast replication origins have a modular arrangement of essential dna sequences containing the ars consensus sequence (acs) flanked by auxiliary dna elements which stimulate origin function. one of the auxiliary elements identified at several origins is a dna replication enhancer that binds the abfp protein. we have isolated an ars sequence from saccharomyces cerevisiae based on its ability to bind abfp. here we present a detailed molecular dissection of this ars, designated ars , and we demonstrate that it functions as a genomic replication origin on chromosome xv . mutagenesis of the abfp dna binding sites revealed that these sequences did not contribute significantly to ars function. instead, a new dna element important for replication, designated ren, has been located ' to the t rich strand of the acs. we show that ren functions in either orientation and at variable distances from the acs, defining this element as a dna replication enhancer. most significantly, point mutations within this element decreased the stability of plasmids bearing ars , suggesting that ren binds a protein important for replication initiation. only three elements found at origins are known to specifically bind proteins. these include the ars essential sequences and the abfp and rapp dna binding sites. we show that the function of ren at the origin cannot be replaced by a rapp dna binding site or a site that binds the transcriptional factor galp and can only be partially substituted for by an abfp recognition sequence. this implies that the role of the ren element at the ars origin is specific, and suggest that the frequency of origin firing in eukaryotic cells may be regulated by origin specific enhancers.
