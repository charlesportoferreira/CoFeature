varying the number of telomere bound proteins does not alter telomere length in teldelta cells.. . yeast telomere dna consists of a continuous, approximately bp tract of the heterogeneous repeat tg( ) with irregularly spaced, high affinity sites for the protein rapp. yeast monitor, or count, the number of telomeric rapp c termini in a negative feedback mechanism to modulate the length of the terminal tg( ) repeats, and synthetic telomeres that tether rapp molecules adjacent to the tg( ) tract cause wild type cells to maintain a shorter tg( ) tract. to identify trans acting proteins required to count rapp molecules, these same synthetic telomeres were placed in two short telomere mutants. ykudelta (which lack the yeast ku protein) and teldelta (which lack the yeast ortholog of atm). although both mutants maintain telomeres with approximately bp of tg( ), only ykudelta cells maintained shorter tg( ) repeats in response to internal rapp molecules. this distinct response to internal rapp molecules was not caused by a variation in rapp site density in the tg( ) repeats as sequencing of teldelta and ykudelta telomeres showed that both strains have only five to six rapp sites per bp telomere. in addition, the teldelta short telomere phenotype was epistatic to the unregulated telomere length caused by deletion of the rapp c terminal domain. thus, the length of the tg( ) repeats in teldelta cells was independent of the number of the rapp c termini at the telomere. these data indicate that teldelta cells use an alternative mechanism to regulate telomere length that is distinct from monitoring the number of telomere binding proteins.
