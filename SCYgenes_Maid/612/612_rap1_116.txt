spreading of transcriptional repressor sir from telomeric heterochromatin.. . telomeric genes and the hm loci in saccharomyces cerevisiae are transcriptionally repressed and adopt a heterochromatin like structure. the trans acting factors rap, sir and sir are required for telomeric and hm silencing, and are thought to be chromosomal, but how they contribute to histone dependent repression of adjacent chromatin is unclear. sir suppresses silencing defects in histones, is limiting for silencing adjacent to telomeres, and interacts with the h and h amino termini in vitro. here we show that sir co immunoprecipitates sir, rap and histones from cellular extracts, suggesting the presence of large chromatin associated protein complexes. crosslinking experiments show that sir is present at hmra, hmlalpha and telomeres in vivo, and that is spreads from telomeric regions into adjacent chromatin when overexpressed. thus sir is a structural component of yeast heterochromatin, repressing adjacent genes as it spreads along the chromosome.
