the n terminal and c terminal domains of rap are dispensable for chromatin opening and gcn mediated his activation in budding yeast.. . repressor activator protein (rap) assists gcn mediated his activation by overcoming some repressive aspect of chromatin structure to facilitate gcn binding. rap also participates in other nuclear processes, and discrete domains of rap have been shown to have specific properties including dna binding, dna bending, transcriptional activation, and silencing and telomere functions. to investigate whether specific domains of rap are required to &quot;open&quot; chromatin and help gcn to activate the his gene, we examined the abilities of different truncated rap proteins to perturb positioned nucleosomes via a nucleosomal rap site in a yeast episome in vivo, and we tested his activation in yeast strains harboring truncated rap mutants. we found that neither the dna bending domain nor the putative activation domain of rap is required for its ability to perturb the chromatin structure of a plasmid containing a rap site. similarly, neither the putative activation domain nor the n terminal dna bending domain was required for gcn mediated activation of his. we also used a rap(ts) mutant to show that continuous occupancy of the his promoter by rap is required for gcn mediated gene activation.
