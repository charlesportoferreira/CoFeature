telomere length regulation and telomeric chromatin require the nonsense mediated mrna decay pathway.. . rapp localization factor (rlf) is a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene that was identified in a screen for mutants that affect telomere function and alter the localization of the telomere binding protein rapp. in rlf mutants, telomeric silencing is reduced and telomere dna tracts are shorter, indicating that rlf is required for both the establishment and/or maintenance of telomeric chromatin and for the control of telomere length. in this paper, we demonstrate that rlf is allelic to nmd/upf, a gene required for the nonsense mediated mrna decay (nmd) pathway (y. cui, k. w. hagan, s. zhang, and s. w. peltz, mol. cell. biol. . , , and f. he and a. jacobson, genes dev. . , ). the nmd pathway, which requires nmdp/rlfp together with two other proteins, (upfp and upfp), targets nonsense messages for degradation in the cytoplasm by the exoribonuclease xrnp. deletion of upf and upf caused telomere associated defects like those caused by rlf mutations, implying that the nmd pathway, rather than an nmd independent function of nmdp/rlfp, is required for telomere functions. in addition, telomere length regulation required xrnp but not ratp, a nuclear exoribonuclease with functional similarity to xrnp (a. w. johnson, mol. cell. biol. . , ). in contrast, telomere associated defects were not observed in pan, pan, or pan pan strains, which are defective in the intrinsic deadenylation dependent decay of normal (as opposed to nonsense) mrnas. thus, loss of the nmd pathway specifically causes defects at telomeres, demonstrating a physiological requirement for the nmd pathway in normal cell functions. we propose a model in which the nmd pathway regulates the levels of specific mrnas that are important for telomere functions.
