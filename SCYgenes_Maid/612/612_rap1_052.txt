coordinate regulation of yeast ribosomal protein genes is associated with targeted recruitment of esa histone acetylase.. . the esa containing nua histone acetylase complex can interact with activation domains in vitro and stimulate transcription on reconstituted chromatin templates. in yeast cells, esa is targeted to a small subset of promoters in an activator specific manner. esa is specifically recruited to ribosomal protein (rp) promoters, and this recruitment appears to require binding by rap or abf. esa is important for rp transcription, and esa recruitment to rp promoters correlates with coordinate regulation of rp genes in response to growth stimuli. however, following esa depletion, h acetylation decreases dramatically at many loci, but transcription is not generally affected. therefore, the transcription associated targeted recruitment of esa to rp promoters occurs in a background of more global nontargeted acetylation that is itself not required for transcription.
