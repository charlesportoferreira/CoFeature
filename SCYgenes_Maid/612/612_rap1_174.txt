genetic evidence that the meiotic recombination hotspot at the his locus of saccharomyces cerevisiae does not represent a site for a symmetrically processed double strand break.. . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, the binding of the rap protein to a site located between the ' end of the his gene and the ' end of bik stimulates meiotic recombination at both flanking loci. by using strains that contain mutations located in his and bik, we found that most recombination events stimulated by the binding of rap involve his or bik, rather than bidirectional events including both loci. the patterns of aberrant segregation indicate that most of the rap stimulated recombination events do not represent the symmetric processing of a double strand dna break located at the rap binding site.
